Big city vibes right there... Love it!
So at like 3:30pm right fml

I miss Montr√©al so much!
Please let responsible, well Americans visit again.
It kills me that I'm an hour and a half away, have been obsessed and in love with the city my entire life, and I can't even go.
Thos are All the buildings
Woah! I'm assuming you edited in post, what did you do to it? The colors look so... smooth. I'd love to be able to edit my own photos like this (I'm self-taught in Lightroom and pretty comfortable with it, but I've never been able to give that much mood to my shots).
Great photo!
Hey OP, where did you take that pic? I‚Äôve been wanting to go on a rooftop for a while but haven‚Äôt found any available. If you did take it on a rooftop, would you care to indicate me how to access it? Thanks in advance
r/UQAM
Vraiment beau avec le HDR. Les couleurs sont superbes.

This is beautiful!
I wanted to say thanks for the Reddit silver and award! You guys rock üëäüèº
Great shot!
tr√®s beau, j'adore
Tr√®s nice
I miss this beautiful city
Beautiful pic !! I miss this city so much, I would love to come back... please continue to post some picture of Montreal :)
It's a magical place
That's some quality content right here, nice pic OP
Wow, what camera is that
Nice skyline.  And it‚Äôs going to get even better.
Looks like one of those building development cgi mock up
ouh very nice
üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
Kinda strange seeing my university on reddit
My all time favourite city in Canada!
what camera?
Awesome click üëå
Nice shoot, pic for today?
What camera did you use? Nice shot btw
Looks like a ravensberger.
That s a screensaver/ wallpaper
Wow great pic. Thanks for sharing
Nice photo, thats a great view, thanks for sharing.

¬´¬†J'ai pris une photo du centre-ville de Montr√©al durant le coucher de soleil. ¬ª
Thanks a lot! Appreciate it ‚ò∫Ô∏è @lifebynicolas on instagram to see more if you want.
Painfully accurate
Appreciate it ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Montrealer here,    
I will love so much to get back our tourists. The city lost is identity since the pandemic. No tourists, no festivals, no bars,  no fine restaurants, no students and no more downtown workers.  Winter is here and it sucks.  
But you have to get your shit together before we let you in America! The sooner , the better.
Same. I go at least once a year in fall. I miss Montreal so much right now. Other than my house it‚Äôs my favorite place in the world.
Big ones I mean
Thanks! I edited the shot in Lightroom first to get the tones I wanted using the HSL panel. I added some radial filters and reduced the  contrast of the photo then exported to photoshop. From there I did manual dodge and burn to highlight the nice lights. Those are the main rough steps. I would say reducing the contrast, playing with the highlights and HSL panel should be a good way to start. Radial filters help too. Hope that helps!
Same, curious about the answer too!
Looks like Sherbrooke, east of Saint-Laurent.
Hey, I am lucky that I went to my friend's place that has access to this awesome view.
Sherbrooke and St-Lo
Thanks a lot! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
This. Is. Awesome.
I love mini undercover social experiments!
Id√©e quand m√™me nice √ßa.
It would be mad dope if all BIXI stations glowed like this.
r/midlyinteresting
Pretty cool!
Awww √ßa vient de faire ma journ√©e, c‚Äôest ben trop cute ü•∞
damn thats a really strong projector !
Congratulations on your new job in BIXI PR. You should be paid for this!
What a fantastic idea.
Ooh!! This looks so fun!
Bixi and other active transportation methods should implement fun and interactive design like this to make ridership more compelling and fun for users
We need more people like you. Giving people a little bit of excitement during a mundane task is very cool
Awesome! Bixi really should be more colourful and fun, those bikes with the cool designs for the 375e should have been made permament.
I really love this. Well done :)
Bien jou√©!
I personally hated having a BIXI stand in front of my place when I lived in the plateau... that out of the way, you‚Äôre amazing! Awesome idea
A Lightform Mark II, nice
Maybe change the color depending how recently the bike was used. Would be a cool computer vision project
Does the software allow you to change the color if the dock is busy or free ?
That's awesome man, leave it there so I can use it tonight and admire your work haha
Very fun idea!
You're cool üòéüëå
Cool!
Cool!
I had no idea lighting technology like this even existed. Neat.
That is so cool! üòç
Awesome!!
Je connaissais pas √ßa les "Lightform projector", c'est un projecteur pour √©mettre des lumi√®res de diff√©rentes couleurs comme dans les partys, c'est √ßa ? C'est quoi la 3e image ? Le logiciel de gestion ?
This is so cool and creative! What do you use the projector for when it's not enhancing Bixi docks?
We need more people like you.
Haha that's awesome!
Keep it up!
You. I like you.
I love this!!
Nice ! üôå
This is awesome, well done!
What is a lightform projector?
Drolet and Marie-Anne? We were neighbours until a month ago!
That is super cool!
Osti d‚Äôtroll. J‚Äôadore.
/r/nextfuckinglevel
I bet you can't wait until events start again haha.. I have so many VJ friends who are getting desperate now xD
You should propose it to the city to keep the Bixi hubs well lit for when it gets dark!
Please keep doing this haha.
Glad to have such an inventive neighbor! Fun stuff!
That's nice of you :)
Cool. (-: Since you asked about other experiments below: could be really fun to scrape dock status from the bixi site and light up docks that have bikes. Might need to do some Computer Vision work to determine which docks are actually occupied if all the API gives is number of docks in use/empty, but you could use the status change as a trigger for refreshing the CV‚Ä¶ You could even figure out which docks/bikes are disabled if bikes are present in the image but the API says it's empty‚Ä¶

The h√©ros we didnt know existed but needed
If your really interested in this type of thing a good friend of mine who recently moved back to France from here, was working on something in the same realm: https://www.instagram.com/p/COP72viJ3lC/?igshid=1d4db6go3fmfg
If you wanna have a look.
We need more people like you.
I read this as Dick colour
nice but this thread will turn into Fairmount vs St-Viateur
That would make such a great jigsaw puzzle.
I think we can all agree this is a great photo, Montreal bagels are the best, and fresh bagels are amazing.
Zoomed in to make sure it wasn‚Äôt a photo
very cool! best bagels in town
Amazing work - is this for sale or copies of it? üëå
Tr√®s cool mais la vraie question qui nous br√ªle les l√®vres : Fairmount ou saint-viateur?
On devrait avoir un "compteur" du nombre de jours sur le sub sans d√©bat sur les bagels!
Upon closer inspection it‚Äôs obviously a painting but damn did I think it was a photo at first!! You did damn well!
Awesome job! But where is the lineup of people waiting to get some delicious bagels
You should share it with them! They love using user generated content on their social media
Nice! Paintings in this style are sometimes very flat looking, but you do a great job giving everything proper depth, and weight (especially!)
Ton oeuvre est meilleure que leurs bagels
Awesome. Anything for sale?
So you sell prints?? Well done!
T‚Äôaimes les bagels toi hein?
[deleted]
I miss Montr√©al :‚Äô(
Wow! Love it!
Lovely!
Didn't think it was a painting till I read the caption wow
A Montreal landmark!  Beautiful work!
Love the details on the bricks and plants. A really nice style.
Good job! Very well done ‚úÖ
Seriously. How much? I need this.
One of the things I really like about Montreal!!
So nice!
Looks nice.
Beautiful!! You‚Äôve got a real talent.
Wow what a beautiful talent that i unfortuately no not have .
Tr√®s jolie mon ami(e)
This is such a beautiful painting! Love the details. Do you have any social network profile where you share your art?
I miss those bagels
The shadows and reflections in the windows alone make this an astounding achievement. Gorgeous.
I have a soft spot for hyper-detailed paintings like this one. I like that you went the extra mile and included Arahova's weird facade's reflection in the top left window. No one would have noticed if it wasn't there but you did it anyway.
Love it !  Looks like it hasn't changed that much since I took [**this photo**](https://flic.kr/p/cKQTF) back in 2006 üòä
St Viateur, Fairmont... Can we all just agree to continue allowing bagel places to use wood burning ovens?
Gorgeous painting!
love this place !
Beautiful painting. Would make a wonderful canvas! ü•∞
Cool! It needed it!
Wowwww!! I was like wow she painted the glass windows of st viateur. BUT NOO THIS ISNT A PIC
Looks good!
This is giving me such a nostalgic feeling about being able to just fearlessly stroll in (or line up üòÜ) on a whim and grab something delicious.
Whats your @ instagram?
I'm about to leave Montreal for the suburbs, I swear I will still make the 45min drive on Saturday mornings to get my sacred poppy seed bagels.
Plz DM me I would love to buy a print!
Absolutely my favorite place! I miss it. (Moved to Ontario years ago) they always laugh at me when I come in asking for a box of ü•Ø to take home. 
On another note I also picked up pounds of smoked meat at Schwartz  but they have become rude over the years.
Nice feel.
That‚Äôs excellent. The sign is so cool.
Love it!!!!
That‚Äôs sooooo good
Y'a tu un live feed du bordel qui va pogner devant le centre bell?
√Ä ne pas oublier qu'ils ont aussi gagn√© le troph√© Clarence Campbell ce qui est unique aussi.
The entire city is going off right now. You could feel it building up all day.
Dominic Ducharme has shown the world that work from home is the way!
woooohoooo :) √† la saint-jean en plus!
don't riot don't riot don't riot
CRIS DE TABARNAK CA SENT LA COUPE MES GARS
Y a tu des feux d‚Äôartifice au parc jeanne mance ?
[deleted]
F√©licitations d'Edmonton!
Je croyais jamais voir √ßa de ma vie!
I love getting tear gassed
Congrats boys!!! Fuck yes!
The police absolutely lost their minds and turned the biggest party this city has seen in years into a warzone.
EN FIN !!! C'est le temps vraiment ! GOGO HABS ! LA COUPE STANLEY NOUS TTENDS !
Nature is healing!!!
Ah so that explains why people are celebrating outside lol. Can hear the yelling and cars honking
J'etais au C-V pour la toilette durant les entractes avec mon auto. Ma premiere reflexe est GTFO du C-V avant la fin car je ne veux pas de casse sur l'auto...
Incroyable, c'est tellement un beau Beaume pour cette ann√©e covid.
WOOO! Go Habs Go!!!
WOOOO!!
yessir
Great time to be a Habs fan!  Go Habs Go!!!!
Fuck yeah!
Hopefully we won't be asholes like my upstairs neighbors from Vancouver in 2011 who started throwing bottles off the side of our apartment when they lost. Guys, don't be those guys.
Bonne Saint-Jean en tabarnak!! GO HABS GO!
OL√â OL√â OL√â OL√â OL√â OL√â OL√â OL√â OL√â
People are going nuts right now
Oh fuck yeah !!! Woohooo let‚Äôs go
Bonne saint Jean!!!
Woooo √ßa sent la coupe!!!üîµ‚ö™üî¥
OL√â OL√â OL√â OL√â
C'est quand m√™me insane de voir que l'√©quipe que tout le monde semblait √™tre d'accord pour dire √©tait vraiment m√©diocre √† une shot √† gagner la coupe pour la premiere fois en 20 ans lol
J'esp√®re que tout le monde √† de bonnes assurances pour les feux et les √©meutes.
Teams in Las Vegas, Tampa etc So silly. These cities have no business having hockey teams.  I lost interest many expansions ago, but glad to see Our Glorieux back in the finals. Great games.
Wooooooooooooo üó£üó£üó£üó£
We are here!!!!!
On veut Islanders ou Lightning ?
Je vois de Fort Lauderdale, FL. JE SUIS TROP EXCIT√â!!!! Ahhh!!!
I'm so glad I'm off work this week. I was up until about 3 or 4am just reading everything I can about last night on here, on HFboards, on Twitter...
I was 8 in 1993. I remember staying up late watching the games and usually falling asleep, but I was far too young to appreciate it. Last night I had tears in my eyes following the game. I can't imagine how I'll be if we can pull this off.
I'm exhausted, a little hungover and can't wait for Monday.
FUCKYEA D'OSTI
YEAAAAAAAAAAAH!
Sucks I missed the riot
Its coming home; Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa tried and failed.
Leafs will never win as long as HNIC theme exists, so its upto to Habs to bring the Cup up North!
Huh?
Been cheering for the Habs the entire playoffs. Much love from Cincinnati, a city without an NHL team! Allez les Habs!
Fuck you Luc Ferrandez. Drette dans le cul.
[removed]
Delta variant incoming. But, but hockey eh.
Je veux sinc√®rement comprendre. J'ai jamais √©t√© fan d'une √©quipe sportive. Pour moi c'est juste une compagnie priv√©e compos√©e de millionnaires qui se crissent pas mal de l'endroit o√π ils jouent.
Comment t'en viens √† occorder autant d'importance √† √ßa ?
Snapchat map
This is a nice vibe
I adore this was well, you should consider making prints! It has this gorgeous retro feel to it, the angles, the colors\~ <3
Caught your post in r/analog. Gonna upvote it here at home, too.
The composition really works for me. \*chef's kiss\*
Nicely done. An interesting composition.
I especially like the cooler colours of the stadium, tower & sky in the background juxtaposed with the warmer hues of the foreground and sweeping structure in the upper right.
I wonder if this would work as well as a B&W version?
Excellent candidate for r/liminalspace
Je ne sais pourquoi mais sexy!
Jamais vu le stade sous cet angle, nice shot !
i like it! definitely captures the 70s style! i have taken so many cool shots there. my favourite building in the world!
If anyone is interested this was taken on medium format film around the end of summer last year. It was a ghost town around there!
What film did you use(if this was analog)?
That‚Äôs gorgeous.
Great composition
I would print and frame this
Wow.. simple beautiful photo..
I'll add to the chorus saying if you made prints I'd buy one
Awesome composition!
This is awesome! Looks so modern
Tr√®s belle photo!!
solid Olympic Games '76 vibes
Your composition is great, thank you for sharing this photo!
Wow I wanna make an album to fit this album cover!
The composition is super great! Keep it up
Love it!
Looks like a postcard, dope work!
Camera, settings and lens?
Love it. Reminds me of Adrien Heberts paintings of the old port.
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
Super nice! Look like a painting.
Great dynamic lines!!!
Freshening to see it from that POV.   
Thanks for sharing!
I love the unintended Starfleet Academy feel to it.
1:1 aspect best aspect
Awesome shot :) I really like how the blue of the tables contrasts the rest of the scene! What film did you use for this?
r/fakealbumcovers material
Like in those magazines from 60s looking towards the future. Retrofuturism.
Oh, you should definitely post it to r/LiminalSpace they'd live it over there. :)
Thought I was in r/retrofuturism
Nice shot and great use of the square format.
Great shot! I love the angle and composition.
I don't know why but I did this:  
https://imgur.com/gallery/cENNiS1
That composition is actually insane, good pic!!
You just gave me a wave of nostalgia of that place. I loved going to the Biod√¥me when I was a kid. The photo is clean af though.
The photo is absolutely gorgeous (thanks OP!!), though i do find it sad how projects like this end up underutilized. Whenever i go visit (save for games of course), its practically a ghost town. I really hope in the future we learn to strike a good balanced between modern architecture and human-centric design. Places like this could be so much more lively!
I think r/liminalspace would like this
This is really cool! Any chance i could pick up a print in Montreal to save the shipping fee?
√áa doit pas √™tre a Montr√©al, je ne vois pas la muraille de Leonard Cohen.
Yo. This is my new iMac and iPhone wallpaper. Thanks its insane
There's literally no way to know which *decade* this photo was taken in, and I love it. Great shot!
Great pic!
I've been living on the west coast for a few years and this made me realize I miss *architecture*.
Ceci est de la pornographie g√©om√©trique
Wow, c'est vraiment impressionnant
J'ai eu l'aide de quelques autres personnes, mais la majorit√© est de moi
Incroyable. Fini le! Je veux la murale de Leonard Cohen.
Beau travail !
Wow. C'est trop cool! Penses tu releaser √ßa quand vous aurez fini? J'aimerais trop y marcher!
Damn that's seriously impressive
Je suis super impressionn√© dude!
Et inquiet pour ta sante mentale XD
Ca donne le gout de macheter minecraft juste pour visiter ce que tas fait
Je comprends si tu veux prot√©ger ton travail, mais est-ce que √ßa serait possible d'avoir l'honeur de t√©l√©charger cette map? Je suis pr√™te √† payer un petit frais si c'est n√©cessaire. Si non, il n'y a pas de probl√®me!
Sti de belle job
J'esp√®re que tu jouais pas en mode survie üòÇ
Wow!!!
Putain! Tr√®s fort
Je pensais que c‚Äô√©tait une photo, wow.
Whoa! C‚Äôest compl√®tement fou!! Quel travail. J‚Äôadore le pack de texture; le *haze* vraiment parfait!
J'avais vue il y a un moment un projet Minecraft  de recr√©er la terre en 1:1 ou pr√®s. Est-ce que tu fais partie de se projet?
Jesus Christ !! Bravoü§ô
Hallucinant!
Woah. What filter are you using? Looks very realistic!
Beau travaille well done
T'es une machine..wow
Je vois mon bureau! Ce que les gens font avec Minecraft m'impressionne toujours, mais l√†, chapeau!
Would love for a Godzilla to walk among those amazing buildings! Great job
Magnifique, bravo!
Beau travail :D
Holy shit
omg cest vraiment cool la place ville marie va etre je pense un challenge :D
My mind is absolutely blown. How many hours did you put into this?
That is actually incredible, what kind of shaders are those? It would be great to have a server like that up and running
T‚Äôas mis le preacher de jesus avec ses pancartes au coin de mcgill et st cath? Beau travail!!
Tu devrais le mettre sur r/gaming
Damn that's awesome üëå
WOW
F√©licitations ! Tr√®s bien fait !
wow, only after the 3rd pic did I realize these are not real photos.
Holy shit, this is insane
Wow!!! Represent!
Malade!
capot√© esti, un grand bravo.
INSANE , le Metro ??
Great job! This is impressive. It looks just.. Awesome.
On se distrait comme on peut durant les confinements! Bravo, tr√®s impressionnant!
C'est super beau, f√©licitation :) L√† il faut le faire en lego, hehe. Vraiment un super travail, la ville devrait te l'acheter pour la promotion de la ville, so nice :)
Animals vibes
oh wow! jsuis s√ªr que beaucoup de gens paierait pour avoir le fichier pour simplement se promener dedans sur le mode cr√©atif.
Tr√®s bien!
Merci et Bravo! Continue comme √ßa!
C‚Äôest fucking cool guy!
Awesome!!
Vraiment cool.

Ooh, I'd like to check this out IRL. Which stretch of St Laurent is this on? I suppose near Duluth?
Bon enfin des candidats qu‚Äôon aura envie de cajoler! Il a mon vote. Vas-y Gustave marque ton territoire sur les pancartes √† Coderre üò∫
MTL is very creative
"Miauler ensemble" üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Honn√™tement cette √©lection me pue tellement au nez que si ces minou avaient √©t√© une option genre Rhino, un d'entre eux aurait eu mon vote.
He's got my vote
I'll vote for them more! Very cool
Photoshop skills on point
Je fais toujours des blagues √† propos des √©lecteurs lib√©raux qui ne r√©fl√©chissent plus et qui voteraient pour un chimpanz√© s'il se pr√©sentait pour PLQ ou PLC, alors je n'ai aucune difficult√© √† croire que ce chat pourrait gagner ses √©lections!
Oh - think Gustave is harmless? Then what happened to the goldfish?
For a safer Montreal for Fish - vote Sheldon
I am voting for Sheldon he looks very lazy

C'est quand m√™me un appui aux Lib√©raux? Tant qu'√† faire, pourquoi pas avoir invent√© un parti ou au moins un nom parodique? J'en ai tu manqu√© un bout?
Hahah....I remember a few years ago there was a website called TRASH TA PANCARTE, during the provincial election. People would post pics of local election posters that had been defaced. It was fucking hilarious
I absolutely LOVE this! üòÇ I‚Äôm from Toronto and always make a point to visit that cat caf√© when I‚Äôm there! Gustave would get my vote! Ha!
Got my vote
I wish that Philadelphia had this kind of spirit.
Well fuk they have my vote

Oof the cat is not very happy lol
Not voting this year. Sorry Gustave.
Le parti chat majoritaire!
Oh hell yeah!!

WTF
Not OP but I saw these outside Segal‚Äôs today - so at St Laurent and Duluth haha
Outside segal market near st Laurent blvd/ ave Duluth.
And yes my friend sent me another conservative party poster from another street.
You‚Äôre either on Stanley or Drummond facing Sherbrooke
Very cool! You definitely got the feel of MTL captured!
you could sell this! its gorgeous :)
You should put this on a shirt!
I often see posts like this and go meh, yours is truly stunning. Has this great anime background style
That is pretty fucking awesome dude. You got some talent!
I think art that celebrates artists' home towns are lovely. You did a wonderful job!
That's really nice
Fantastic
This is really beautiful! You‚Äôre very talented.
How long did it take you to draw this?
how much!? üíµüíµüíµüí¢
Needs more cranes and pilons
C'est magnifique! Mtl me manque tellement!
This is beautiful. Do you do this professionally? As in, do you sell your artwork?
Great work, Origin Protocol just opened a form for people to individually drop their art there. Worth a look if youre interested in selling your impressive art. TY for sharing !
[deleted]
Amazing- I wanna buy it - pm me in case you wanna sell it.
Impressive !
Me likey.
I like your style, great work!
Lovely! Stylish work.
Do you draw other cities in Canada?
C‚Äôest vraiment magnifique!
I live in that building on the right (large, brown one) on Drummond and instantly recognized it. Very well done thank you for sharing.
Nice ! Is it watercolour or felt pens?
[deleted]
That would make a cool comic book!
Beautiful! That must have taken you forever to draw?
[deleted]
You have a page or instagran with your art?
Beautiful üòç
I want this so bad!! Would you be interested in selling it?
Has a really nice feel. Do you pencil rough it all first?
Do you sell your artwork? I‚Äôm looking to buy!
... and you managed to make it look really ugly. Maybe next time don't make your focal point generic brown apartment building, a narrow street and flat rooftops?
Wow you‚Äôre correct-it‚Äôs Stanley!
I‚Äôm glad you think that! Thank you!
Aww thanks!!
Ooo that would be fun!
Haha I‚Äôm glad you think this!
Aww that‚Äôs so kind thank you!
I completely agree! Thank you very much
Thank you!
Thank you :)
Very sweet thank you
I drew it a year ago so I don‚Äôt remember exactly. It for sure took more than a day (of course with breaks)
I completely agree
Merci beaucoup!
Aww thank you. I‚Äôve been wanting to sell prints for ages but never ended up putting it together. Hopefully soon!
Est dans le bon quartier en plus
Je suis heureux de savoir qu‚Äôil y aura quelque chose de familier qui m‚Äôaccueillera quand je d√©m√©nage √† Montr√©al de Vancouver cet automne.
Histoire dr√¥le, une fois je sortait de la station Champs-De-Mars puis un homme viens me demander "est ce que tu connais ou est la rue barr√©?" Je pensait que j'√©tait dans une √©mission cam√©ra cach√©e j'ai presque r√©pondu "euh partout". C'est la journ√©e que j'ai d√©couvert qu'il y a en fait l'uniqe et originale Rue Barr√©.
Les beau c√¥nes oranges üòçü•∞ c'est vraiment cool que la ville de Montr√©al a d√©cid√© de les choisir comme animales symbolique de la ville !!
definitely better than naming all streets after douchebag politicians. more of non political names!!
Imagin√© un panneau de construction √©crit : "rue barr√©e, d√©tour sur rue Barr√©"
La rue Coneoranger devrait etre un candidat a mourial!
I see what you did there
Shit, that‚Äôs funny!
Lmao that hits home
Il y a aussi "De la barre" √† Longueuil
I once lived on the street.
I did my driving school downtown and the instructor had me pass there one day to mess with me. What does that sign mean? Barr√©, you can't pass, just kidding it's the name of the street.
La fois ou Chapleau a fait une caricature de Nadal qui tenait un cone orange en guise de troph√© de la coupe Rogers.
Bien sur!
Elle est bonne lol
Cette conversation va nulle part !
Rue "je me suis barr√©"
Les r√©sultats dans Google Maps sont dr√¥les: 239 r√©sultat pour rue "barr√©e".
Vote Valerie Plante out of office in November and get rid of these ‚Äúrues barr√©es‚Äù.
Hey voisin!
Familiarise toi avec les cones de construction. Tu vas en voir souvent
Si tu connais les nids de poules tu seras en terrain connu.
Il y en a plus d‚Äôanciens Montrealais anglophones a Vancouver qu‚Äôil y en a d‚Äôanglophones a Montreal. Bonne chance, mon ami.
Le pire c‚Äôest qu‚Äôils tournent souvent Les Gags de Juste pour rire dans le Vieux. J‚Äôaurais eu le m√™me r√©flexe que toi!
I once worked on the street.
Jme rappelle quand la rue barr√© √©tait barr√©e, jme suis fait des self-jokes pas mal souvent en sortant du metro.
J‚Äôai fait mon baccalaur√©at √† UBC, la ¬´¬†university of building and construction¬†¬ª alors √ßa ne m‚Äôinqui√®te trop.
Il n'y a pas de nid de poule √† Montr√©al, juste des nids d'autruche!
Je peux pas d√©cider, pourquoi pas les deux?
Garda?
Bonne chance aller n'importe ou sans voir les superbes cones de Montr√©al, mais on s'habitue quand meme. 
Bienvenue dans ta nouvelle ville, c'est quand m√™me beau Montr√©al. Les cones, les nie de poulles les clochard et les personne compl√®tement fucker, les pannes de metro et la difficult√© a ce trouver un stationnement. Les policiers z√®le.
Les loyer trop chere Etc.
A par √ßa, c'est beau. Les gents et la musique, spectacles et quand ils ouvres les rue pour les pi√©ton. Je suis partie a cause de la covid, mais montreal me manques beaucoup.
Bon d‚Äôaccord, vous avez raison.
The whole street is basically Garda now.
Pas comme gardien de s√©curit√©, mais dans le b√¢timent de Garda, oui.
Hey everyone, hope I haven't been spamming the sub too hard with my work, but I hope you'll indulge me this last time. Looks like the pandemic is wrapping up, and tomorrow I go back to my day job. Covid has been a weird, scary, boring, uncertain time, but one thing that I'll always be grateful for is how it allowed me to focus on my art and live for myself. So on this last day, I wanted to challenge myself, to see what I could come up with, sun up to sun down. I think it came out pretty good for a rush job! Hope you all enjoy it, thanks so much for all the support and kind words you've shared over the past few weeks. You guys are great! If you want to see all my previous destructions, I'm on insta, @apocalypse_montreal
I think this is the best one yet. Nailed the window art.
The SAKE is a nice touch.
PLEASE DO THE COCO RICO JUST BESIDES IT 
Also has S tier poulet r√¥ti at a low price and the Nata are fucking top notch
I like the garbage bag. Nice touch. The alley beside Schwartzs smells like absolute shit, full of smoked meat scraps baking in the summer sun. Just taking all that stank in as you wait in line to get inside.
That‚Äôs awesome
https://i.imgur.com/kDJjsdh.gifv
This is insanely on-point, both accurate and detailed. You're doing some great work, man.
√áa manque de cones oranges mais j'adore :)
I used to live near that one and you did an great job.
I don‚Äôt know how awards work but I had 24 hours to give that bear to a post, take it
Excellent, as usual. Bravo!
Holy fuck!!
Wow true artistry. 
I'm very drunk and depressed right now but this is making some cylinders fire.
If anyone wants to reach out. I just need some anonymous shooting the shit moments.
This is absolutely amazing work.
I feel like your artistry will breathe life back into Montreal
Whatever it is
Keep it burning
Schwasted at Schwartz‚Äôs
Should still have a line up of Zombies outside!
Anyway to buy them? Or have custom done based on pictures? That's could be a jobs.
Tr√®s bien fait
Looks awesome
This is dope! Thanks for the eye candy
If the covid lockdowns go any longer you can market your art as "exact scale replicas"
I'd still eat from there in a zombie apocalypse
This is awesome!
I really like your work man. I love to visit old abandoned building, it gives me the feeling of being somewhere else. When i look at your stuff i feel the same feeling! I really like the small touches you add, like the SAKE graffiti haha.
Wow this is awesome and so inspiring, I'd love to do this kind of art maybe I'll try
Omg! This is amazing!! Absolutley loving it. Hitting up your insta.
This is really good, well done.
Those trash bag are huge ahah. Nice work man!
Schwartz, good choice
J'adore! Very well done
Love it, has a Fallout 4 / 76 flavour to it!
yo this is lit
are these for sale or do you do commissions? I have a pal who is a habs fan that would probably enjoy something on the subject? Maybe suggest a price to me via DM or here...
These are some buge garbage bags...
Nice
Surprised no one told you to do the Main restaurant across the street instead of Schwartz
That's really, really cool, love it! Keep'em coming :)
Do you sell your work? Have a website showcasing it? If you don't, I think you should xD
Really love your stuff man. Sad I won't see more of it on the sub but I'm happy for you at the same time that you can work again.
On respecte l'autopromotion quand la promotion n'est pas de la marde ;)
I absolutely love your stuff!!! Please keep posting.
Dude seeing your stuff makes me so happy, you're super good at it! These look great every time and I hope you find the time to do more :)
I really enjoyed looking at your art! It's been a fun ride for us too.
I would love to see you put all these models you've made over the year (brilliant btw) into a model train set, where you also create custom max max style trains.
your work is fun. Keep it up
It‚Äôs been wonderful. This work is one of my favorites. I think this place is already like this in my head
Thanks! It's funny, this is the model I spent the least amount of time on. I guess practice pays off! I spent the day with my dog taking reference pictures of various tags about town.
What is SAKE?
Dog, if I do the Coco Rico, I'm gonna have to do the whole damn street. Which I'll probably end up doing eventually, because nobody's told me to stop yet.
Coco Rico is so good, god damn I miss it
I think the garbage bags are my favorite part, even if I made them a bit too big. I'ma fix it tomorrow.
The alley smell is the first thing I thought of!
That's a beautiful photo!
Oh hi seb
That's a great picture. It'd make a cool album cover.
r/bladerunner
Nice shot!
Nice photo! What was this taken with?
Magique üíõ
So pretty \*\_\*
WOW!
Absolutley amazing!
Beautiful shot. /r/cityporn would enjoy.
nice picture
corner of what
Great photo!  If that is close to D√©carie and Sherbrooke then I lived in that high-rise lol.
Marcil and Sherbrooke? I grew up one street down.
Wow, tellement beau üòçüíõ
Bon, on va finir 2020 pulv√©ris√©s par le Death Star?
That sounds like an English street name.
This is great
I can't believe Luke Smith is sunsetting the entire city of Montreal now.
C'est tr√®s joli, beautiful, serh sch√∂n
What a beautiful scene üòç
That's beautiful. Great shot!
hey seb! long time no see
wowwwww
Wow wonderful
Damn this happened on my birthday. BEAUTIFUL
I totally stole this üî•
I used to live in that tall building back there ‚ù§Ô∏è
Good job mon pot. Bien jou√©.
Gorgeous
So, will those anglos ever truly get qu√©b√©cois culture?
Fuck bombardier
Thank you!
Who's this!
Thank you! Appreciate the comment.
Yes! That was actually part of my inspiration in the editing of the pic. If you want to see the other pics from the shoot, you can find them here:

Hi Alex, I took this with my Nikon Z6 using the 300MM Nikon F4 AF-S. You can check out my IG if you want to see more photos from the set! [https://www.instagram.com/seb.furtado/](https://www.instagram.com/seb.furtado/)
Merci :) !!
It was a beautiful scene!
Merci :)
Thanks so much!
I'm a noob, can I cross-post this?
Thanks John! It was the corner of Marcil / Sherbrooke near Girouard Park.
Yes it is! It's the corner of Marcil / Sherbrooke facing West down Sherbrooke.
I‚Äôm slightly concerned that a bear in a wig grew up in such a densely populated neighbourhood üòÇ
Merci :)
Il y a un grand probabilit√©!!
It does! The town of Sherbrooke in Quebec is named after a British General whose full name is Sir John Coape Sherbrooke. I wonder if the street is also named after him.
Magnifique. Selon¬†m√©t√©omedia la lune rouge serait caus√©e par la fum√©e de plusieurs centaines de feux de for√™t actifs √† l'ouest du pays.
That's a beautiful mural dedicated to the late Anthony Bourdain üòç
Excellent photograph!
C'est une des plus belles photos que j'ai vu ici. Je trouve √ßa tr√®s cool que la lune semble vouloir se coucher sur Leonard Cohen
Absolutely beautiful photograph!
Nice aligment.
With a little Cohen thrown in! Love it‚Ä¶
Cool reflexion of the moon in the St-Laurent. Well done!
Reminds me of the Conan background
üòç
I have a great view of the full moon here, it was just beautiful! of course it's overcast now, but it would be still almost full. You could also see Jupiter, very bright to the left of the moon.
beautiful
Wow! Thanks for all the love guys! My brother is not on Reddit, so I‚Äôll pass on the lovely comments to him. If you want to see more of his pics, check out his Instagram @cjnphotography
Majestic!
Magnifique photo. Leonard serait honor√©!
That's the best I've seen of last night's full moon.  Bravo to your brother
ITS CHEESE, GROMIT
I love that picture with Leonard Cohen looking and smiling
That man is staring at me.
‚ÄòMoon over Montreal‚Äô sounds like Denny‚Äôs next advertised sandwich
Does he have Instagram?
That is no moon. It's a space station.
Nice
Beautiful shot,beautiful city!!
Wow!
Bro thats a 7 days to die blood moon. Run
Yep, took a photo then photoshopped the shite out of it.
Que c'est beau la fin du monde üòä
A lot of people confuse between them 2 but Anthony Bourdain mural is on sheerbroke/stanley
It‚Äôs Leonard Cohen
Lol XD
Thanks! I‚Äôll let him know!
He does! @cjnphotography
This is a legit, one shot photo. He takes his time, tracks the moon through an app on his phone, gets to his spot hours before to set up his camera and takes a ton of photos. That night , luck and prep was on his side.
Thanks! I'll give him a follow
Instead of asking "do they need renovations?", shouldn't we be asking "why does it need such extensive renovations?"?
Remember [this one](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/plateau-apartment-building-condemned-1.4855351) from a couple of years ago? 
It's about a five minute walk from the one on Papineau. The owners let it get so rundown that the city evacuated the building. Then the owners renovated it and are now charging $1500 for a studio apartment with a fucking murphy bed. 
Stop defending shitty landlords.
Lol that place needs renovations badly. I used to deliver heating oil there and shits falling apart
I'm certainly not for loopholes for renters, I've been one forever and I've had to fight at times with landlords as well. 
Looking at the balconies it would seem like they legit do need reno's?
I understand people don‚Äôt want to loose their home, and are fighting to stay there. But let‚Äôs be honest : the place is in ruin and tenants pay next to nothing, which would certainly not allow the new owner to renovate and make money out of the building. It‚Äôs sad but this is reality : good location and good building don‚Äôt come cheap. You can‚Äôt blame the guy to want to make money out of his investment. He is not in the business to do charity work
Context: [https://globalnews.ca/news/7741803/residents-of-montreal-apartment-building-fight-renoviction-take-protest-to-their-balconies/](https://globalnews.ca/news/7741803/residents-of-montreal-apartment-building-fight-renoviction-take-protest-to-their-balconies/)
What is it with so many people blowing the capital investors? There's something really fucking wrong with you if you think a capital investment firm making money takes priority over housing low-income people.
On verra ce que l'inspecteur de la ville va dire. Quand on renove, on blame les proprios, mais quand c'est rendu completement en ruine on blame aussi les proprios.
[deleted]
Our government doesnt care or do anything about this, especially during covid. They are too busy imposing curfews.
Good news for them, the court said that the homeless people are exempt so if they dont find some place else to go....
getting mad Arkanoid vibes
I see many members of Facebook landlord groups polluting this subreddit. Well up yours.
The Shillers are at it again...
We got evicted two summers ago due to this. PoPire told us that they got the number of cases in a week which they used to get in a year. I do miss my place in St Henri.
Wow, il y a des gens qui ont pass√© 40-50 ans comme locataire.
The landlords willfully neglect their rental properties ,allow degradation and leave renovations ignored for years due to the fact that it is easier to implement renovation evacuations with intention of getting the low rents up to competitive current market standards. Rent increases on existing tenants are governed and they do not keep up with inflation and other costs. Landlords see their existing tenants as liabilities.
Provided yesterday's riots. How come protesters always want to destroy stores of innocent people, but never want to destroy homes of very very bad and very very rich people like Shiller and Kornbluth?
They took over rue Masson a couple of years ago and rents went through the roof.
The building is run by private owners. A coperation is an entity with rights and responsibilities. The private owners and their coperation bought the building in order to make a profit.
 We live in a capitalist system. Capitalism gives private owners power to use their property or assets to control the economy. 
The government has no power to control the economy since the government also depends on the capitalist and capitalism to exist.
Humanism and Capitalism can never go hand in hand. 
The landlords are capitalists looking to capitalize.
Landlords did not fail Montreal.
The leadership in Montreal failed its people.
The blame is on the government for not legislating and for not creating protections for human beings who NEED housing.
The moment someone owns another person's right or right to access a means to a right ...it is impossible to stop greed and exploitative practices.
C'est la nouvelle norme... and it sucks...
At the end of the day it‚Äôs all about $$$ for the building owner. Pointe finale.
Why are you upset at the building owners? If you want a system that gives everyone a safe and clean place to live at an affordable price, then blaming landlords and contractors isn't the right approach. The building owners never promised to house anyone without profit.
If you want to make a better system, then don't live in these properties. Find the co-ops in the area and join them. You'll notice their buildings are functional, plain and generally a little run-down but livable. [Check here for co-ops around Montreal.](https://fechimm.coop/en/cooperatives)
Support the system you want, stop buying into the system you don't want.
My low rise landlord in Toronto is replacing the water pipes, upgrading the wiring and electrical panel, replacing the radiators, replacing the doors, kitchen sink, toilet. Refinishing the bath tub. Balcony repairs. And all without evicting anyone.
The landlords are two of the scummiest people ever.
√áa arrive aussi dans la rue Basile-Patenaude. Des vieux blocs appart vont √™tre chang√©s en condos de luxe et les locataires sont mis dehors.
 J'habite proche et je connais des locataires de ces blocs, il y a qui ont v√©cu l√† plus de 20 ans et ils sont d√©molis, ils savent pas o√π ils vont aller mais il y a peu de chances qu'ils puissent rester dans Rosemont.
[removed]
Presque un Tic Tac Toe, Presque!
I got demovicted from my home of 10 12 years a few years back. It sucks hard
This is why its important to work hard and buy your own house this is bullshit one day you wake up and they tell you to leave no my house my rules fuck renting
The building is old and dilapidated. Hillpark likely bought the building at a premium and need to recoup.  I see no problem with them.  Blame the government for lax regulation and inviting housing speculation.
Ah yes, Montreal. Home of the "pie in the sky" economic philosophy.
General rule.  If the building has that slanty shelter over it's entrance that looks like the Charlie Brown shirt, the building is an absolute shit hole.
Or we could work hard, stick it out, and buy our own property. Or is that a scandalous thing to say?
I know many landlords that have lost their homes and apartments due to tenants living free....landlords have a load of bills to pay. They‚Äôre not welfare.
J'l'ai vu de mes propres yeux, c'est vrai!
owner supposed to spend 25,000$ on renovations and then the tenant complains when the rent goes up 25$.
Ya but buisness is buisness
And that's how you win the meme wars
If you let more buildings be built upwards, rent prices will fall. It really is as simple as supply and demand. NIMBYs and people selfishly holding onto their single detached homes and small 3-story triplexes are the problem.
Disgusting and horrifying. The government better not allow this.
[deleted]
Landlords are parasites. Their property should be taken away from them and given to the people
Gonna get downvoted but Renters have too many rights right now... you don‚Äôt own the place, somebody else does and if he wants you out he should be able to push you out. It‚Äôs not the owners problem about you not having anywhere else to live, he owns that property, you‚Äôre just renting.
I thought Montreal was in Canada?  Why are the signs written in french, are they surrendering?
When shit gets this bad, the landlord should be forced to pay for the renovations, the lodging of tennants while it's being rennovated at their own cost, and let them back on the previous rent. Your job as a landlord is to provide a habitable place for your tenants, if you failed at that to the point that their living space isn't safe anymore, you've been criminaly negligent.
I always thought owners let their properties get bad so they can evict everyone to renovate and charge more for rent
When the one on Marie-Anne was allowed to fall into disrepair, that's all you needed to know about Projet Montreal wasn't "for the people." They let the lower-income folks out on the street where they would have to find accommodations outside the Plateau.
And now this one on Papineau. PM is all about the gentrification of the Plateau and close surrounding areas.
A grain of salt on this one. I live a couple of blocks down from there on Marquette and Marie Anne, the place was an utter dump. It had police there nearly every second night and people drinking and doing drugs out front all the time. 
I took a look at the new place post renovations. It's not Murphey beds, you aren't telling the full story. The places are really nice inside and the area is better for it.
Are you serious about the 1500$ murphy bed price point??
Extensive renovations = mould. Magic eviction word of the day.
But that's the market, that's what people like , you can't have it both ways , everything dies
Better move their cars.
After living in that area for a few years, all I see are bedbugs and mice problems. 
For the uninitiated, beautiful as always!
All i can think of is how much those row houses must cost
Beautiful. Montreal is so beautiful ü§©
I caught the sunrise today too. So glad I was up early. Well, technically, I haven't slept yet. Covid life got my schedule all messed up. But anyway, yes, the sunrise was cool :)
My road had no parking signs and they didn't even clear it. Hundreds of cars moved but snow not touched
Bon matin :)
I miss my old hood.
Grew up in little burgundy. Love this place forever
üëå
Beautiful picture
waaaaah
Nice sky !
Nice shot!
Nice shot!
Same here in Laval this morning
Cool. There‚Äôs also a little burgundy in the sky.
I snapped a sunrise photo from my backyard in NDG, brilliant red. I nearly froze but it was so pretty. However, a red sunrise means bad weather!
I'm glad I moved out of the city, They still haven't removed the snow
Il y a un quartier qui s‚Äôappelle ¬´¬†Little Burgundy¬†¬ª √† Montr√©al?
My first thought was "they have one minute to move their cars"
I recently moved to Little Burgundy and you just triggered my anxiety now.
Hello from ile bizard my friend. What a small world even if we are on montreal subreddit
There‚Äôs one for sale right now asking $995k üòØ
It's luxury housing!
It's usually nicer when the snow hasn't been removed. Once they do it's all black/brown slush.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Burgundy
Weeeeeyoooooo weeeeeyooooooo hoooonk hoooonk!!!
Lived here for 2-3 years. Mice problems are real, especially in apartments.
Hi! It's much quieter here than downtown certainly!
Oh wow I found the listing, only 2 upstairs bedrooms and doesn‚Äôt even have parking. Yikes. Very attractive looking house though.
Compared to some other prices I've seen for far uglier properties, that's not so bad.
Saw a house that looked like a cube built in the 60s for well over 1 million.  I'm still half convinced it's some kind of money laundering scheme because I've seen much much much nicer places for that price.
The same house in most any other big city in N America would be 4x the price
C‚Äôest vraiment de l‚Äôh√©g√©monie linguistique
I have had mice at 3 different places in Montreal lol.
But haven't heard of bedbugs. In Toronto I wasn't so lucky though
I had mice in a building in NDG years ago, they were everywhere! 
If you can get a cat, that's always a good idea. Dogs, not so much, they're useless.
Probably will put mice poison and/or traps in my crawlspace/basement after reading this, haha!
Mice are everywhere in Montreal except Westmount. In Westmount there are only rats.
I love it here. 30 minutes away from downtown but feels like the country side. The forest we have here is also a gem.
It depends on the location more than anything. Across the street from me is one of those ugly mid 50's brick boxes. But it's a duplex and it's selling for 1.2M
It's kind of nuts.
Compared to the montreal median income that's not a real important distinction
So 4 million? Not sure that high...
Ta juste a dire que tu connais pas Montreal...
[deleted]
La petite bourgogne est la depuis longtemps mon grand. Ca a ete incorpore au d√©but du 20ieme si√®cle. Faut s'informer avant de dire des niaiseries.
Had mice in Verdun and own 2 dogs. Watched a mouse run over the big dog's tail. Absolutely useless.
30 year resident. We got both. Ive had a pigeon fly through too
Et le d√©lai de vente est un peu sous 2 mois pour une unifamiliale sur l'√Æle en ce moment. Malgr√© les prix, il y a des acheteurs √† la pelle.
Dans le Plateau Mont-Royal, les maisons de ville sont rendus √† 1.1 millions prix m√©dian. 29 jours le d√©lai de vente lol.
Pis le pire que c'est que le reste de la province y pris un virage dans la m√™me direction en acc√©l√©r√©. Investissez dans l'immobilier, il y va avoir du locataire.

little burgundy √ßa existe pas, la petite bourgogne oui
Je me fous compl√®tement du hockey (du sport en g√©n√©ral) mais c'est vraiment hot comme photo. Plus Montr√©al que √ßa, tu meurs. Nice.

Great pic. Where is this? I have a similar one on my phone.
You better do this again. No one is allowed to do anything different tonight!
Montreal is such a cool city.  I miss it, and I want to go back
More than 8 people. Im calling the cops.
The only true game of yesterday was the Champions League final.
Moi aussi je me fous compl√®tement du hockey! Et j'adore la photo üòÄ

new game : Let's guess the alley !
Yes Chambord et St Joseph
En ostifi
J'ai remarqu√© le texte du Jersey que avec les commentaires de ce post
Plateau vers le parc laurier
There is another comment where people are trying to guess the alley (hint : close to pace laurier)
So far there is nothing prepared. But I hope they will do it again
Get out o here. ALLEZ MONTR√âAL
>Lol √† chaque fois
Je pense que j'ai vu la phrase "je m'int√©resse pas au hockey" deux fois dans ce sub au cours des six derniers mois.
Pourquoi tu prends √ßa si personnel, bro? Qu'est-ce-que √ßa peut bien te foutre que j'aime pas les sports? √áa t'emp√™che pas toi de t'y int√©resser apr√®s tout.
Ta r√©ponse est d'ailleurs une des raisons pourquoi j'aime pas les sports d'√©quipe. 
Trop souvent, y'a une mentalit√© de quasi-fanatisme qui s'y rattache et que je trouve tr√®s moche.
Anyway, j'ai pas dit √ßa pour chier sur le hockey (ce que je n'ai d'ailleurs pas fait), j'ai juste dit que malgr√© le fait que je ne m'int√©resse pas √† cette discipline, je suis quand m√™me capable d'appr√©cier √† quel point cette photo est repr√©sentative de notre ville.
Apr√®s √ßa, si tu d√©cides d'y voir une attaque sur ta personne, ben c'est ton probl√®me.
Proud that there's not so much anti homeless benches.... There are some of course but not the majority
Lots of those were made with Ash cut in the last years all around the city. Trees had to be cut because of the Emerald ash borer disease.
I recently just moved to Montreal from the prairies and I have to say I honestly love the number of outdoor public spaces/benches this city has.
This is the kind of quality content I come to this subreddit for.
Pour les int√©ress√©s, le banc de la premi√®re photo a √©t√© concu par le studio de design montr√©alais [Dikini](http://studiodikini.com/#/collection-mtl/)
I‚Äôm in Toronto for the week and expected to have a place to sit and eat my takeout so I relate to this post very much, and the good seething only available on Montr√©al.
Happy to see that at least most aren't hostile architecture
It‚Äôs depressing being American, because any time I see a bench with someone in the middle (table or rail in these pictures), I think, the only reason that‚Äôs there is to stop homeless people from sleeping on them.
The one thing the pandemic has done has increased the number of nice places to sit in this city. I adore the little kiosk things set up on Wellington in Verdun, for instance. Summer seating in a box, outdoor dining... what's not to like.
Where is the first bench from? Haven't seen That one before!
It is nice, but I can see they've gone with the anti Human design by putting a table in the middle to ensure that a homeless person can't get a rest on it.
Des photos de banc = Relaxation Immediate
These kinds of things make me happy because the state of street furniture in many other Canadian cities is atrocious. Like [these new benches](https://twitter.com/JohnLorinc/status/1431219856213516288) in Toronto, for example.
I know some people think that unless we install literal beds\* in our streets everything is "anti-homeless" but all but a few of the benches in this slideshow are examples of interesting, highly functional and comfortable street furniture that do not have any hostile design qualities. And they don't even scratch the surface of the diversity of street furniture available in Montreal.
\*Incidentally in many parks there are [benches like these ones](https://goo.gl/maps/JUvQEA3x38AnCPwA7) that are pretty close to actual fucking beds.
Public cigarette rolling table
Ah yes benches, technology has gone so far in recent decades
We don't fully appreciate  our city,I fear
Beautiful work. If that was in Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps would have removed it by now because the varnish was offensive
the fact that i've sat in most of those chairs haha Montreal public seating is actually pretty top tier!
Can‚Äôt wait to visit again once borders are freely open for travelers. What a great city! I still remember my first poutine and beaver‚Äôs tail from eons ago.
Merci MONTR√âAL as well back to the US after a week, you‚Äôll be missed!
[deleted]
On dirait c'est fait pour que les sans abris puissent pas dormir..
1 et 4 ont l'air plus de banc anti-itin√©rants, bancs qu'un itin√©rant ne peu rester dessus confortablement pour une longue p√©riode de temps, que plusieurs villes utilisent (mais qui r√®gle pas le probl√®me)
Enjoy it while it's still clean
Its just benches bro chill tf out
Isn't this table just a way to deter homeless people from sleeping on the bench? 
Ps. I agree it's beautiful, but I've seen some crazy anti-homeless shit in my time
[deleted]
Ah yes, benches that prevent poor people from distracting tourists from our beautiful city.
They just have to buy a house like everyone else!
/s
Montreal is a mob run cesspool.
That beauty is lipstick thin.
Have you noticed how most of thoses benches are designed to prevent people from sleeping on them?
Yup have to agree with you. As much as I complain about  Mtl;  this, I give them Kudos. Some cities are real d\*\*ks.
There's definitely been more of them popping up over the years.
Yeah only a couple had the measures on there I was expecting more, genuinely happy. Not perfect, but a start
Semantics alert, the word disease is reserved for fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens. You can say EAB infestation but the damage it causes isn't a disease, it's simply the larvae chewing through the sapwood.
Yess whenever I visit Montreal, I‚Äôve gotta admit it‚Äôs pretty lively compared to Alberta
C'est parce que nous sommes gens de parole. And we also take pleasure in small talk. Last year I was in a more Anglo-Saxon part of the city, and they had individual seats not facing each other!
BENCH!
lol dikini
We don‚Äôt seethe at Torontonians anymore ‚Ä¶much
;)
Those tables ones are put in front of restaurants. I would say that it's pretty useful.
Saint-Laurent/Fairmount je pense
Pretty sure it‚Äôs [these ones on Fairmount](https://goo.gl/maps/SCU8fGAFmudUp2GS9)
Bench number 1 is actually next to a restaurant so during the lockdown  (and still now) it was quite nice to be able to sit outside and put your food on the table. At least the table serves a purpose and it's not just a random division?
13 of 14 examples here have no impediment to laying down. The other one's obstruction is a useful table for food or a coffee. Looks good to me.
Yeah because a table is totally useless except to prevent homeless people from sleeping. 
Seriously, of the many benches in this slideshow, the only one with a hostile design feature is the bench at the Old Point with a bar in the middle, and that's a space controlled by the federal government, not the city.
3 out of 14, what's your point?
Have you noticed that benches are designed for people to sit on them? I understand the whole ‚Äúthe city hates the homeless‚Äù vibe, but why sacrifice sitting features (why the bench was designed and put there) for sleepability?
I mean we're also allowed to use benches as benches and shouldn't forbid ourselves from tasteful designs because of homelessness considering we collectively fund attempts to solve the problem of homelessness.
That table appears to be multi functional and looks like it would make laying down a challenge.
Vancouver checking in. I don't remember the last time I saw a bench that didn't have bars running across the seats.
Wow! That's amazing work!
Beautiful painting !
Available for sell?
Great job Pavel!
You‚Äôre very talented! Keep it up this is amazing
Beautiful! 
is it oil on canvas?
Superbe! La v√©g√©tation tout particuli√®rement.
Do you sell your art in local markets?
Love it. Cinder blocks are a nice touch.
Iconic.
Very nice Job!
This is so beautiful !
Can I buy this?
Fabulous work! Although I always wondered why a lot of posts here consider this building iconic? I get that it is easily seen by everybody and it's pretty flashy, but is there anhthing else? Does it have some interesting history?
Do more.  Do more.
Awesome, Pavel. This is really different from the things I remember you drawing in Mrs. Fanning's class in 6th grade :D
C'est vraiment bien fait! Congrats! üëç
I like it also, I would be interested in buying it.  thanks
Wow, are you ever good.
Amazing job!  You have so much talent üé®üëåüèº
This is very good work! Love your style! Hope to see more of some Montreal paintings.  It is such a beautiful city!  I live in Alberta (born and raised in Montreal) and I still love doing Montreal sites!
Bravo!!!
It really captures the feel of seeing it! I'm a Montreal native but have been in exile for almost 20 years now, so love seeing stuff like this!
Amazing. Why don‚Äôt you sell it in bidgala
Wow; great job!
Outstanding jobüëå
Whoa! Your stuff should be in a gallery.
good job!
Amazing!
Incredible!! Would love to buy a print of this!
What does something like this sell for by curiosity? Beautiful painting!
üåπüåπüåπüåπüåπ
I agree with poop break philosopher
Thanks so much!
Thank you!
Sure, I will DM you.
Thanks alex! Alex was next to me making an inking drawing as I did this
Thank you! I wont ever stop
Yes, it is oil on linen. Oil is superior as it allows me to add some 3d strokes here and there
No, I don't, Montreal doesn't have a strong demand for the type of art I do. My stuff can be gotten from my website www.pavelsokov.com or print shop: https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/pavelsokov/
I think it is better to sell prints on global markets with Internet e-commerce. It can reach more people.
Thanks so much!
Thanks!
Thanks!
Thank you!
possibly, it might be taken already, not confirmed. Il dm you the price
It‚Äôs a great question. I really don‚Äôt like this building myself so I‚Äôm curious
I've always seen it as an easy way to get karma on this sub. a simple picture of the Five Roses building wouldn't get as many upvotes anywhere else. It's not really an important landmark in Montreal, even though the tourism/souvenir industry has tried really hard to make it into one to sell cheap tat. I think the pictures are lazy karmabait and that the subject is lame, but this is high effort and well executed, so props to OP!
There is a lot of very interesting history behind 5 Roses but I probably would butcher the history, here is a neat page that gives some insight: [https://montreall.com/farine-five-roses-how-one-sign-came-to-represent-our-city/](https://montreall.com/farine-five-roses-how-one-sign-came-to-represent-our-city/)
E: Got this great quote that explains it for some people:
"Represents childhood and coming home"

always and forever
Oh man, you have a good memory! how have you been?
(Its Gaby btw)
Wow, this one took a while. I've been off and on this model since before the world ended last year. Mostly off, because  *holy crap this one was hard*. Figuring out the math for the dual layer chiral dome took about 3 months alone. Assembly was an equal challenge. I am so happy to be done with this one, I really feel like I put my heart into it. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do. And if you don't like it, just say hi to my dog then. Lol, the forced perspective in the first photo makes me look like a child. The dome is about 60cm across in any direction.
Look forward to each of your posts. Amazing work.
If I was a game studio I'd hire you
Wow so cool!
What‚Äôs funny is that the Biosphere as most of us know it, is already the remains of the Biosphere
Can't believe St-Hubert is still around at this point.
So cool. Gives me some creepy Jurassic park vibes haha.
Gaslands fuck yeah. Love the St-Hub cars too, wtf that's a cool idea!
You are my local r/TerrainBuilding hero.
I take comfort in the knowledge that even in the Mad Max future apocalypse, I can still get a Quart Poitrine delivered!
Incredible! Would you ever exhibit these pieces?
nice work , even better dog
Amazing work!! üëè
Not bad at all , I would love to see an aftermath of the metro after a nuclear explosion , fallout style .
Wow. I‚Äôd buy these just to play 40K. The emperor protects‚Ä¶ even in Montreal!
Really love how you incorporated the modded St-Hubert delivery cars - really adds to the density of the whole piece. Cheers.
Dude this is fucking amazing nice job!
Very cool my dude!
Uh, you mean the Blood Dome?
Do you 3D print these? Love your process and wonder what materials you use!
Kudos!
I am sure there are plenty!  You have a gift AND you put in loads of work. 
Can someone from the art world chime in please?
Really dope man! You‚Äôre a trooper for sticking with it, you must be proud sitting back and looking at it. Keep it up, will be checking your profile in the future for more!
Very nice model of the USA Pavillion.
Oh, man, i absolutely *love* your work! This is amazing!!
Are you the same guy who did a miniature Five Roses? And do you have an Instagram where we can follow you because that‚Äôs so cool!
such coolstuff really. Dependinh what arrondissement you live in, contact the cultural centre or something! Or maybe Place des Arts? or whoever was in charge of the art installations in the 'underground city' or during Nuit Blanche.
Like someone said before, a metro station would be hella cool. I'd also like to throw in a suggestion for Chinatown ;) or one of the major bridges.
Doggo seems like such a good boi, not jumping on your art :)
Looking forward to your future projects!
I'm a simple man, I see Gaslands I upvote.
You do very nice work!  I was in the biosphere in 1967.  Awesome place:)
Amazing
You should make the Olympic stadium a city
Do you have Instagram?
You wanna ride in Valhalla with the Immortan Joe?!
doggo depressed looking at it lol
Your dog is so cute!
And the model is very cool :)
This series would be a perfect fit for the McCord Museum! After you're done playing with them, of course :)
great work...
Where is the racing track near by, brother? :)
lol, I wrote a short story that took place in a post apocalyptic MTL. It won the 9th grade McIntyre.
Very cool!
Awesome work as always! Do you post these anywhere else (an Instagram page, for example?) or just on Reddit? Would love to share your work with others, but having them all in one place would be easier than a bunch of Reddit links.
edit: nevermind, saw your post further down. Will follow you!
Can you make a landmark of the Canadian Tire de Fabreville ? As seen on Tetes a Claques back in the day ? Maybe add some aliens in there as well !!!
Man if there is ever a post-apocalypse series set in Montreal everything has fallen apart but the rickety-ass bridges are still standing
great work, maybe the champlain next lol
C'est une bonne id√©e
Allez-vous le vendre ou l'afficher?
Great work! Love the shades..
Saw your Mateo in another post. I had to see your biosphere. Wow.
So cool! Old Champlain next?
Great and awesome job! Do you have an ig?
Quite [smashing](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3b8d8q/absolutely_surreal_the_montreal_biosphere_on_fire), good chap
Oh wow, thanks!
Me too. They're always really cool!
Hire me anyway? I need work, dog.
Probablement l'une des plus belle rue de Montr√©al.
√Ä l'√©poque de la construction de la tour qu'on voit dans le fond (Altoria), on √©tait ben enthousiaste √† Montr√©al, pour les fans de gratte-ciel. Du 120 m√®tres! 
Maintenant, je regrette un brin qu'on a pas quelque chose de plus imposant et se d√©marquant pour souligner cette perspective. On construit maintenant des tours de 200 m√®tres plus int√©ressantes.
Super photo merci :).
Montreal a seulement besoin qu'on enl√®ve les cones oranges et les sacs de poubelles d√©chir√©s sur le bord des rues pour √™tre belle, mais ca arrive pas souvent.
Seulement nos rues.
Cette rue a fait l‚Äôobjet de beaucoup d‚Äôam√©liorations dans les 20 derni√®res ann√©es. Finalement, c‚Äôest beau. 
Malheureusement, on laisse toujours d√©p√©rir les rues avant d‚Äôen prendre soin.
Une belle immense craque dans la rue. Typical Montreal
Pas un c√¥ne en vue... superbe...
My work building is in this picture and I'm getting nostalgic.
It's dumb, but I miss it. (it's under renovations right now, so I can't go even if I needed/wanted to)
To√© t'as pas besoin d'filter pour bien para√Ætre
Je sais que je suis en retard, mais t'as tu vol√© le post d'un gars y'a un an ? https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/cqq25w/apr√®s_34_bi√®res_une_photo_au_milieu_de_la_rue/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
wow its beautiful with the sunset fading \^\_\^
(With the detours all over the place) I found myself driving through there last night, and the street and buildings were striking.  I haven't been in years (decades?) and I was noticing the detail in the stonework for the first time.  Truly a jewel.
C‚Äôest cens√© donner envie? Haha
Ils sont o√π les c√¥nes orange, les No Parking et les d√©tours? Je trouve que √ßa plut√¥t l'air d'une science fiction.
Beautiful city.
Vraiment belle la photo! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Montr√©al is so beautiful yes, mais je ne peut plus y habiter. Trop de monde, trop ch√®re, le prix des logements √† louer est devenu fou, pu capable.
I used to live right on the left of that picture - 110 rue McGill. What an incredible loft. This was 15 years ago, though, and the neighbourhood was pretty deserted after 5pm on weekdays.
Years later I read some article in the paper that mentioned there was a really bad AirBnB problem with a unit on the street over (des Soeurs-Grises) that had parties going several times a week, and I would have been able to see & hear all of that. Kinda glad I got out before that became a problem.
Still miss that loft, though.
Ok maintenant post une photo station McGill √† 1h15 am avant la covid et sans filtre.
Pi pourtant... environ 98% des b√¢timents qui font de Montr√©al, "Montr√©al", c'est tous des b√¢timents qui sont en fkn briques, mias avec une belle fausse facade adapt√© selon les go√ªts du moment o√π ils ont √©t√© faites. 
&#x200B;
erh.
my uni ‚ù§Ô∏è
Sooo sad...
Yup! Vieux Montreal/Vieux Port, toujours des belles vues.
La rue Saint-Paul dans le boute de la Place Jacques-Cartier est pas pire non plus. 
Mon opinion : ce tron√ßon de rue Saint-Paul devrait √™tre strictement pi√©tonni√®re
on pourrait faire comme Philadelphie et avoir 2 ou 4 tour plus haute
Tout comme les Rocabellas occupent des terrains strat√©giques pour du 200m mais elles n'ont aucun attrait architectural.
Enlever les cones oranges?
Contrairement √† ma face :(
L'asphalte sa craque avec le gel/d√©gel. Et cette craque la c'est juste la jonction entre les deux moiti√©s de chauss√© qui se rejoignent. Chialer pour chialer

Les briques rouges de Montr√©al sont jolies.
La rue McGill a quelque chose de plus. Bordant le quartier International et le Vieux-Montr√©al, il y a une mixit√© d'architectures tr√®s impressionnante, puis la rue est assez large et les b√¢timent sont tr√®s bien √©clair√©s.
Ah oui, tellement d‚Äôaccord!
Ou bien on pourrait faire comme Paris ou Rome et arr√™ter de penser qu'il faut plein de tours pour √™tre cool.
La plus belle de ce lot, c'est d√©finitivement l'Avenue, mais on ne la voit pratiquement pas malgr√© ses plus ou moins 180 m√®tres!
:( 
It's okay bud (o¬¥ÔΩ•_ÔΩ•)„Å£
√áa ne change pas mon commentaire... typical Montreal [√† cause du gel/degel]
Ou m√™me les villes mill√©naires. Les Romains plaquaient ben des fa√ßades avec un petit rev√™tement en marbre ;).
Le quartier de La D√©fense √† Paris √† pas mal plus de tours qu‚Äôau centre-ville de Montr√©al.
ce qui pourrait √™tre cool c‚Äôest avoir de la qualit√© et non de la quantit√©
J'ai toujours trouv√© qu'elle ressemble √† un troph√© !
Le Longueuil de Paris.
Est-ce que t'as pris le temps d'aller visiter cet endroit ? Pas moi. Ils ont mis √ßa loin √† c√¥t√© parce qu'ils ne voulaient pas enlaidir la ville comme ils ont fait avec la tour Montparnasse.
Moi j'ai pris le temps de le visiter et je peux te dire que c'est un quartier super int√©ressant. En metro √ßa ce fait super vite et marcher autour de la d√©fense et monter en haut de l'observatoire √©tait une bonne exp√©rience. Il y a de beaux b√¢timents en construction en en planification en plus, √ßa deviendra encore plus beau.
Farine = french; five = english; roses = bilingual. Perfect montreal.
Pas mal plus beau sur ton dessin que dans la vraie vie üòÇ
Great work! 
Coincidentally, it seems I sat on a neighbouring bench and [sketched nearly the same view](https://i.imgur.com/DCPAAFM.jpeg) almost exactly 10 years ago (my notes just say early June 2011).
Out of curiosity, are the white areas gouache, or opaque markers?

Magnifique!
Great piece. The water is impressive. ‚ù§
Once again I see something like this and feel the need to expand my horizons and learn how to draw and capture life through my hand.

Thanks for the Posca info. I'll check them out.
I would not be surprised if this was either done criminally,  or for insurance fraud. Holy hell...220 trees cut down for this.

Huh, what's a 20M$ for the pornhub CEO anyway? The real loss were these 220 trees cut off because of all this trashy dirty money mansion builkding #karma
Shit, I passed by the place yesterday afternoon.
I hope the fire didn't dammage any of the surrounding houses.
What a bloody waste of resources.
Good thing it didn't happen during a dry spell. Sparks could have set Bois de Saraguay, across the street, alight. That would have been a real disaster.
Having working for Mindgeek for a number of years, all I can is good. Fuck this guy.
come si dice ARSON
The original founders live under private security protection because they pissed off the American mafia by running tube sites like PornHub (free, stolen, exclusive content) while doing exclusive content for Brazzers and pretending to fight against it.
They sold because their lives were in danger. I guess the mob has a long memory because Antoon is the brother in law of one of the original owners.
I used to work there and heard it from an employee that was there as this was all happening.
And nothing of value was lost....
I guess people got tired of that guy stealing land and knocking down trees for his monument to excess.
Je serais port√© √† dire que c'est un coup de vengeance de la part d'une victime et non le propri√©taire qui essaie de faire son argent sur les assurances.
What a complete waste of resources. Money laundering and insurance fraud at their finest I guess.
Not an easy house to sell ...
√áa me rappelle le building √† c√¥t√© de ma job sur Wellington qui √©tait abandonn√© depuis plusieurs ann√©es. Un jour un promoteur a voulu faire des condos et 2 and plus tard, √† cause du prix exorbitant √† cause qu'il devait garder les murs pour le patrimoine, un feu magique d√©truisit le building. Le lendemain matin les bulldozers commen√ßaient √† faire les fondations.
Probablement qu'il veut se construire une nouvelle mansion au frais de l'assureur. En plus, elle n'√©tait pas √† vendre? Curieux de quelqu'un qui voudrait se vanger d'y mettre le feu...
Lol I blame the media for always talking about that mansion linked to Pornhub's recent scandal, what a waste.
Definitely torched it.

I live on toupin and my parents told me they thought it was one of the apartment buildings, that‚Äôs crazy how I talked about this house with them recently
he‚Äôll make it back in no time
It might be worth 20M. It might take 4-5M to build though.
He got organized crime problems? Or is this blatant fraud?
they saw two people break into the house...
yeah, doesn't sound suspicious!
So...
Two man savagely forcing their way into this young house only to leave burning marks?
It went for Sale Friday.
Last nite it was torched.
Save the porn!
Oh I randomly found that house and was amazed at the size. Just walking in a random park and BAM super crazy massive house.
If you thought pornhubs content was hot, you should see the owners house

Hi! Yes I do.
Tks so much! Selling prints and Giclee's.
Just read a similar post over on r/Ottawa. Restaurant owners complain of not having staff but when people apply, they expect 40 hours of available time with no guarantee of work, years of experience and availability during Christmas and the summer.
I work at a Pharmaprix, they are hiring new people at 14-15$ per hour and yet they refuse to match the wages of people who worked there for years to that same amount, so people are just quitting.
[deleted]
I remember going to the mall with 20 cvs at a time to hand out in every store and fast food place in the hopes that someone would give me a $6/hour job. I'm so glad that people don't have to do that now. We were treated like total crap and we had to put up with it.
I've been at this a long time and I'm going to throw a little insight out there. The restaurant industry is a bit of a hellscape for everyone right now.
&nbsp;
The owners: The price of everything went up, food, labour, utilities. Hell even the price of rags have almost doubled. In an industry where margins were already razor thin this is pretty disastrous. 30$-50$ for a main course in a decent restaurant is unfortunately just what things cost now. The crazy rise in prices on the menus isn't the owner getting richer, it's just covering rising costs.
&nbsp;
Service staff: This was already a rough job, then the pandemic started and it only got harder. The kind of people who kept going out at the beginning of the pandemic were exactly the kind of people you'd figure wouldn't be apprehensive about going out with a new virus raging through the world. It's gotten better but there has definitely been a bit of a shift in the general attitude of the clients. On top of this there's new rules to follow, extra cleaning to do, masks to wear and passports to check. 
&nbsp;
Kitchen staff: Same as service, it was already a rough job. During the pandemic it only got harder. How do you taste things while wearing a mask? Kitchens can already be unbearably hot and sweaty, add in masks (and for a little while visors) and nobody is having fun. The pay for working in a kitchen has always been shit as well. The average hourly salary for a server in the places I'm involved in was 35$, for cooks it's 17$, dishwashers 15$. A debate about salary inequality is a deep dive and a discussion all on it's own but there's a big disparity and that disparity is a driving factor.

Overall: I don't know anyone in the industry that is still on the PCU. However I know a lot of "lifers" from both the service and kitchen that have left the industry and are never coming back. People who have been working all their life in the industry had time to look and realize that there are many jobs that offer a better work/life balance. For the kitchen side a lot of these jobs pay a lot better too. The people leaving tend to be the most experienced, I keep in contact with a lot of them hoping to scoop them up if they ever come back, after 6 months to a year of working outside the industry there's not a single one that has.
cost of living too expensive now to be working a minimum wage job
Le comptoir Tim Hortons √† c√¥t√© de chez nous ferme de 4PM √† 5AM maintenant. Tant mieux! Moins de d√©chets dans ma ruelle!
Je me rappelle avoir du passer une entrevue pour travailler au Premiere Moisson! Dans un magasin qui vendait des trucs de F1 au vieux-port, le gars m'a fait passer une entrevue de fond sur les √©curies, les pilotes etc.. avant de me dire que √ßa marcherait pas parce que j'avais "l'air trop intellectuel" et pas d'exp√©rience en inventaire.. 
 J'espere que le mouvement va se r√©pendre aux autres industries et permettre aux travailleurs de n√©gocier un meilleur salaire ou equilibre travail/famille...
I see signs up like this occasionally and it baffles me how they expect to pay someone minimum wage and they want you to be available 24/7 regardless of anything else. You want me available 24/7, then pay me for 24/7. Don‚Äôt like it then too bad lol.

I have 0 sympathy for them
When I was looking for my first job, I probably gave about 50-70 CVs. I went to McDonald's "Hire day" 4 times and they refused me 3 times and finally accepted the fourth time. Getting that first job was awesome but wasn't easy at all. When I left the job a couple months ago, they begged me to stay because they were losing too much staff. The way they were treating staff was absolute garbage. They would scream at people and make 15 years old cry because they weren't fast/good enough. If you want a toxic environment to work at, McDonald's is the place to go. 
Look at them now, begging for more employees, doing "Hire day" literally EVERY WEEK for the past 5 months. Yea, fuck you.
I know many small business (including resto) owners and I have no sympathy for them regarding this issue.
If your business model cannot sustain living wages for your employees you simply should not be in operation. If your economic sector won't allow you to operate any other way then the government needs to bud in. This won't happen until there is a real crisis in the sector.
That bullshit view that retail jobs should not pay enough to sustain someone has got to go.
Minimum wages should be raised so that someone working full time can live decently. (i.e. decent foods, shelter, clothing, healthcare and education).
The real shortage is livable wages not staff!
Same situation in the USA. McDonalds and other fastfood places are closing at like 7-8 Pm where I live. Places are all out of items on the menu.... 
But you know what? This isn't the worst thing in the world. We need to roll back a little bit imo. There's absolutely no reason to have all of these 24/7 places like we do in the USA. Maybe we don't need these places opened every day.
The restaurant industry is hard work. People should be compensated for their work. It's a lot harder than sitting in my pajamas all day on a computer.
Hopefully restaurants start paying proper wages to their employees AND we eliminate tipping.
I went to gaspesie recently and mcdonald on my way there were hiring with starter salaries of 18$/h full time ... they sell less but can pay more ? Doesn't make sense to me, seem like Montr√©al franchise are just being greedy fucks.
Off topic but I love how ‚Äúhow the turntables‚Äù is now just being used unironically
Same couldnt get a dead end job to save my life, even when i graduated college the first time (went back to uni after 2 years of working below poverty level in my field). Im pretty sure if i lost my  "good"job now tho the fast food place would still reject me and be like we cant find anyone!!!!
If they treated people better then they do/did, then they wouldn't have issues. Do not treat staff like shit, we talk and we know who is good people and who isn't.
I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs not just the government checks. I have never worked in the front lines before, and I imagine it doesn‚Äôt pay enough so on your weekends you‚Äôre busy managing your life and pinching pennies, no time to reassess. So now that service employees had down time, they realize they want to do something else, or have more value. Not the best comparison, but when people are in a bad relationship, it‚Äôs this cycle of low self esteem that‚Äôs hard to get out of and it lasts for years. But once you‚Äôre out, you suddenly have higher standards.
We‚Äôll see what happens when the subsidies stop
One of the solution to this problem is to have more of those restaurents that only serve 2 or 3 types of very good and specialized food. Places where the owner (usually the cook) and 1 or 2 more employees can make it work. Small, highly specialized and efficient. Forget about fancy service aux tables and 20 different items in the menu. 
Same should happen to retail. No more huge Wall Mart where you need to underpay tones of people to make it work. More smaller, curated and specialized shops that can be maintained by owner and a few people only. Anyway, big retail shops will all be killed by Amazon so they better find a more human way for people to shop than to go in power centers.
Those types of places are very common in countries like Japan and makes for very lively, walkable and inviting neighborhoods. 
Small and curated.
Fast-food restaurants have historically always been hiring whoever postulates.
They have some of the highest turnaround numbers of any industry.
Im surprised none of them wanted to hire you..
Don't disparage kitchen workers because you have a grudge against owners. Working in the kitchen doesn't require any education, but it's not easy work. It's fast paced, you're on your feet all day, you're in a small room with many other people, and kitchens are really damn hot workspaces.
On the bright side vu la competition c‚Äôest drette le bon temps pour n√©gocier une augmentation ou changer de compagnie, j‚Äôai d√©cid√©e de faire √ßa et j‚Äôai eu une augmentation de 15% en switchant de compagnie +assurances et job syndiqu√© ce que j‚Äôavais pas avant.
Literally the same. I was dead broke and used to beg my parents for money and they kept saying find a job. I literally gave my CV to every single resto chain (McDo, tims) and none of them called back. I used to get hella sad thinking there‚Äôs something wrong with me and why no one would hire. Now that they‚Äôre all begging for employees and I have my own business, I literally laugh out loud (LOL) at them
Well thankfully the world is changing. Even mom and pop stores could have the money to pay better wages - it shouldn't be their employees faults if their employers don't have any business acumen. I mean its great that you scraped enough money together to start something and I totally support that but just in the same way you budget to say buy product, market, rent a store front, you should budget to pay a fair wage.
Young and older people who both likewise might work smaller income jobs are starting to stand up for themselves and let it be done that they won't settle for wages that neither reflect accurately the difficulty of the work, their value as employees, or the cost of living.
Yeah, the owner of the restaurant in my office building was complaining last week about how nobody wants to work because they're getting benefits from the federal government, and it's killing him, because he's working 12 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Over the weekend, I found out they're closing on Mondays from now on.  
Huh.  Maybe it wasn't worth the effort to remain open on Mondays, because they weren't earning enough to cover their costs...
Big businesses prefer to scorch the earth over paying a living wage, despite the fact that there's virtually no such thing as unskilled jobs, I've worked in academia the last 3-4 years and my time as a barista in an understaffed restaurant was way harder than this, they only want bullshit reasons to justify precarious wages. At least I can brew exquisite coffee I guess...
Exactly how I feel. I worked for a pretty busy restaurant in the Plateau, and because I desperately needed money for school, I put up with very long shifts and very short breaks (15 mins break for an almost 10 hours shift.) They ended up telling me I wasn‚Äôt efficient enough and I just quit after that. Now they have to close for a day every week because they‚Äôre short staffed. Oh well!
[https://www.coastreporter.net/amp/local-news/volunteers-give-their-time-to-short-staffed-eateries-4217398](https://www.coastreporter.net/amp/local-news/volunteers-give-their-time-to-short-staffed-eateries-4217398) this happened in BC and i truly hate it
I know, when I want to edge, I go check the signs begging for employees on the local restaurants or any struggling customer service place. As a former customer service employee, it's the most satisfying thing in the world. Power to the working class
Maybe there wouldn't be a shortage of staff if they just paid decent wages. Who knows, maybe once 2022 starts and the minimum wage is raised to $15 people will start wanting to work in minimum wage jobs again.
I think we the people should continue with this and turn it into a movement. We deserve better pay, better treatment, and better wages.
I once got fired from KFC because I wasn't good enough for their standards. (I was making chicken nuggets and fries)
Today I'm a wealth manager making 6 figures.
Never give up
The answer is easy. Pay more. It so fucking stupid simple. People want to work for you if you pay a good wage. Crazy right?
I'm leaving my current employer who's paying employee hiring bonuses for another employer who's paying double the starting salary I'm getting after 5 years of work. I've also noticed how language is no longer the barrier it used to be.
Lol I find it funny because the service industry just cut loose all those people without a second thought, and Wow! No one wants to come back because there is still the looming threat of being cut loose! How bizarre!! Treat people as disposable, and they'll find other work.
I think you misspelled "cheer"
It‚Äôs crazy to think that this wasn‚Äôt long ago. I vividly remember dropping CVs at so many of these places and getting rejected by almost all of them. I don‚Äôt feel too bad for them. Does anyone know if smaller businesses are being affected as much from the worker shortage?
Working at Tim Hortons sucks, a lot of stores in my area are all scrambling for employees doing absolutely nothing to increase the abysmal quality of working for them.
Il y a 4 fois trop de restos/caf√©s/microbrasseries √† Montr√©al. La crise √©conomique qui s'en vient va faire le m√©nage l√†-dedans.
I wonder what s the solution for these big chains.. it s not like there s an obvious solution or anything......... if only there was an easy answer that has proven effective..... hmmmmmmm
There is nothing good that comes from a customer service job, especially at minimum wage. Putting aside employers cheating time and money out of their workers, just having to deal with bad clientele is too much for such a low wage. And people have gotten SO much worse during the pandemic. The emotional toll of customer service is honestly just not worth it
But we totally need immigration to deal with this labour "shortage"!
/s
The mom and pop restaurants and cafes underpay their staff just the same. Some may say it's because they can't afford to pay their staff more. My response to that is simple: declare bankruptcy and move on. This is the way of the world. Same for any other business.
Been in the industry for 10 years. The worst pay I've ever had was at the best establishments in our city(fine dining) that are not chains. I don't really feel for any of them. It's time for a change.
Let them close until they give people better pay üí™
I have absolutely no sympathy for these restaurant chains.  If you can't afford to pay your employees a decent wage, then you should simply close.  Exploiting your employees so you can stay in business is a terrible business model.  This is what happen during this pandemic.  The exploited workers simply found another job.
I do feel back for the small family restaurants.  I hope they survive the pandemic.
That and firing staff for covid passports. Lol begging and choosing, all at the same time.
I remember back in the early 2000's when applying for my first job at 15, I handed out so many resumes and each place made mention of my lack of experience,  cause ya know, I was 15 - but then I went into Super Pet (taken over by Pet Smart since) and I went to customer service. The gal behind the counter took my resume and said "you've never had a job before?" And I looked at her and said "no, but I'm hoping someone will give me a chance." I got a call later that day and worked there until I graduated high-school. It was a great job, and I'm always grateful that Jackie took a chance on me.
Absolutely elite setup
I worked from my balcony most of last summer. 2 monitors even. A bunch of my neighbours were doing remote meetings from their own balconies. One guy is a reporter and used to shoot the news from his balcony or sidewalk sometimes too!  Getting to know my neighbours better was one good thing that came out of the pandemic for me.
By the end of the summer he has a gamer chair, minifridge, a short throw projector and some led strips all over the edge of that balcony.

Also a picture of the world's most useless sign.  Have you ever seen a cyclist give a fuck about a one-way sign?

She's using 100% of her brain

[deleted]
They're saying that, since the cyclists will ignore the one-way sign anyway, it's a waste of money and signage to add a sign explicitly granting them permission to do so. I'm not sure whether or not I agree, but it's definitely a position that makes sense.
Yes, thank you.
Looks like there's a delay on the orange line. I made this in about 6 days, not counting the time I took last year to model out the metro cars. Couldn't find any blueprints for the MR-63 cars, but the NS-74 cars from Santiago are pretty darn close I think. Made with garbage, foam, hot glue, and a 4k resolution 3D printer. This is probably going to be my last model for a while; I'm not making any money doing this, and the tax man says I owe him for all that EI money last year, so I gotta go back to a real job. This project was so much fucking fun to do, I really hope you all like it too! If you want to see the in progress pictures, and all of my previously destroyed landmarks, you can check out my Instagram, @apocalypse_montreal.
that looks like it could be a cake! nice job!
[deleted]
So what do you do with them once done? Hope they are on display in your place or something
Please make Hall Building, or any other Concordia Uni building. No reason why.
Fallout 67
I've always felt that Namur was one in the more apocalyptic metros to begin with. Great work!
respect
Nice dude, you should pop in some small battery powered LED's in there to add effect. It'd be relatively cheap / easy thing to learn that would really add to these projects.
Nice miniature model man! Really goes into detail. Also, this model reminds me of Z‚ÄôIsle for some reason (comic-book series about a post zombie-apocalyptic Montreal).
You should do some buildings from McGill! Your work is amazing
Qu'es-ce que tu veux dire par Post-apocalyptic...look close to what metro station look like :p
Nicely done! But "post apocalyptic"? With the state of our bridges, I don't think we need an apocalypse for this! üòâ
This is pretty cool
Amazing! As long as there‚Äôs no consequences to the green line, I‚Äôm cool with this üòé
What is the second floor on that station used for? It wasn't always there and it has a fancy security gate.
i work right near this lol
B Movie time: Escape from NY III: Northern Lights
WOW!! You came up with it quickly !!! Really nice !!
You are so good at these. I had an idea where you could do one of the rollercoasters at laronde.
"His neighbors described the suspect as a quiet man that kept to himself. They would have never thought of the shocking displays of violence and destruction found by the police in the suspects' appartment."
I like the arcade machine btw. Did you build that one aswell?  
Ouh! a Post apocalyptic working arcade machine..... that sounds like a fun project....
Plot twist: C‚Äôest un jour normal pour station Namur
Sick!!
I'd love to see the big O  post apocalyptic üëè good job on this one.
whats that cabinet behind ?
wanna have a few rounds of SF ? :o
I love all your models. Are you the guy playing Gaslands with those? I remember a long time ago seeing your (I think?) models here or on some other small model making sub.
A lot of those props would be fun for a Cyberpunk Red campaign too!
Next; Forum Pepsi
I love this. It's amazing!!
Resident Evil 9: Tabarnak
OP, I love this, you have a great talent. Looking forward to the next one.
/u/banano_tipbot 15
Haha I hope you do place des arts at some point and maybe hotel de ville
Thanks! Funny, I'm actually a trained pastry chef by trade. I approach these projects pretty similarly to how I'd approach a cake. Lots of skill transference, I think.
You don't have to wait, I already did it. Check my previous posts, or @apocalypse_montreal on insta.
They go on display in my apartment, I'm hoping to use them for tabletop gaming now that quarantine is over.
Thanks! I especially like the lights inside, with the truncated octohedron frames. So I exploded them out onto the sidewalk. :P
Thanks! I used that trick for my Gibeau Orange Julip model, I may go and add a similar effect to this one.
Thanks! I'm familiar with Z'Isle, the people behind it actually commissioned me to make their version of the Five Rose's sign last year.
My recommendation is that building on top of the hill that used to be an insane asylum, or the Mctavish Castle
I get that with a lot of my pieces. Montreal is already a post-apocalyptic town.
Lol, the challenge with this project is making things look more decrepit, busted, and forgotten than they've already become in real life. I've contended from the start of this project that Montreal is already in a post-apocalyptic state, we just got used to it.
It's Namur, you're missing like what, two stops? No biggie.
Secret CSIS office, I imagine.
I'd watch that.
Thanks! Yeah, I went whoosh whoosh on this one .
Thanks!
Thanks! Yeah, I probably got my own personal CSIS agent at this point. The arcade was my roommates quarantine project, he's got them hacked to play pretty much any pinball table or arcade game he wants.
In my head, this scene is on the 5 year anniversary of the explosion, and all the city did was throw up some cones and tell people to use the other sidewalk.
Thanks!
Lol, my biggest piece is the biosphere,  I'm not doing anything larger than that. Where the heck would I put it?
My roommate built an arcade with a cabinet and a couple pinball tables, we throw down on Street Fighter to see who does the dishes. :P
Thanks! Yeah, that sounds like me. And yeah, the plan is Gaslands and Cyberpunk Red once I cam can safely gather around a table again. So soon! Probably going to have to slow down on the models unless I get an actual commission piece, time to get back to my day job.
Val√©rie Plante Coderre 2: le Replantage
(commentaire que j'ai vue sur un autre tread)
Je me demande a quel point cette derni√®re semaine lui a fait mal avec sa transparence l√©gendaire.  Plus capable
As a wise man once said :
izi pizi
Denis c'est comme une grosse coquerelle. Pourrait y avoir une 3e guerre mondiale avec Montr√©al totalement d√©truite et irradi√©e, qu'il reviendrait quand m√™me essayer de nous crosser avec ses belles palettes blanches en disant: "Vous allez √™tre pogn√© avec moi!"
Quand est-ce qu'il annonce qu'il quitte la politique maintenant?
Denis retourne dans ton trou!!
Bon y va nous laisser tranquille Coderre l√† j'esp√®re.
Quel soulagement!
√áa me rappelle les mandats de Ferrandez dans le Plateau. √Ä chaque √©lection, la m√™me gang de bros vieux jeu annon√ßait qu'on allait enfin se d√©barasser du maire tant d√©test√©, mais au final il accroissait son avance.
Turns out les gens du plateau aimaient √ßa des rues pi√©tonni√®res et une baisse de la circulation sur les petites rues.
Mon gut feeling est que la m√™me gang de douche bros ont pris cette √©lection pour acquis, pour les m√™mes raisons.
Surtout heureux de voir un rejet aussi ressenti de la vision "hussle city" vieillot de Coderre.
M'en fous d'avoir plus de festivals, plus de corporate, plus de ci ou de √ßa qui ne fera rien dans ma vie de tout les jours. Je veux juste un milieu de vie montr√©alais vivable. Mon vote allais donc √† Plante, par d√©faut.
Quant √† Bala-blabla j'me souviens jamais de son nom... sa performance √©lectorale correspond pas mal √† mon estime de lui. Clown total.
It's a great night for women mayors in quebec in general!
Get fukt mayor Quimby
Denis 2.0 √©tait pareil comme avant, et donc le r√©sultat est le m√™me.
J'sais pas ce qui me fait le plus plaisir : La victoire et Plante ou la d√©faite de Coderre.
On est rendu √† presque 14% d'√©cart.
Il doit pas √™tre content le bonhomme.
Well at least they'll be quiet about the return of the expos boondoggle for another few years.
Bye Bye Coderre, bon d√©barras.
I got legit scared during this election but I'm gonna sleep well tonight.
Et plus forte que la derni√®re fois. Du moins √† 22h21.
L'√©quipe Coderre m'a appel√© pour une sondage la semaine pass√©e et je leur au r√©pondu que je ne voulais pas voter pour Plante, mais l√† j'avais pas le choix, parce que je n'√©tais pas pour peut √™tre faire r√©entrer la corruption a l'h√¥tel de ville.
Bye Denis! Reste chez vous la prochaine fois!
QUEL PLAISIR.
Meilleur moment de la soir√©e : les plans du party de Coderre vide a 20h.
More bicycle lanes lets gooooo
~~Wtf Rosemont avec Ensemble Montr√©al en avance ? Le monde ont pris pour acquis que le terrain √©tait assur√©, \*sigh\*.~~
Anyway, sayonara mon Coderre, t'iras √©couter le baseball aux states avec ton gros salaire de lobbyiste sale !
Lionel Perez √©lu dans CDN-NDG me laisse avec un petit gout de vomi dans la bouche...
Na na na na, na na na na, hey hey hey, goodbye!
YES!
Coderre 2.0 l‚Äôavait pr√©dit en s‚Äôappelant Coderre 2eme.
I‚Äôm quite happy that corrupt, arrogant buffoon didn‚Äôt get his old job back.
Osti j'suis tellement contente que Val√©rie soit r√©√©lue! Coderre pendant son discours: "tous les gens qui se pr√©sente pour la mairie sont vraiment courageux, j'aimerais qu'on les applaudissent" Si humble..
Bon d√©barras!
Qu‚Äôil decalisse pour toujours le Denis.
This means Coderre's finally gone for good, right?
Bye Feliciaaaaaaaa
pensez vous que Denis va redevenir transparent et ne plus √™tre visible dans l'actualit√© ?
Fuck le discours de Coderre m‚Äô√©nerve mais a un point.
TIL that this sub is very pro-Plante.
√áa va donner √† Coderre le temps d'√©crire un nouveau livre.
2 plant 2 furious!!
Michel C Auger: "(Coderre) doit la trouver dure".
Fuck away Denis, fuck away
Hopefully that corrupt POS never appears again.
Phew. Tr√®s tr√®s contente.
L'attitude d'Ensemble Montr√©al aupr√®s de certains de leur √©lu de par le fait de le montrer la porte juste par leur √¢ge est une bonne revanche avec leur pi√®tre r√©sultat.
Ce qui est d√©solant ce qu'est ces √©lus ce soir n'ont pas gagn√© et ils √©taient aux services de leur citoyen pendant bon nombre d'ann√©es l√† ils ont √©t√© remplac√© par des √©lu que nous savons pas r√©ellement qui elles sont et qui ont gagn√© juste par leur banni√®re √©tant li√© √† Ensemble Montr√©al.
C'est bien beau la mairie mais notre voix pour se faire entendre c'est nos √©lus locaux la plupart du temps.
CELEBRATION
It is done.
Coderre: Jai essay√© la exacte same game qui m'a perdu la mairie aux derni√®res √©lections et bizzarement, j'ai pas gagn√©!
Go to hell Coderre.
Finalement, tout le monde qui chialaient contre elle dans l'empire Quebecor n'habitent pas vraiment Montr√©al et ne font pas le poids face √† elle qui g√®re bien la ville pur ceux qui y vivent?!
Let the meme game begin
Pauvre gars. Tr√®s h√¢te de voir son discours de d√©faite.
Coderre 2025 /s
Sweet.
Genre thank fuck lmao

Le lipdub de l'UQAM est facilement la meilleure vid√©o produite au Qu√©bec et rien ne me fera changer d'avis.
J‚Äôen connais rien sur √ßa, tu peux tu partager la vid√©o stp?
Pour vrai? En m√™me temps y'aurait ben juste Villeneuve pour faire un lip dub scolaire qui se ramasse [plus de 11m de vues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zcOFN_VBVo) donc √ßa me semble tr√®s plausible.

The 'no right turn on red' and 'lots of one way streets' are common features of lots of cities in the eastern half of the continent. New York City has both while Chicago, Boston, and lots of smaller New England cities are full of one-ways but allow right turns on red except where posted (and in some places around Boston it's posted at like, every intersection). Agree on the jay-walking thing though, compared to NYC y'all are a bunch of rule-following nerds.
>Sidenote: I‚Äôve never seen people respect cross walks so religiously. No one J-walks.
That's definitely a post-COVID thing, because as a former downtown pedestrian, holy jay walking batman, it used to see it ALL the time.
There's a lot more archetypes you just haven't unlocked them yet
There are lots of cute old couples strolling around happily doing their errands BECAUSE there is no right on red. Relax at the red light and wait 30 seconds when you're in your car, then the rest of us can relax while we're crossing the road, and not have to worry you haven't seen us.
Glad you like it here. I've lived in the city since 1989 except for 7 years spent elsewhere--and all the time I was elsewhere I was thinking "wait, why don't I live in Montreal right now?"
Hey I wear a chest fannypack I feel seen.
>I've never seen people respect cross walks so religiously. No one J-walks. 
Lmao what?
je suis de l'Alberta, aussi anglo
1. en accord, je sais pas pourquoi le monde capote sur les bagels
2. d'apr√®s moi, les r√®gles ont du sens pour une grande ville... mais 100% d'accord, les montr√©alais sont ni mieux ni pire que les albertains ou les britanno-colombiens sur la route
3. haha

So just to comment on your side note about jay-walking: Montreal used to be notorious for its jay-walking, to the point that travelling to other Canadian cities people would look at you like you literally just died if you do it. Then about, idk, 6 or 7 years ago the city announced they decided to actually start enforcing jaywalking rules. Within the first week I was given two warnings by passing cops, I got the message as I'm sure many did because it just kinda stopped.
>I‚Äôve never seen people respect cross walks so religiously. No one J-walks.
I've been ticketed for jaywalking. I scan for cops before doing this now.

Thanks for this post. As a 30 year old Anglo-Montrealer, it was interesting to read about your experiences here. You pointed out things that I take for granted, and made me appreciate what we have here more. It's always been home, and I hope it always will be. One point I have to disagree with you though: *bagels*. Once you have Montreal bagels, you can't go back. Others bagels are just round bread.
My dude never had a bagel in the States. It 100% does not taste like the Montreal bagel. They have bread in the shape of a donut.
1. Yay for Haitian food!
Your post was such a delight to read thank you !
As a french guy from France living in Montreal for a year now the "French people - From France" had me laughing hard for some reason
1. Try Fairmount Bagel, they're better.
This remark...  
>Why cant I turn right on a red? that makes no sense.
Green = GO
Red = STOP
Suggesting that red should mean STOP but also GO in certain circumstances makes no sense.
Great post. Two comments
1) I'm from montr√©al, and I really don't care about st-viateur or fairmount bagels. I really never got the hype. I actually got some at st-viateur that were half-baked once. The friend I was with kept telling how great the bagels were. I was like "this is uncooked bread ". I'll get mine at the grocery store 6 for 2$. I'm probably a person of no culture. 
2) I also lived in the suburbs before and I can tell you that the turning on red is a problem for pedestrian and cyclists. Well, it wouln't be so much of a problem if people actually stopped, looked and then turned. Too many people just turn without stopping, had 2 closed calls like this. Once biking, once, walking. 
3) I'm j-walking all the time. 
4) Not sure about the reason for oudoor stairs. Less interior space to heat during the winter? 
voil√†!
Great post, totally agree about the alleged rudeness.  I live in Vancouver now and people here are 100x more rude than anyone I met in Montreal.
Here's an explanation I read recently about the stairs:
>Each unit in a plex has its own door, with its iconic exterior stairs. In Europe, there is only one front door and the stairs are inside. The city wanted to avoid having buildings too close to the street, which reduced the amount of each lot that buildings could be built on. So to save space, the builders chose to use the stairs leading to the apartments outside the building. Not having an internal staircase also reduces the amount of unnecessary space to be heated during the winter
As for the rudeness part, I have also heard that from many English Canadians and it kinda baffles me. There are just so many presumptions about quebec from people who haven't set foot here since the last referendum 25 years ago. 
I've met many Canadians travelling that thought Qu√©bec was a third world hellscape where the language police hunted down anyone who mispronounced "bonjour". Anyways, a large part of Montrealers are english speakers, no one is surprised or angry at someone speaking English. Although I'll admit I'll get pissed at at someone who works at a store and can't answer me in basic French.
The part about the guy from the prairie living Laval and Longueuil people was the best part. Lmao.
Now I have to go chill with prairie dudes to see the comparison. Thanks!
>	What‚Äôs with the stairs?
>
>	The city really fell in love with outdoor staircases huh? Kind of sketchy in the winter. Looks cool for some reason.
This is because of the zoning/easement rules in the early 1900s. The lots were TINY, and required to be set a certain distance back from the curb. Rather than waste valuable interior space for stairs, they opted to build them outside, and often required pretty crazy curves, etc, to keep them inside the bounds of the lot.
There wasn‚Äôt a template per-se, but the requirements basically created it.
I'm Eastern European and was delighted to see that the foods Montrealers brag most about (bagels and smoked meat) are from my neck of the woods. The first time I tasted a St-Viateur poppy bagel, it reminded me of home (tho we do them just a bit denser and thinner).   
Also, I love cycling too, but just like OP I can't help but chuckle when I see the "tour de France" types all decked out in expensive performance gear for a 10 km/h stroll down the residential bike paths. I often wonder how much of a ritual and prep work they must be going thru every time they want to go for a bike ride. Meanwhile, I just throw on a regular tshirt and some shorts, put my $50 helmet on, hop on my 12-year old $200 Canadian Tire clunker and hit the road in less than 5 minutes.
Crazy drivers? Have you ever been to literally any other city?!
Same thing with being rude... Compared to NY people here are angels!
> 4) What‚Äôs with the stairs?
[Why Montreal Has Outdoor Staircases - MTL Blog](https://www.mtlblog.com/why-montreal-has-outdoor-staircases)
tl;dr rural building style, foundation setback required by law, landlords don't need to heat them, and possibly Catholic morals
"Sidenote: I‚Äôve never seen people respect cross walks so religiously. No one J-walks." 
That's because the cops give j-walking tickets allot... Got like 12 in 3 years.... Once the guy was on horse, and once the guy pulled his minivan thing on the sidewalk to stop me... One time they made a freaking lineup to give like 6 of us tickets.
It's like a few times a year they have contests on who can give more j-walking tickets or something...
This one hits home on the off islanders.
Hard disagree on the first two.
I'm from BC, so for me bagels were bland bread things from the grocery store, vehicles for cream cheese to go into my mouth and nothing more. Montreal bagels are so flavourful with that little hint of sweetness, and when they're fresh or warm, they're so soft. I can eat one plain, and I would never eat a bagel plain anywhere else.
The driver thing... it sounds like you haven't ventured off-island much. The speeds are ridiculous and the following distances are nonexistent. If there were ever an accident up ahead where I had to brake suddenly, the guy behind me is going to come straight through my windshield. And what's with the "parking" by putting flashers on? Are flashers just a "get out of ignoring the law free" card? Can I rob a bank and use that as my defence? "Yes, that's me on the security camera pointing the gun, but you can also clearly see that I have my hazard lights flashing"? City driving in Montreal is the normal clusterfuck, but it's once you get on the highway that you really see the terrible Quebec driving in full force.
Thanks for a great post.
I moved to Montreal from Paris and had many similar observations. I fell in love with Montrealers and much about the city‚Ä¶ the length of the winter killer me though.  My last year there we got 1m of snow May 4th‚Ä¶ I was done :)
I come back several times a year (except during Covid) and it always feels like home.
I agree that some of our rules suck. Av du Parc has a fantastic straight stretch with a speed limit of 40km/h. Obviously no one does 40, and people overtake you when you're doing 60. Boul St Joseph has a 30km/h part east of Papineau which should clearly be a 50 zone. Moreover they enforce the speed limit there so you have to do 30. Similar story with highways.
No right turn on red is a good rule though. I feel like it would do more harm than good. 
IMO the reason why some say we're crazy drivers is that you have to switch lanes quite often and quickly to go from any point A to point B in less than 45 minutes because of the turn lanes (or lack thereof)
In a regular city you have one or two lanes going straight and dedicated turn lanes. We mostly have 2 lane roads with no dedicated turn lanes. So you gotta figure out which lane to stay on to avoid getting stuck behind a bunch of people turning left to Papineau.
Taxis do pretty much whatever they want to do, buses can cut you off anytime because they have the "priority" and Ubers can stop anywhere anytime. Also now that students are back and bars are reopened, it's better to avoid St Laurent between Sherbrooke and Rachel. I almost hit a car pulling out of a parking spot without checking their mirrors a couple of hours ago on St Laurent
Combine all this with horrible roads and never-ending construction, and you have Montreal drivers. But surprisingly it still works, because at the end of the day people know what to do to get home as quickly as possible without getting a ticket.
I‚Äôd really like to ask my older brother who did the reverse how it‚Äôs like to be a Winnipeger after being born and raised in Montreal !
1. Bagels are great they do taste better but I agree that it‚Äôs overhyped. If you want some √† tomber par terre griot I highly suggest Shandmas near M√©tro Frontenac
2. It‚Äôs precisely because it sucks for drivers that it ain‚Äôt so bad for other pedestrians and cyclists. Portage Avenue made me feel like walking on Taschereau, great by car, super unwelcoming if you‚Äôre walking along 
3. I can only say that suburbanites are suburbanites everywhere!
4. Mandatory setbacks plus less heating
5. Yes. No one is rude if you try speaking French, au contraire.
Mayonnaise on fries is a Dutch/Flemish thing. Just ask Vincent in Pulp Fiction
LOL outdoor staircases are catholic holdovers, so everyone can see whose coming and going into your house (not sure if that true, but thats what my very catholic very MTL family always says)
Great post...I‚Äôm a winnipegger who lived in Montr√©al for 5 years and mostly concur...a couple of insights I never reached
I wish I'd known that the signs here make no sense, highway design and traffic planning is beyond a disaster, and that everyone is used to it and sees no real problem.  Even though most people have seen actual good roads and traffic planning in the US.  I want to scream sometimes.
Can you elaborate on "the beautiful women that wear no make-up"? What is your basis of comparison and how do Montreal women rank?
Merci beaucoup pour les gentils mots, c'est ben appr√©ci√© :)
If I can add a note, Montreal isn't that representative of the whole of Quebec. A significant proportion of the population is bilingual, and we have large amount of Anglophones too. This, plus immigration, leads to more openness, tolerance and flexibility. But once you leave Montreal, you'll realise that the rest of the province isn't really like that. French is more entrenched, people are less tolerant of outsiders and I always get the "where are you from" and "your French is really good", something I never hear in Montreal (I'm born in Montreal of Moroccan immigrants, and French is actually my second native language, while English is only a distant 3rd).
>Why is the limit on decarie 70km? We are all going 100, these signs are not working.
That is why they are 70km. If they were 100km, the drivers would be going 130km. They work with the local mentality.
>No one J-walks
True in some boroughs, false in others. Also Winnipeggers j-walk like crazy downtown. That's just 'walking'.
>People from off the island ‚Äì This might sound strange, but people from Laval and Longueil are basically Winnipegger‚Äôs that speak French.
Agreed, those areas are very much like St. Boniface. (source: also from Wpg)
>mayonnaise with French fries
Yes, but you need to try mayo with harissa sauce at Frites Alors. Even better. Also, try the merguez (sausages) at the local Arabic green grocer/butcher shop. Bagels are nice but the merguez is pure magic.
> I was promised rudeness at every opportunity. Really not the case at all. Everyone is super helpful. 
Same experience. Everyone has been helpful,  friendly, often fun. Never had a problem with language stuff, not even the switching to English thing - I just switch it back.
what's a chest fanny pack ?
*But its bread and sesame seeds, Calme-toi. They exist in literally every grocery store across the country*
Get. Out. (This is where my rude side comes out!)
Can i add something that surprised me? A group of friends tends to span different age groups in a way I've never seen before. Elderly people out for a good time with much younger people even at night. This was shocking to me. 
Montrealers are not at all rude when you're trying to learn french
Montreal bagels are trash compared to new york bagels. FIGHT ME.
RANDOM: many dudes here have full heads of hair. I rarely see bald guys. Am i crazy? Is it the French genetics?
Love watching french guys in the plateau smoke cigarettes. MARRY ME
People here are a lot more open and down to earth about dating but a bit more mysogynistic/traditional
<3
> Where I‚Äôm from if a restaurant says its open until 9 and you walk in at 8:55 you are getting served. Here if its not busy and you show up at 8:30 they tell you ‚Äútoo bad.‚Äù 
yeah this one even as a native qu√©b√©cois who's supposed to know better fucking sucks
Fucking loved this bro.
Thank you.
I get what you're saying about the bagels, but at the same time it's probably the best bagel in the entire world, so even thought it's just "good", it's still the best and that's something big.
What a great summary :)
> Why is the limit on decarie 70km? We are all going 100, these signs are not working.
if the limit was 100 yall going to do 120.  look at the 440
The women are quite simply gorgeous and down to earth
6. I walked into a restaurant at 8.15. Closing time was 9. I wanted to sit down and eat. This fucker was eye rolling to everyone who walked in. I got annoyed and took to go instead.
The traffic laws are so true! Kane filtering omg Montreal what could you be!
Moving there soon. This post makes me warm and fuzzy on the inside :)
Really happy with how this one turned out. My favorite details are the trash bins, garbage bags, the wheat paste graffiti, and the Montreal-accurate manhole covers. Oh yeah, and the poutine plate the one dude is running off with makes me giggle. The Bill W. Posters and the Wilding board. There's a lot that I like about this one I guess. Not sure what else to say about this one really. It was a lot of fun to make. Open to questions, I suppose. If you want to see the rest of my models, and some in-progress shots of my work, and previews of what I'm working on next, you can find me on Instagram, @apocalypse_montreal. Thanks!

That's how la Banquise looks in the minds of some /r/Quebec users.
What inspired this project? How long does one take? Really cool!
Haven't i seen the Sake graf around?
You should post these on r/miniworlds
Hey man ! So glad to see another piece from you. Once again the details just fascinate me. On this one what held my attention the most were the graffiti and paint job on the walls. I mean, you managed to make it real AF. I did smile too at the guy with the poutine. Nice touch.
I miss Monteal so much :(
I wonder what apocalyptic poutines are made of
Where is the biggest landmark, ORANGE CONE?
Is this a specific location or just a Montreal-esque street?
Edit: seen some of your others btw. I like

That's very creative! Nice!
Wow! It looks amazing AND now I'm craving poutine
The end of the world won‚Äôt be so bad. At least there won‚Äôt be any line at la banquise for once.
Really great work again mate. Do you film yourself doing these? I'd love to see the process. What happens to the models after you're finished with them? 
I'd love to see you do the Ubisoft building in Mile End
Do you have a website or instagram? That's so amazing!
Looks like a regular night circa 2am!

Yooo the art on the walls are on point! Fin du mondez fin du mois, m√™me combat is my new motto as a struggling low wage employee!
I really like how big you made that poutine it's like a birthday cake, nice leavel a detail
Love the old school KOPS (as well as the rest)

√áa risque d'√™tre d√©truit, mais si je me souviens de ce que le site H√©ritage Montr√©al disait, c'est un b√¢timent priv√© dont l'√©tat de d√©cr√©pitude ne met pas directement en danger les constructions environnantes, donc tant que le priv√© ne d√©bloque pas des fonds - pour d√©truire ou pr√©server -, √ßa restera √† s'ab√Æmer jusqu'√† ce que √ßa devienne un dossier municipal et que le contribuable paie pour. 
Sauf que c'est aussi l'un des exemples historiques (et encore debout) de silo en b√©ton au Canada (mes souvenirs sont vagues, pr√©cisions bienvenues) et que l'on devrait le classer comme patrimoine industriel pour le pr√©server et non le d√©truire... m'enfin...

Le message est assez clair. Qui tu penses qui a le pouvoir de dire au policier d‚Äôaller ou non? Celle qui finance 20 millions au SPVM en 2021.
C'est √ßa que je dis. C'est pas la police qui a d√©cid√© de faire √ßa.

En tout cas, j'la trouve fucking belle ta photo.

Yea that's a sick pic
Love this picture!
Montreal is one beautiful city. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Affiche pour la promotion du film "A werewolf in Montreal"
definitely need a higher resolution version of this beautiful pic
Amazing
Moontreal ?
Woooow, excellent framing. Amazing shot, nice work!
C'est f√©erique!.
Wow this is so beautiful. Do you have a high res version?
Nicely done.
Stunning! I would totally buy a print of this! You making any for sale?
Nice shot!
That's a really cool picture.  Montreal looks like a little island of city life in the middle of wilderness and mountains.  Almost like a fortress.  It's really interesting.  Hopefully I can visit one day.
And the bridge is still standing.  For now.
Soo good!
Belle!
Found my new lockscreen
Merci c'est gentil!
Thank you! I was a small stretch of land that was not submerged by water near Pratt and Whitney in Longueuil.
Thank you!
Thank you! That's really appreciated!
Yes indeed!
I keep the high definition for my clients but I take it as a compliment! Thank you!
Thank you!
Thanks, it was a couple hours of waiting to get the moon centered on Montreal.
Merci!
Thank you! 
I keep the high resolution for the prints.
Thank you!
Thank you! Yes sure, I'll DM you in the morning.
Thank you!
Thank you! But not to disappoint, there's not much mountains near Montreal. Still a beautiful city with a lot to see and to taste!
Merci!
Do you have a website?
We get it, you vape... 
But more seriously, whereabouts was this taken on the Canal? It's a bit hard to tell, but it looks like the area by the abandoned Canada Malting plant looking eastward (St-Ambroise at St-R√©mi).
i think it was smog...according to the air quality advisory
\*smog
where is all that smog coming from?
I really wish they'd clear the path....
Reminds me of the movie "The Mist".
Queue silent hill theme
Amazing, thankyou for sharing! I looove fog\~  
(There IS a smog warning today mind you)
r/Mistborn
Apparently...if you get a fog in January, it means you'll have a rainy spring.
oh wow
We had a ton of fog in the Burlington VT area this morning as well.
Gorgeous.
Fog (Again)
Haha you're exactly right, I was just before the Canada Malting Plant
Un m√©lange. Toutefois c'est surtout le brouillard qui bloquait la vue. La couche de smog √©tait pas tant pire et est rest√©e toute la journ√©e.
There was hardly a rush hour..
*smaug
Non, c'est du brouillard
C'√©tait ma question aussi. Y fait pas si frete donc, y doit pas avoir tant de foyers qui br√ªle. On est en confinement donc, y doit pas avoir tant de voiture qui se d√©place. Alors, √ßa vient de o√π?
C'est surtout du brouillard sur la photo, toute la vall√©e du Saint-Laurent √©tait plong√©e dedans.
That movie had a great ending
May or may not have breathed in a bunch of smog
As an avid road cyclist, I ride past there a few hundred times a year. I'm just not used to seeing that stretch in the snow and fog.

*Shmog
Non, c'√©tait du smog
[Smog](https://lp.ca/eKGHn7)
roadie here, I call it "the smell of yeast that comes from the east" if the wind comes from that direction.
Where the heck is it coming from?
*smogh
I didn‚Äôt know the canal ran through Outremont ü§î
Oui, il y avait du smog, mais ce qui a r√©duit la visibilit√© c'est le brouillard. La raison pour laquelle il y avait du smog est la m√™me de pourquoi il y avait du brouillard, une inversion thermique. Il y avait une couche d'air plus chaude en altitude (environ 100m) qui bloquait les mouvements convectifs venant du sol, en plus d'un vent absent. 
Ainsi, une masse d'air plus froide est rest√©e ¬´pogn√©e¬ª sous le couvercle d'air plus chaud, mais l'humidit√© √©tait √©lev√©e, le point de ros√© √©tait presque le m√™me que la temp√©rature, l'humidit√© s'est donc condens√©e en cr√©ant un brouillard √©pais. Plus tard durant la matin√©e, lorsque le soleil a r√©ussi √† transpercer le brouillard, r√©chauffer le sol et permettre des mouvements convectifs plus forts, qui ont permis √† l'air au sol de percer le couvercle le brouillard s'est dispers√©. C'est pour √ßa que le brouillard est disparu assez t√¥t. M√™me si le smog a r√©duit la visibilit√©, il n'avait pas un effet si gros, l'air serait irrespirable si c'√©tait le cas. Quand le couvercle a √©t√© perc√©, le smog a pu se disperser et faire lever l'alerte, mais le manque de vent lui a quand m√™me permis de rester en partie. En soir√©e, j'√©tais all√© sur le bord du fleuve sur la rive-sud, et je voyais une petite couche de smog sur la ville qui r√©duisait la visibilit√©, mais rien de comparable au brouillard du matin.
Pour te prouver, toute la Vall√©e du Saint-Laurent √©tait plong√©e dans un brouillard, tandis que le smog se limitait au Grand Montr√©al. Une faible visibilit√© a √©t√© mesurer dans des secteurs comme Howick, Venise-en-Qu√©bec et Burlington.[Voici](https://imgur.com/QDdDZxf) une image prise par un satellite g√©ostationnaire, j'ai encercl√© en rouge les zones plong√©es dans un brouillard.
Wood burning and transportation + light wind and cold temperatures. Winter is actually our worst air quality period in Quebec.
Looks like this year isn't 2021, but 2020+1, so I don't expect much.
Tl;dr
That's a shame. Such a beautiful place.
Barely anyone burns wood anymore...
Tl;dr si le smog √©tait aussi gros, ce serait irrespirable et extr√™mement dangereux. C'est surtout du brouillard.
The schools quit too...

All jokes aside. Great picture.
Looks great. This is why I love winter

I moved here in the summer and a few snow days later, I still can't get over how beautiful the city looks under a blanket of snow.
Coming soon - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvN-HLf_ekM
I don't know if this is borough-specific:
When a side of the street indicates no parking for a couple hours for snow clearing, can you park your car immediately after the side is cleared or do you still have to wait until the time the signage indicates?
Verdun is really tricky since we have no permit parking and so many people are working from home right now.
Calm and quit. Just how I like it.
Don't quit. Believe in yourself.
It's really pretty right now, the backyard is filled with snow, it all looks like everything is coated with white frosting or sprinkled with icing sugar.
I don't mind a big snowstorm as long as I don't have to go anywhere...also, we haven't really had a terrible winter so far, we had like zero snow in December. Better than freezing rain!
It also looks like the snow conditions this weekend are going to be fantastic. Fresh snow, not too cold! enjoy!
*quiet
Exp√©riences may vary.

I had forgotten how lovely Montreal could be... From Trois-Rivi√®res, I miss you guys!
I love it so much right now üôèüèª
Very beautiful.
Ye man, I‚Äôve quit outside too
I love summer but dislike that there are too many loud people outside who are inconsiderate.
I wish for a place that has all four seasons but with introverts mostly. 
Beautiful picture!
If my teachers would have told me to stay quit in class, I would have left.  I hope yours told you to stay quiet instead, like mine did.
Waiting for it here in Nova Scotia.... commung soon
Yooooo Tupper street, i used to live there
Downtown quit or is quiet??
That was such a gift this morning -- I haven't had a proper day off since Christmas break. Every one of us in education are overworked and exhausted too.
It's nothing.. we got alot more in the past (I live in Mtl too). Did you mean quit or quiet?
[deleted]
> Not pictured: loud snow removal machines with blaring sirens.
My hometown (Minneapolis) also gets tons of snow and while *in general* I think Montreal does a better job of handling snow removal, I do appreciate that Minneapolis manages to get it done without those stupid fucking sirens.
They have fixed rules that everyone's expected to know for where you can/can't park when the city declares a Snow Emergency ("the first day, park on this side, then on the other side the next day," that kind of thing). When the rules need to come into effect, it gets announced at least a few hours in advance, and they announce it on the website, on social media, in the news, on TV, on radio, etc, and you can sign up for alerts by text/phone call/email/app. 
It's slightly more complicated to keep track of than "oh shit oh fuck I hear a horn, better move it now," but still effective and *significantly* quieter. I wish Montreal would adopt a system like that.
Oh god they are so noisy late in the night and in the morning !!! Sometimes I just assume they are noisy on purpose so everyone notices they are here and get the job done
I agree, whether it's winter or summer, Montreal's sceneries are so pleasant and restful.
J'avais mal √† ma g√©ographie. Merci MVP!
Right on it!! Good job for recognizing it üëä
You‚Äôre pretty lucky! Don‚Äôt know where you were living before but this is the most beautiful winter we‚Äôve had in a long time!
lmao so true
yes you can!! if you make suuuure there's not gonna be another snow machine coming. I have few friends who told me these kind of stories.
I am more of a quit inside type of person.
Maybe Finland would be up your alley
quiet\* my man
Man if there's people I sympathize with these days it's the healthcare workers and education workers. I hope you get the best of days off today and that many more are to come once this is over.

Yes. (It was a play on the typo)
Grrrrriiinnnnnn.. (even if no snow to plow on April 29th)...nnnnnndddddddiggugugugddddd...
All jokes aside. Great pothole.
Me: hear the move your car beep-boop.
Also me: look out the window to judge the people who didn't move their cars.
Cars: none.
As far as I can tell, the plow order algorithm is the same each time. Today I moved my car to the other side of the street ("plowing round 3") since I had it parked on the "plowing round 2" side. The unknown is how long it takes them to get to rounds 2 and 3, hence the placards/chaos/sirens.
The sirens are actually a last minute notice for people to move their cars and not be towed/ticketed.... Something that took me three years to figure out....ü§£ü§£
To a point - it's nice when it's just snowed, but they the plows and the cars and the dogs and the weather conspire to make it a disgusting brown mess.
:(
Winter or summer? Autumn is the best Montreal season of all due to Mount Royal being a blazing red, yellow, and orange backdrop to downtown. 
But I certainly also miss how Montreal looks in winter during and after a snowfall, not that Ottawa, where I live now, is all that different.
Thanks. I can't help it, whenever I see a picture, I have to find where it is...

Hi more of a quit inside type of person, I'm Dad! :)
Reinventing your entire curriculum for hybrid delivery (multi-level classes), alternating distance/school (sec 3-4-5), and in person for some classes takes a LOT of prep time.
(Yeah, I guess I was too drunk to post this on the original post, you had the essence of what I meant ;) )
I know I shouldn't say this but... I miss Montreal in the winter (currently living in Toronto).
Je sais que je ne devrais peut-√™tre pas dire √ßa, mais je m'ennuie de Montr√©al l'hiver( j'habite √† Toronto en ce moment).

wow cute
And It‚Äôs the best kind of snow for snowman sculpting and snowball fight.
J'aime les trottoirs large comme √ßa
It seems to have slowed down...I wonder if we're going to get as much as they predicted.
The ski hills are going to be super this weekend.
**OPPA**
I live north of montreal, near mont-tremblant, i had snow higher than my knees. I had to go to work, my car got stucked everywhere ü§£
Beautiful photo !
My snow covered sidewalk*
Pretty
Such a beautiful shot!!
I lived in Nova Scotia for a couple years and I missed the Montreal winters too!
I've heard people say that, they miss the real anarchy of a Montreal winter...less snow and milder in TO but just endlessly gray.
Spent 5 years in TO. Their winter is just sad. But a great city. I wish more quebecers could experience it.
It's understandable, winter is miserable but then theres snow days like today and its peaceful and magical
I just moved to Montreal from Toronto and it‚Äôs my first winter here. It‚Äôs beautiful! Toronto seems to get more.. ice storms that breaks everything lol
why shouldn't you be saying that

Thank you!
This ain't a sidewalk, it has to be a two-way street!

I definitely missed the snow and cold. Nova Scotia winters are mostly rainy and windy with some snow here and there. Not as beautiful as Montreal winters
I usually take a summer trip to Toronto, it's great and the food too!
It was a tongue in cheek comment as I know a lot of people complain about the winter conditions in Montreal and I myself did complain out loud about the occasional - 40c weather. I did appreciate the milder winters when I moved to Toronto but I miss the scenery of Montreal in the winter.
It‚Äôs Ville-Emard on Briand ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I would be totally down for a city wide snowball fight if there‚Äôs no pandemic.
yes, still snowing a bit but the warnings are dropped, so we probably won't see a lot more. It's just too mild! 
It looks like we got about what, 10 cm?
snow I don't mind. It's normal and we need it, and there hasn't been a lot of snow this winter. We even had a green christmas. I guess if it had been cold enough, that rain would have been a snowstorm. I would definitely rather have snow than ice or freezing rain. At least you can shovel snow and it's a lot less dangerous. 
I think the average per winter is 9 snowstorms.
Yea, TO has pretty good food. Favorite place was Lee and their perfect 20 ingredients slaw.
...we don't get -40 in Montr√©al lol. also if you complain about the cold that means you just don't know how to dress properly. people take heavy winters for granted and when they don't have them anymore they complain that they're gone
Definitely at least 10cm, if not a bit more. It‚Äôs been consistent all day
I‚Äôd definitely always prefer snow not only for the ease of shovelling and getting it out of the way but because it‚Äôs just prettier and fun
Oooh never tried. I loved the variety of asian places and super tradition korean restos. And there was this excellent syrian place last time I went called Fat Pasha

If you go naked outside, yes - significantly faster, in fact. Rip you
Not if you arrive in summer
No but you might find the summers oppressive. It's hot and humid in Montreal during the summer months. At least you can bundle up in wintertime.
as a dog owner parc la fontaine is better lol
C'est une averse de neige, une giboul√©e. C'est typique du mois de mars et avril, alors que le temps se r√©chauffe et que des petits nuages convectifs font leur apparition. Ils sont souvent la cause des bourrasques de neige, tr√®s dangereuses.

Well, if we're going to be pedantic, it's the Five Roses sign, but it's no longer the Five Roses building.
Oh nice! Which city is that in, Boston?
It‚Äôs because not many people bend neon lights like that anymore. I‚Äôd be ok if they made signs with LED light in a similar style, as long as they weren‚Äôt too bright
It‚Äôs in the farine dude, you can‚Äôt change it.

Intersection 9 3/4
‚ÄúYer a Montrealer, Harry‚Äù
It acts as a kind of cul the sac in TMR.
It‚Äôs on my run route.
These streets should all be considered cul de sac for the most part between Rockland and Acadie.
Just need a u-turn forbidden sign and it would be perfect.
That cul de sac is one pain in the cul
The only thing left to do is set your car on fire with poutine oil to not leave any marks.
You've reached the end of montreal, congrats.
Bruh...... Thats the best picture Ive seen so far in Montreal
I assume a U-Turn is mandatory and the Left turn sign was knocked by a snowplow truck. Good luck if you are driving anything bigger than a car
Ahh TMR the land of being lost in suburbia
Yousse √† Morial?
La seule explication que je peux voir c‚Äôest que le panneau virage √† gauche obligatoire s‚Äôest fait ramasser par la gratte, et qu‚Äôil est suppos√© faire face vers notre droite. Les voitures qui s‚Äôen viennent par l√† ne peuvent pas continuer tout droit et doivent tourner √† gauche.

Haha, I know exactly where this is. I cut across here on my bike to get to cheap Indian food and/or cross the tracks in Parc Jarry.
I knew this gave me vibes of Acadie/Outremont. Corner of Selwood and Brookfield.
C'est un carambolage de voitures autonomes en devenir.
Brookfield Ave in TMR
This is also how Montreal puts detours for construction
I guess you‚Äôre meant to U-turn. Weird setup though. 
It would make more sense if this were a one way itself away from the intersection.
Whoever put the signs up was very much /r/NotMyJob
This almost like fine Art.
It looks like you are on the wrong way lol
TMR? Looks familiar..so classic haha
Only in quebec
I just noticed a right arrow on the left. I thought the problem here was the contradictory signs ¬´¬†turn left¬†¬ª, and ¬´¬†no left or right turn¬†¬ª, lol. Either way this intersection is super confusing
Just backup. üòú
Hmm looks like TMR? most of Montr√©al has ‚Äúpermitted‚Äù signs (green circle) instead of ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù signs (red circle). Only a handful of boroughs (TMR and Westmount come to mind) have these (and Anglo stop signs).
Go straight, obviously.
"WHAT ARE YOU DOING? IT'S A ONE-WAY STREET"

Why would this only be in Montreal?

Stop!
Lol
Turn left? I think the don‚Äôt turn left or right sign with the red circle cancels out the two black and white arrows saying turn left and right. Thus, leaving the left arrow in the green circle. 
Or it‚Äôs just a confusing perspective and makes since closer to the arrete sign.
üôàüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüôà that‚Äôs so stupid ! I live in Montreal as well and you‚Äôre totally right.
Had some business meetings in Montreal. I was about to go under the 520 and saw a works vehicle ahead. It was a cherry picker with a guy with a hammer in hand. I slowed down to see the guy start hammering away and pieces of concrete showering the road in front of me. No signs, no warning, just a guy hammering away making a mess of the road. I learned this is typical for Montreal as I have never seen this anywhere else. They didn't even see me. I just waited until he was done and they just drove away. No cleanup, nothing.
also, whats up with neighborhoods with nothing more than 2 floors high, with the exception of one ugly 12 floor brown block ?
Only in TMR.
selwood is fun, longest street in TMR without an address
That's Ogilvy corner L'Acadie on the other side of the fence. My dog groomer is right across the big building. Guys been there forever, like 40 years at least.
Haha TMR
Ha! Take a drive on Pine Avenue where the lanes shift not once, but twice, and for no apparent reason other than the line painters employed by the city are incompetent. At each "switch", they move about 4 feet. Happens twice. If you are trying to stay in the lanes, there's a good chance you'll sideswipe someone.
It‚Äôs in TMR and it‚Äôs because of a fence between park extension and TMR. It acts as a cul de sac and it‚Äôs quite nice. There are never any cars there so ill often just go down the wrong way and its fine

Got my upvote
I always thought this was Anthony Bourdain
The leonard cohen exhibit is one of the best museum experiences I've ever had and I didn't really know anything about him before going into it.
So is it a rule that this mural has to be posted at least one a week on this sub?
I thought this was Anthony Bourdain when i first saw it
Non, mais est-ce qu'on peut en revenir de cette murale?
Jazzy Mr Spock!
Wow! Belle photo
Tr√®s belle photo ! Thanks for sharing!
Beautiful pic
Great @ElMac mural even better the closer you get
Very nice picture!
Very clean shot! Thanks for sharing :)
My cousin took that exact same picture on the same day... I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre my cousin or you stole that picture haha
Love this.
I always wanted to take that picture! With the snow it‚Äôs so Montreal.
Tr√® jolie!
I don't know if this is an unpopular opinion, but I vastly prefer the other Cohen mural that is on Napoleon St. near Saint-Laurent Boulevard. I find the other one is more visually striking.
The heart ‚ù§Ô∏è of downtown!!!! Mtl ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Turned his back on the city. Overrated performer and he gets idolized ?

Is it showing anywhere in the city now?
A lot of people started to care only once he died
Une semaine sur deux. L'autre semaine c'est quelqu'un qui a d√©couvert le belv√©d√®re sur le Mont-Royal
They actually do share quite a resemblance
Laissons donc les nouveaux √©tudiants de McGill avoir leur fun ;)
Ok. D√©sol√©.
Anthony bourdain probablement
So edgy
Yeah, considering he was not a singer. He was a poet and a songwriter. Do you go tell people Dylan‚Äôs not a good singer? Everybody knows that, even Dylan.
That's because he was more of a songwriter/poet than a singer. He was closer to a Bob Dylan than say, a Robert Plant. Not the best voice, but but had a real way with words.
Singer is a stretch.  Poet who reads to music is more on target.
Better late than never. He was pretty talented. It's nice to know his work will be enjoyed long after his death too.
That's not true at all. Has he been talked about more after his death? Yes. But he was still a huge name and a highly-revered artist when he was still alive. Foreign artists doing live renditions of Hallelujah as a tribute to him when they play in Montreal is a tradition that goes way back when he was still alive.
Leonard Cohen
[deleted]
Shit, i just saw your post and wrote pretty much exactly the same thing!
I bet Dylan wouldn't even win "America's got talent".../s.
[deleted]
What are you saying is not true in my statement exactly? You just said yourself he has been talked about more after his death. He was still very known before and still making albums, that doesn't remove that fact.
I was mostly bringing up that when an artist dies, they gain in popularity which I find a bit sad but it's been like this ever since artists exists probably. Like expensive famous paintings.
The guy got a mural after he dies only and now we see it on Reddit every 2 weeks(probably exaggerating here)
Cette murale doit √™tre nouvelle, je ne l'ai jamais vu post√© sur le sub ici
Every time... that's Leonard Nimoy!

When I go to the butterfly ü¶ãevent, I put shorts and a thin top on under my winter apparel. I check my clothes with my coat and enjoy a tropical vacation for a few hours. Wonderful
What?!? Le biodome semble tjrs full book. Good to know!!!
I can vouch for this! Went a few days ago with my family, it was very relaxing. Barely anyone inside.
Also, the outside grounds (which are free) made for a great walk, albeit there's not much greenery to see just yet.
I haven't been there in a while, this is a good idea
I miss my late-winter pilgrimage there this year. I hope the border opens up this spring.
It seems to be sold out for a whole month
Wow, thanks for that!
I have fond memories of Easter week visits with my grandparents back in the 1960s. The profundity of color at the bleak end of winter was the tonic we all sorely needed

It will take them forever to put tiny masks on all those butterfles...

C'est toujours complet parce que c'est juste 25 billets par demi-heure. Y'a un p'tit buffer pour ceux qui ont la carte des amis du Biod√¥me ou autre carte du genre, mais √ßa part vite anyway.
Yes! The Cultural Garden was sweet to explore (free). There was a lot of beauty seeing the Chinese buildings covered in snow :)
It would be nice to go back to social normalcy.
In the meantime mask up, stay clean and be conscious of your outings. We got this :)
Where did you check? They allow 25 people in, every 30 mins. I just checked the site, and it looks 100% open for the next few days.
Yeah I just went it was also empty, you can just buy tickets at the door. 16$ each for residents and depending how much you want to read about all the plants it takes around an hour.
My visit was a walk in with no reservation :)
They seem to be a little disorganized when it comes to number control and where the waiting areas are, so if you do go please bear with them, be patient with their system, respect your distance with others, stay polite and please please please know others are waiting outside to get in.
The biod√¥me looks fully booked, but not the Botanical Garden!
I went yesterday and booked tickets friday night but the time wasn‚Äôt ideal at 4 PM.
God dammit english lol
Curly hair? Oily skin? Easy to sweat? Worth it! üòÜ
Yes. I wore the cute one :)
..they still only allow 25 people in every 30m, it's not a fucking church.

Nah, pas assez de c√¥nes oranges.
pretty much highway 15 everyday
ca va ressembler √† √ßa au coin de la 15 Sud et la 40. Quand le Royal Mount va √™tre construit, oubliez ca traverser la M√©tropolitaine en moins d'une journ√©e.
Monter sur la m√©tropolitaine pis rentrer dans ta voie a toujours √©t√© un moment sp√©cial... Ouais je comprends la vibe. Par contre √ßa ressemble plus √† Laval quand les autoroutes finissent dans un chemin de campagne lol.
That's Jean-Talon near D√©carie, right?
Tell her it's not that easy. xD
Where‚Äôs the lie?
Plus de voies r√®glerait le probl√®me !

Encore le feeling que j'ai parfois quand je prends la 15 et je rejoint la 40 pour moins de 5 km ...
12 lane's, 5 and 6th cars are the assholes you met in Montreal trying to go faster by skipping people. Tell me I'm wrong. :p
Obviously guys it's a joke. People are driving like shit everywhere. :D
Ha ha!  If it was only that easy.  No anti-vax parade, no detours into one lane one way streets with bike paths on each side with no cyclist on them, no detours into detours that lead to a closed highway, no orange cone forest with absolutely no visible work being done for the last month, no lanes closed with an officer directing traffic and somehow making everything worse than if everyone just did whatever they wanted.
La fin de semaine, dans le Plateau, Rosemont, le Centre-Sud et Hochelaga, c'est pas mal le cas oui.
Depuis que le tunnel est ferm√© tout est bouch√©. Tout le monde essaye de prendre le pont Jacques Cartier et √ßa bouchonne ben raide.

The roads here are nowhere near that nice.
That‚Äôs what it IS like to drive in Montreal!
OK, mais je ne vois pas de nids de poule.
But it is tho....

Ctrl-F5, no one mentioned there's a giant mountain in the middle of the city. Of course there's going to be congestion.
Very pretty, there an atmosphere in it.
What's your process? this is amazing :)
Not to be that guy, but is this for sale? Leonard was my dude.
Tr√®s nice!
Beautiful!
I used to live in that building when I lived in Canada, seeing this filled me with sweet and wonderful memories.
Thank you :)
Nicely done!:) one of my fav streets!
Love ur username too lol
Man I miss going out now. Last time I did was near there with my gf, good times just us two
That‚Äôs a beautiful mood
Very nice!  I like how you captured the Leonard Cohen mural.
Lived at de la montagne-sherbrooke, just moved out of MTL. Had this view all the time, thanks for this.
Love it!
I stayed in an Air BnB in that building last time I visited. Lovely spot to spend two weeks.
This is beautiful!!!
It‚Äôs so beautiful
Excellent.
This is the building that made me want to move here.
Favorite street in mtl!
Very nice but you‚Äôre just missing the hundreds of ‚Äú√Ä Louer‚Äù signs...
thanks !
thanks! i sketched the outline in pencil, filled in a few layers of watercolor, and the cohen mural is in pencil then washed with water to make a litte more muted - I still wasn't sure if the styles clashed too much but was overall happy with the outcome.
edit: I also use ink pen for outlines and writing
I was wondering the same thing. Great piece!
He's my dude too, I loved him since I was a teen. I wasn't planning on selling it but i can run a few prints. Feel free to PM me.
Thanks :)
Thanks! It's a lively section of town when we're not locked down!
thanks <3
thank you!
i love this mural so much! also so nice to look down on it from the lookout on Mont-Royal.
Thank you!!
Thanks !  Montreal is so beautiful....
Thanks !
It's the building that makes me feel the most emotion in Montreal!
That mural really tied the street together!
that's so sad..
Very true. For me, there were so many late night runs to boustan on crescent street as a McGill student (luckily stayed in shape ha). Can‚Äôt wait to come back to visit. I‚Äôve had this as my wallpaper for a month.

Shouldn't this post be removed for the same reason the Canada Day posts are removed every year? The reason I was given is that the Canada Day posts have nothing to do with Montreal, but Canada. Just like this.. I'm not trying to be a dick, i just think both St Jean and Canada Day posts should be allowed.. To remove one because of a certain rule and not the other seems silly to me. Edit: I was told the Canada day posts were removed because they violated rule 1, and kinda rule 4. Both of which this post "technically" violates.
**Not sure why I'm getting downvoted.. I'm a proud Quebecois... I'm just saying if someone's going to quote a rule as a reason to do something, they should also have to follow it.. Moderators shouldn't be above the very rules they've established..

There's a picture of this mural being posted here at least once every two/three weeks. Are you being sarcastic?
I think it's been there for more than 2-3 years (first time I saw it was 3 years ago iirc)
This made me laugh, thank you. 
But also, yes.
I unironically thought it was him when I first saw it. In my defence, it was like a couple months after he died.
It represents his passion for food and travel

Maybe you're mixing it with the one of Anthony Bourdain that we see regularly? It's the first time I see this mural of Leonard Nimoy.
I thought the sarcasm was obvious.
It's RRSP season so posting a mural of an accountant makes sense.
Are you sure? We never saw a picture of that mural on this subreddit before.
I've convinced friends from outside Montr√©al that it's him and his it was painted because he loved our city/food
Yes, I believe he was vegetarian and he did love traveling on the Enterprise

Edit: Sarcasm is not something easily readable, especially when it‚Äôs an inside joke about this subreddit which I visit like three times a year. Use /s next time.
There is an episode of ‚ÄúParts Unknown‚Äù where he goes to Montreal/Quebec, and he says it is his favorite place in Canada. So there is some truth here.

Le Canada est peut-√™tre l'un des pays les plus avanc√©s au monde en terme de respect des droits et libert√©s individuels, rappelons que ceci n'a pas valu ni ne vaut encore pour toutes et tous. 
On ne peut pas choisir de c√©l√©brer seulement les parties qui nous conviennent, dans un exercice de fiert√© s√©lective.
Je crois que la chose raisonnable et sensible √† faire cette ann√©e est de se garder une petite g√™ne, mettre le drapeau en berne un moment, observer une grosse minute de silence, et r√©fl√©chir √† faire du Canada un meilleur pays, y compris et surtout pour ses peuples autochtones.

Edit: clarification, je blame les √©glises et la religion pour les massacres comme √ßa... Pas le gouvernement Canadien.
I'm proud to be Canadian but I'm also ashamed. I don't feel like celebrating in light of recent events. Yes, I knew about residential schools before, but indigenous communities are in a state of mourning right now and they need our support. I'm not saying 'fuck Canada," I'm saying that we need to learn to celebrate in a different way. Learning about indigenous history sounds like a way of doing that. It pains me to think how people don't consider indigenous peoples when they think of the Canadian identity. They're more Canadian than the rest of us. I grew up in an indigenous community and most Canadians have idea what it's like for them. There were kids in my grade 6 class who were alcoholics. They struggled in school, had trauma, and bullied other kids. They also faced constant segregation and racism. This was in the 90s. These problems aren't "history". This shit is happening NOW and it's shameful to ignore it or pretend that Canada is more important while ignoring actual Canadians who need our support.
Abolish this false federation already. Nothing to celebrate, st Jean was last week
It's moving day here, and lucky for the people who did move today because it's not very warm. I've seen people moving over the past few days when it's been SO hot and sticky, that's the worst. And yesterday it was pouring on and off, and I felt bad for anyone dealing with that. UGH. But so far I've been lucky on moving day in terms of weather and fortunately, I'm NOT moving this year. I did have two guys come to pick up my old gross tv and haul it away and gave them an extra 20 bucks for Canada Day!
We don't do that here
Sad Canada day
Vive le Quebec
Nope
I don‚Äôt think Canada is all that happy right now

What the actual fuck people. We are in the midst of digging up hundreds (if not thousands) of children's bodies. Does this seem like a time to celebrate?? 
Some of you are extremely lacking in any sort of empathy and it shows.
Canada has always sucks. People only start openning their eyes now that obvious shady things are revealed, but there's plenty no one is talking about.

yeah good idea to celebrte a country build on genocide. We shouldn't celebrate kkkanada today but mourn and stay silent to reaspect Indigenous peoples of kkkanada.
I just wish I could get my son's medication today, but the doctor has decided to go on vacation until next Tuesday. They really should have back-ups in place for things like that.
Man I get that we made mistakes in the past but it's not like that anymore why wouldn't we celebrate what we have become instead of being upset with what we were.
It's easy for French Canadians to be up in arms with Canada since they literally tried to leave our country. They were never proud to be Canadian.
I posted the exact same thing in /r/Quebec and the hate I am getting is crazy. 
Happy Canada Day !! Proud to be Canadian!!
Its cancel.

I feel oppressed now
Kind of a spaceships vibe!
Beautiful!
Whoa, that's a great shot indeed. 
Quite the challenge for sure.

That‚Äôs a great photo. Also, I love how the stadium looks low-poly.
Nice üëç
Very nice
Woah thats a very cool shot
Beautiful. It really shows off the shoddy workmanship of the stadium.
Looks like a Sandcrawler
Oh wow! Thanks for the feature u/stamatgeorge!
Nice!
Tellement magnifique, bravo au photographe ‚ô•Ô∏è
They should print and sell these!
Wow. Very nice. Great catch!
Wow that's a crazy picture

Amazing photo, love it!
This looks like a shot of those Destroyers in Star Wars!
Amazing shot!
‚Ä¶damn the Big O is just a concrete monstrosity
My pleasure üòÄ It's f. incredible!
Le haut de la tour (donc toute la portion qu'on voit sur la photo et plus) est en m√©tal et non en b√©ton comme c'√©tait planifi√©.
Yup. Steel
Je ne connais pas grand chose en photo, mais la saturation des couleurs fait que √ßa ressemble √† une photo qui aurait √©t√© prise dans les ann√©es 70 ou 80.
Wow. Belle image.
Ta photo est sexy. Tu as l'oeil !
One of the rare awesome shots in this sub. Beautiful.
The sky and the tree is making this shot so beautiful, love from Pakistan, huge fan.
Wow!
Vraiment une nice photo & cool processing
Wow, that's beautiful! Great composition and colour!
Doux jesus, t‚Äôas des choses √† m‚Äôapprendre. Nice shot!
Excellent on dirait une photo sur r/japanpics
Wow!
Magnifique ‚ù§Ô∏è
Nice framing, really good composition
Love the Japan showcase there, if you read some of the information you realize just how authentic it really is. Beautiful
Tr√®s Nice. Avec quoi as tu shoot√©?
I was there 6 weeks ago. Incredible experience.
Nice color
Great pic! Tried to get a similar angle when I was there and botched it terribly :)
Where?
Ok
Est-ce qu'un √©tudiant de l'UQAM qui a trop de temps libre s'est plaint que ce lieu est de l'appropriation culturelle ou pas encore?
Haha oui, la majorit√© de mes photos ont un old school vybe, je suis un gros fan du vieux cin√©ma
J'aime bien la saturation, personnellement.
Merci beaucoup <3 japprecie
Merci bcp :) je suis content que tu l'aie aim√©
Thank you :D <3
 i didn't know it was that rare
‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
Merci bcp :) √ßa me plais entendre que tu l'aie aimer

<3 merci et oui hahaha

Thank you so much :)
Omg i wasnt able to go to the japan one because i walked all day in many places and didnt have time to go, im so sad to hear the japan one is is also that good :(
I wanted to take pictures there so bad as well
Merci <3 :) avec un Fuji xt-200 et un viltrox 56mm f1.4
We can both agree on that, such an experience to feel another country while remaining in your own
Thank you very much :)
You probably didnt botched it dont worry :)
, it was probably the lens you were using , you need a 80mm or higher for the effect to work

√áa pourrait devenir le nouveau logo municipal
Beautiful, everything about Montr√©al summarized in one picture.
C'est dommage c'est vrai - et c'est certainement une grosse marque d'incivilit√© - mais si seulement il y avait plus de poubelles publiques!!
This should be the subreddit photo
Sans poop bags sur le trottoir c'est difficile de croire que c'est √† Montr√©al.
Tbnk the fucking cones
Should be the Habs logo
Chaotic neutral.
C'est mieux que n'importe ou √† terre I guess?
Ca manque de guns...
I mean, that's any major city though. At least Montrealers put their garbage *in* something!
La nature a horreur du vide.... Une boite, un bac ou n'importe quel recipient vide se transforme en poubelle en ville. C'est de m√™me.
Jaime bien l‚Äôillustration du  cafe 2L de tim
The big booty chicks in leggings that we have here help me put up with this
At least they tried to put the trash inside the cone
at least it's serving a purpose, unlike 99% of cones just sitting on the side of the street.
tres bon pour le tourisme !    yay !
j'pu capab
Ca repr√©sente parfaitement Montr√©al!
Est ce que c'est sur Rue Barr√©, par hazard?
Is this a banksy?
Mesdames et messieurs, voici les poubelles pour la nouvelle g√©n√©ration! Pu besoin des vieilles poubelles grises qu‚Äôon voit partout! :p
everyone is pissed off now...
M√™me la mairesse est absente
I mean‚Ä¶ in fairness here‚Ä¶ people are using the provided cans. They just need to be emptied more often.
Edit: I just realized that‚Äôs a cone lol
But‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs ok. Seriously in that image the sidewalk is pretty clean‚Ä¶
je promis cest pas juste montreal. toute les gros ville jhabitais cettais le meme
Clean citizens, dirty AF officials
Clearly a trash can is needed.
I love how people are trained to think that garbage is their problem when it is a systemic issue. 
We the people are led to believe that the excessive amounts of garbage generated from our consumption culture is our fault and that it is up to us to do something about it. NO. it is not JUST up to us. We need to stop bitching about photos like this and pretending like our individual efforts are what is needed (I'm doing my part bullshit) start collectively doing something, pressuring our municipal, provincial, and federal governments to fukn to enact laws and bring the hammer down on the asshole companies that keep producing waste packaged as products. 
Oh, and some real PSAs that respond to this shit, like the importance of REDUCING, RE-USING,  and THEN recycling, not to litter, not to use bottled water, etc etc etc.
Maybe even teach our kids these things LIKE IT MATTERS, because it really does.
Looks like the city needs a trash can there. It's like the desire path but for trash.
On l‚Äôaime quand m√™me Montr√©al lol
Criss√© dans le milieu d'une piste cyclable, cette image remporte les √©lections municipales haut la main.
and we wonder why the Pandemic goes on and on.
C'est clair! √áa ou un jeu devinette "est-ce que la ville r√©pare, o√π il s'agit d'une poubelle bien √©tablie?"
It‚Äôs missing the sidewalk dog shit to be complete.
Manque de guns
Montreal has way more public trash bins than most cities. That's not the problem.
√áa ne  changerait rien ‚Ä¶
Je seconde, wouahahaha!
Il y en avait dedans et de l'autre c√¥t√©... J'aurais du prendre la photo de l'autre c√¥t√© on aurait vu pie-ix en travaux derri√®re!
That's why I love this photo :,)
Bof...je suis parti 2 ans pass√©s et c‚Äô√©tait ma meilleure d√©cision √† vie. Les Montr√©alais sont conditionn√©s √† penser qu‚Äôils sont au centre de l‚Äôunivers mais la v√©rit√© c‚Äôest que c‚Äôest une ville assez overrated. C‚Äôest le fun pour le party mais mis √† part √ßa c‚Äôest une ville qui tombe en morceaux
r/cinquantecinquante
...ce que la ville ''r√©pare''... √ßa devient poubelle ben vite, non?
No it kind of is. There are never enough trash bins or public toilets. Still, doesn't excuse this kind of incivility.
They don't empty them on a regular basis and their distribution is uneven.
The problem is that they don't get emptied
La seule chose qu‚Äôon a de trop √† Montr√©al, c‚Äôest des humoristes.
Mais au moins il y aurait plus de poubelles publiques et personne ne pourra plus dire "ben l√† je fais comment avec mon m√©got/masque bris√©/contenant vide? Y'a pas de poubelles dans cette ville!" Quant √† nous, on pourra continuer √† leur dire qu'ils sont d√©biles et irrespectueux.
S√©rieusement c'est quoi ce d√©faitisme triste?
Ah oui, l√† par exemple avec Pie-IX dans le cadre on ne peut pas se tromper.
There is a registration schedule (EDIT: for [Clic Sant√©](https://portal3.clicsante.ca/)) that is on that page:
> The schedule is as follows:
    April 30 - age 50 to 59 
    May 3 - age 45 to 49
    May 5 - age 40 to 44
    May 7 - age 35 to 39
    May 10 - age 30 to 34
    May 12 - age 25 to 29
    May 14 - age 18 to 24
Ca me rend beaucoup trop heureux.

"√† elles seules les doses de Pfizer seront en quantit√© suffisante pour atteindre la cible du gouvernement Legault d'avoir vaccin√© 75% des Qu√©b√©cois (√¢g√©s de 18 ans et plus) qui le souhaitent au 24 juin"
Sur le site de la presse
Another detail is that they are considering creating a digital evidence of vaccination, such as a QR code that one can keep on their phone.
Has anyone heard anything about the possibility of moving up the 2nd dose to a delay of less than 4 months if there is more frequent and regular provision of doses?
C'est le parfait moment pour ouvrir une bonne bouteille et de c√©l√©brer!
I almost doesn‚Äôt feel real üôåüèºüôåüèºüôåüèº
Does anyone know at what time Clic Sant√© opens up registration on those dates?
I didn't realize how much of a morale booster this news would be until it hit me like a brick wall. I legit want to jump up and down in happiness. I just want my f*****g vaccine!
Does anyone know if this is only limited to citizens/PR holders? I‚Äôm an international student and want to know if i will be eligible
FYI, spots for 50+ are now (5pm Thu) available on the platform.
Hallelujah! I can‚Äôt wait!
On va tous √™tre vaccin√©s BEN AVANT le 24 Juin, mark my words.
This is great news ! But As an essential worker I feel a little angry . All of us had to work through out this whole pandemic no time off no free money from the government and what we can‚Äôt even get vaccinated before the general public ? I know some essential workers like teachers cops and what not have been able to get an appointment but what grocery store workers, warehouse workers etc we aren‚Äôt essential enough even tho we are at greater risk than everyone that get to work from home . I know this will probably get downvoted but oh well just had to say it ...
I‚Äôm 17 and not in school how the hell am I supposed to get mine?
FOUTRE OUI!!!!
Fina fucking lly
Y'a d'la lumi√®re √† la fin du tunnel les ami.e.sssssss
Finally some good fucking news.
Enfin esti!!!
And yet nothing will change .
50+ can book appointments right now btw don‚Äôt wait until tomorrow
I have created a website to easily search for tweets from vaccine hunters twitter account by your province, age group and postal code. Please have a look and comment if you have any feeback: [http://vaccineupdates.ca/](http://vaccineupdates.ca/).
does anyone know if the people who previously had covid still only need 1 dose of the vaccine, or if it will be the standard 2 doses?
I wonder if they will open to 16-17 year olds as it has in the US or if they will have to wait until all adolescents /kids can get it.
Enfin!
Sucks for people turning 40 on May 6 or 7...
I'm joking, I'm stoked we're finally going to get back to some version of normal.
Any confirmation on the vaccine brand? I assume it is AZ for general public?
[deleted]
Hmmm, I wonder when there will be a drop-in for the vaccines?
Can I register at 00:00 of the day?
Any idea on the type of vaccine they'll be offering to the general public? Will it be Astra Zeneca?
yaaaaas, finally
Woahhh
So to try book an appointment, if I just say 'yes' to "Are you in a priority group?" and book an appointment for the dates matching my age group, would that be fine? saying 'no' just says you cant book an appointment.
The thought process here is to just get a booking asap but still within the correct dates for my age group.
Saying 'yes' doesn't prompt any additional questions or validation of this claim. Would they ask for proof when arriving at the appointment? Would I get turned away?
Is Sputnik V one of the choices ?
Anyone else have a sinking feeling that many are gaming the system? By claiming to have a disease, etc?
Yet my mother in her 60‚Äôs is having her long pre-scheduled vaccination date pushed/delayed? Umm, okay.
I'm guessing tomorrow that the 50-59 ppl will book all the spots for the next two months... the actual time you will get vaccinated if you are say 30 will probably be end of summer... if you want to get your vaccine on the day of booking you will have to cheat the system and book in advance and lie about it... I'm not saying you should do it but I bet plenty of people will be confused and book too early for a vaccine slot on the day of eligibility of booking and they wont be turned down at the door...
Does that mean we can get the vaccine on those dates or that we can only schedule on those dates for future appointments?
Amazing news!!
So I literally just moved to Montreal from Alberta like two days ago. 
What are the vaccination things I need to know?
R√©pondre en fran√ßais c'est dac.

PCMR is leaking
Wow ! Je ne savais m√™me pas qu'il pouvait illuminer comme √ßa !
I‚Äôve run it over the last couple of weekends. Very quiet and quite beautiful.
Damn on voit tellement bien la [superpoutre](http://superpoutre.ca/) avec ces lumi√®res-l√†!
^^^^^^^/s
Le pont va s'√©crouler en toute splendeur!!
Super photo, good job!
NGL the city got a lot of hate for wasting money on this, but I've driven through it a few times and it was very pleasant.
*ok Google, change the Champlain lights to pink!*
La quantit√© de RGB prouve qu'il est plus rapide √† traverser que le Pont Jacques Cartier.
Looks like my gaming PC.
Rgb light for faster speeds. I love it.
Great shot.
TBH I find it looks nicer when it's less rainbow-ish and more toned down - sometimes it's just blue&greenish and looks so stylish running across the river.
Needs more rgb. You know, for more FPS
Tr√®s pretty

When do they plan to tear it down?

Le meilleur souvenir que j'ai eu cette √©t√©, tripper comme un malade avec des pats pi checker le pont.
En toute honn√™tet√©, je le trouve bien trop illumin√© et brillant... C'est grossier et tapageur. √áa a litt√©ralement autant de subtilit√© qu'un dessous de char de tawouin de saint eustache de 2005, version gigantesque et qui co√ªte plusieurs millions.

^(Je connais le sub pcmr ;))
ASUS ROG Pont Champlain Ti Strix OC 16GB GDDR6
With that many RGBs, it can run Cyberpunk 4 times.
Et imagine en plus tu as pay√© pour!!!
Dans l'univers Marvel, cela s'appellerait Bifrost.
Et c'est pas mal cool aussi de se rendre au point d'observation le plus haut aux pieds des pyl√¥nes en v√©lo.
Fake news, les ampoules vont peter avant
The city didn't spend a dime on this. This bridge was entirely financed by the federal government.
> I've driven through it a few times and it was very pleasant
Exactly.
So tired of people complaining about the slightest amount of money spent on quality of life. Honestly the complaints usually seem to be from people who don't understand the actual projects, but more importantly, life doesn't have to be a fucking drag all the time.
The best part is that the expansion joints are smooth af and 4 lanes
It gonna clear traffic lol.
I'm sure the option to turn the lights off is there, so if it gets to the point no one likes it anymore, they'd probably just do that.
Besides, it's quite lovely to see when you're driving down the Bonaventure.
> K√©taine ou qu√©taine est un adjectif propre au langage populaire qu√©b√©cois et signifie ¬´ qui manque de raffinement ¬ª
Quel est le manque en raffinement? Du point de vue technique, cette photo est raffin√©e √† un point o√π m√™me la couleur de la nuit est imp√©cable.
Bien d'accord! Au moins le PJC a un concept d'√©clairage, pas comme ce pont-l√† ou la grande roue de montr√©al qui est aussi √©clair√©e en RGB mode

Y'a un point d'observation dans les tours?
J'espere yon mis des LED, sinon sa coute chere d'electriciter!
unlike the old one bridge the expansion joints were annoying fuck I hated that bridge
C'est bon √† savoir. Beaucoup ont utilis√© comme argument contre l'interdiction des cal√®ches que ces √™tres merveilleux finiraient par √™tre abattus pour la nourriture pour chiens. Je leur souhaite une bonne retraite!
They look majestic and happy.
They‚Äôre so so beautiful. I wish I had $$ to give you an award. Thank you for taking care of these precious creatures.
What are the personalities of the cal√®che horses like?
Thank you ... I live in the Old Port and watched the "drivers" go down our one way for years. The small street from which our garage exits is a one way as the exit is essentially a completely blind corner. I was dreading the day one of these horses got hit from someone coming out too fast, or the horse coming down the on e-way too fast. Honestly, if someone wants to use horses in our city and not follow basic rules of the road, they should be forced to walk in front of the horse. I would have liked to see if these drivers would still turn head-on into traffic down McGill, or go the wrong way down one ways when forced to be in front of the horse.
\*Yay\* I'm so happy they got the retirement they deserve ‚ù§Ô∏è   Are these Belgian horses?
This warms my heart. Thank you so much for what you do. Also, I'm in the area and been around horses for most of my life...Is there any way I can help?
gorgeous! congrats!
Amazing. Well done. Is there a way to help out?
Funny I was just talking about the former cal√®che horses you care for today! Thanks for the update, happy these two found a home with you!
This is really beautiful to see. These guys are lined up for a gorgeous retirement. 
It was really infuriating when the interest groups threatened to kill all the horses if Montreal banned them. That kind of politics is disgusting. 
You‚Äôre a wonderful person. Have a great life, Zach and Maya.
Beautiful.  They look so happy.
This makes me so happy! Thank you for the work that you do for these horses.
Thank you!!!!!!!!!!
They look happy.
They‚Äôre beautiful ü•∞üòç
They're both really friendly and are slowly being integrated into the herd. They get to run in the pasture but for now it's limited because they just aren't used to it!
My reward is being able to interact with these beautiful animals and share their world. When these Covid measures are over I will definitely post about our open houses that are free. If you're a frontline worker in any capacity, DM me and I'll you info on how to get a visit now.
For the most part they're approachable and really affectionate. Right now these guys are still adjusting to open spaces and get really excited and try to run and buck as soon as we let them into the pasture, and it's not easy controlling them from their paddock to the fields. 2000 lbs of pent up energy takes experience to deal with. And like the others we've rescued they'll get used to the rythm of retirement and more open space to be horses.
These guys no longer have to worry about working or living in that environment! Despite being close to the highway, we're surrounded by trees and other natural noise barriers and the horses don't notice. Rest assured that these guys are living a life that they didn't even know was possible.
Yep. Belgian drafts. We now have 3 Belgian drafts and 3 Percherons! If you ever want to feel humble and small, just stand beside one of these guys and realize how lucky we are that they're gentle giants and trust us.
You can become a volunteer! Ahtrescue.org 
Awesome!
I'll send you a DM. I post these pictures for pleasure and to  inform Montrealers about something they helped to do and where some of the industry horses ended up and let them know their efforts paid off. Thank you for your kind words.
Thank you. And it's a priveledge for me to work with them and enjoy their company.
Thank you. And they're looking even better now!
Please do post after restrictions are lifted. I would love to come see these beauties.
Is this near Rigaud by any chance?
Thank you!!
How long have you had them???
I most certainly will! You can always do a sneak walk by at 27 Chemin Murphy. Just don't feed them!
Not far. Just on the edge of Hudson in Vaudreiul.
They came to us about 5 or 6 weeks ago. They're now being fed appropriate food and being groomed regularly. Farrier was in 3 weeks ago and hoof treatment is under way.
A perfect place for them to retire then. 
Great work!
They‚Äôre in good hands with you ü•∞
It's nice to be able to walk and cantor them as we're on a very rural hidden road. 
Thanks!
Un exemple concret de l'id√©al de vivre en soci√©t√©. J'adore cet √©tablissement.

Be mindful of bedbugs though, I think there aren't any soft fabric couches anymore because of that.
Ce bel √©tablissement rempli de punaises de lits ‚ù§Ô∏è
Its fantastic, its unfortunate how much noise travels within the library however. Conversations had at the reception can be heard as clearly as if theyre right next to you on the third floor.
Belle photo
J'ADORE la Grande Biblioth√®que! ‚ù§Ô∏è
A beautiful establishment, brimming with bedbugs. I got them from there once, and it was 5 months of hell. Finally worked up the nerve to return and witnessed a woman finding herself crawling with them while sitting in the cafe area. I would doubt they've solved the problem even now. The soft chairs are gone, but they can hide anywhere, even in books, so...
Is it open yet?
Also, did they get rid of the bedbugs?
My favourite Sundays in Montr√©al involved taking the metro to this library and browse different books and then take a walk around the neighbourhood. I miss Montr√©al. (PS my commute didn‚Äôt include public transportation so I used to enjoy taking the metro on a Sunday)
Franchement c'est beau comme biblioth√®que
Sadly after the bed bugs plague they changed the comfy couches for plastic chairs.
Yeah this place is an absolute gem. You can rent DVDs, read any magazine, go through archives and it‚Äôs QUIET. Underrated spot

J‚Äôadore cet endroit!
Je la trouve tellement belle.
I studied here when I was an exchange student with HEC Montr√©al! Loved it!
It is open now? Cuz with the pandemic I don‚Äôt know what is open and what is closed and if we are allowed to sit or just to borrow books
Is it free access for everyone and do I need to have a card of some sort? I would love to go spend some time there to read and chill.
Do they really have an extensive collection of euro-comics there? I've heard rumors

I really hope they took the opportunity fumigate for bedbugs while the library was empty.
Pas assez de sans abris
Zaha Hadid submitted a design for this building and Quebec wasn‚Äôt smart enough to go with having a building by one of the worlds foremost architects. Good job!!!! (Not)

Cette personne biblioth√©que.
Can I just go there and study? I imagine I can. Is there free wifi, or do I have first have to subscribe to the library?
Is it open again?
This place gave me a BANQ card, even though I was not Canadian / PR at that time, just a temp resident, a PVT. Even a vehicle registration card was enough for that.
But still. There is something cool with libraries and Canada. If it was  the Meadowvale Library or the Hazel McCallion Central Library in  Mississauga or the big Reference Library in Toronto. Places, where you could spend an eternity a day. In Sauga city, you could also do sports in the same building where the library was located for example. These libraries were my second home in Canada!
What's the kids section like?
I live so close to it now! Thanks for posting this info. I downloaded the App to get a self-guided tour, and will go soon

bonne question
Les chaises de plastiques datent d'avant pand√©mie. Tous les fauteuils ont √©t√© chang√© depuis... ils sont apparemment fait d'un tissus resistant aux punaises.

I am not familiar with the term euro comics but their comic book / graphic novel section is huge. Never had any trouble finding one. 
In the rare case you can't find a book, you can request them to buy it and most of the time they do, unless it's not available in Canada. There is a form on their website.

Sir... This is a Library
Je m'ennuie de mon amour pour la litt√©rature. Quand j'√©tais kid, j'adorais lire. J'ai perdu √ßa au fil des ann√©es, malheureusement.
You have to have your card since you access the WiFi with your ID. It's  a great place to study, I used to go there to study after work.
Yes you can. There is the free MTLWifi, but there is also the wifi of the library itself, you will need to subscribe, but having a card is free so why not
Yes indeed.

Est-ce que c‚Äôest pris avec un appareil photo ou un t√©l√©phone mobile?
Yeah mon quartier.
Dans quelle rue/avenue de Rosemont la photo a-t-elle √©t√© prise svp ?
The street is cool and all but that picture is sharp af! Well done mate!
RTX ON
Nice picture!
There's a certain serenity in this pic, I love it.
Great shot, thanks for posting! I have been living in California for more than 2 years but I miss Montreal even during winter!
La composition est superbe.
Moi c'est dans ces moments l√† que je regrette de pas avoir mon bon appareil avec moi. Les t√©l√©phones appliquent un paquet de d√©bruitage et de sharpening... Et avec une shot comme √ßa c'est toujours la perfectionniste en moi qui se demande "√ßa aurait eu l'air de quoi si..."
C'est quand m√™me une tr√®s belle image.
Ouais vraiment, tr√®s nice photo, bravo. Soon, maybe, I will walk Masson again going to Baptiste, or elsewhere, to delight myself with some local beer. I miss that for sure.
Better than reality!
Nice shot!
Nice picture, when was this ?
Was this taken with an SLR camera or with a smartphone? It looks slick AF!
Man, ray tracing just looks better and better everyday!  
Is your camera equipped with 3080ti focus lens?
C'est si beau quand les nids de poule sont cach√©s comme √ßa
The graphics mod is impressive.

>Surment sur mobile, bas√© sur l'effet HDR qui est d√©sormais par d√©faut sur certain mod√®les
It was taken with a Samsung S10 + Adobe Lightroom
I hope not too many of us uncool people move there and ruin the awesome thing you have going on. Great restaurants, bars (one day again) and walks/rides.
>Dans quelle rue/avenue de Rosemont la photo a-t-elle √©t√© prise svp ?
I think  Avenue De Chateaubriand.
I just punch in a Lightroom preset while on the metro and I'm done for the day.
Thank you!
It was last Wednesday, Feb 3rd when temperatures had climbed back to 0.
Thanks. Taken with a Galaxy S10 and some heavy Lightroom presets applied. "Overkill is underrated".
Just whatever Samsung's S10 phone is equipped with.
I never leave home without my Lightroom presets.
Pretty neat thanks for the answer
That was my first guess! I live nearby and take that street to get to the metro. Well done it's beautiful.
Thanks a lot ! :)
Though it's pretty impressive for a quick touch-up. I already heard some great comments about this app so there's no surprise about its result.  
Once again well done and next time you post a picture count on me for an upvote!
Cheers! I grew up in NDG but I always liked the vibe around plateau/mile end/rosemont
Thanks, i was wondering because of the snowbanks melting.
J'ai la tune d'la p'tite vie qui joue dans ma t√™te quand je regarde ce beau dessin!
You should publish a MTL coloring book, I'd buy it.
That is truly amazing!!! Clearly that is a street in the Plateau. Bloody great work!!!
Bro I'm going to print this and give it to my son to color. Heck Im even going to print me one.
Again with the subtle cone! I love it. I look at this and your other work and admire it. I ask myself why I don't do this. You know the answer? I can't! It's a bunch of lines put into certain places...why can't I just do that? My mind just won't allow me to translate a real image onto paper (or any other medium) despite the fact that it's literally sitting in front of me and not moving. I really appreciate the people like yourself who do this. And adding a certain flair/style is great. Thanks for sharing!
Did you sneak onto my front porch and draw this while I wasn't home?
J‚Äôai des vraies cauchemars ou je dois quitter la
ville, pour un raison ou d‚Äôautre.
As soon as I saw this, I looked for the traffic cone! Your drawings are so full of life.  Love the bike behind the bannister and the cat in the window. üå∑
J‚Äôadore!
Really great drawing!
I love the concept and the lines.
Will you make a coloring book out of those?
I feel like printing this and coloring during boring zooms.
I'm going to print this and colour it in. Amazing work!
This is so beautiful, reminds me so much of the Montr√©al apartments I miss seeing
I love this! Do you do commission work? I am so interested!!!
Why you drawing my front porch?
Saw the pic and immediately thought "this must be Montreal," then saw what sub it was. Well done!
Colour by numbers - Montreal edition!
Chat
Do you sell those in paper so I can put it up my wall?
This is great! Ever think of making a Montreal colouring book? I'd buy one if you did.
Tr√®s beau, mais avec toutes les points de projection diff√©rents, √ßa me donne mal √† la t√™te √† visualiser l'ensemble.
[deleted]
Small (hopefully constructive) criticism: I am not sure if this is done on purpose to give a surreal look but there are multiple inconsistent perspectives in this drawing. The right of the image obeys a single-point perspective, but the sidewalk, cars, and buildings on the other side of the street have a completely different perspective. You have one vanishing point just off-center, and then another one  way up and to the right.  
A similar thing can be seen in your previous drawing, where some objects appear to follow a vanishing point perspective (balconies, railings) while other look like an isometric projections (bay-windows).  
Anyway, I don't want to be too negative; these are some really cool drawings. IMO if you are going for realism, readimng up a little more on perspective theory would help. If you already know about that but are going for a slightly surreal feel, then well done!
WoW so beautiful so Montreal !
[deleted]
The crooked perspectives bring a cool dreamy vibe to the drawing! Love it
Nice one, those circular staircases get really messy and dangerous in the winter with ice and freezing rain. Slipped on one occasion on them.
Always love seeing inkwork (digital and traditional) in this sub! Ink work always makes for great coloring pages, but I got some little critiques and its more about clarity and line weights. Line weight and the differences in size really helps with depth of a pucture as making all the lines 1 size makes it feel quite flat, and when adding in perspective, makes it confusing on the scale of objects.
Im gonna assume this was drawn on a tablet (Ipad/surface/android) and then pen you're using might not have line and pressure sensitivity, which is huge in ink drawings. Try seeing if its a settings issue in the drawing app or if its a pen issue (as cheap styluses do not have pressure sensitivity) along with checking out if the drawing app has line corrective settings like a **Stabilizer**. Clip Studio has this feature and it helps out a ton when I do lineart as I have shaky hands. 
The size of the lines as well gives it a bit more depth when it comes to perspective as you work with the foreground (which would be the condo window on the left) and working your way to the midground then background. The closer it is, the thicker the lines, the farther it is, the smaller the lines. 
And my last one (if the program you se has this feature), make the lineart layer a Vector layer. It makes the line smooth, solid and they can be resized without losing its smoothness or pixelating when its shrunk and then blown back up. Plus it looks good when printed on paper to color over. 
Just my little tips and critique, hope it helps a bit in future art!
Est-ce que c'est du Rotoscoping?
Popa √† d√©j√† sortie le mou!
Merci
Thanks so much!
100% d'accord!
Came here to say exactly this. Cannot upvote enough. I would LOVE to gift a colouring book about montreal to my friends‚Äô kids abroad.
I was thinking Verdun.
Cheers!
Villeray
Haha! Super fun idea.
Thanks! Cones, cats and No parking signs...
There was a guy who did much better drawings of famous places here (Atwater market etc) last year.
That was me stealing your Amazon delivery. Nice choice in charging cables!
Haha, I didn't steal the Amazon package...
Malhareuse, moi aussi..
plateaulife
Thnx!
Merci~
Thanks a lot, someone else just suggested giving his son a print to colour!
Ive done about 30 black and white drawings with pandemic themes but these were the first Montreal-specific ones with an attempt at loose realism. 
I've taken a few hundred photos of the architecture around here and can use some of those as reference for future ones, I guess!
Fun!
I'm reliving fond memories of living on the plateau in the 90s..
Wow I'm flattered! 
I just draw for fun, really, to cope with lockdown life.
If I were to sell art, my sense of professionalism would demand a higher quality... Send me a DM?
My neighbours probably thought that yesterday. ..

Just moved from this apartment building in May. Miss the view but not those elevators!
Look at that bicycle lane, there's no bikes lol! Good job Valerie Plante!
Ouais
Yeah, damn the fact that there‚Äôs no bikes in this split second exposure, which is also very early in the morning!
now it‚Äôs your duty to pay it forward and explain why you are doing so
Use the 50$ he refused in a donation to your favorite cause, that would be a great way to continue the good deed chain!
That's great.
One time on a motorcycle ride, I found a drivers license on the ground in a park. Adress was from the west coast so I figured it would be pointless to ship it there. Found the guy on Facebook and xpresspost it to his place out here.
He wanted to e-transfer me some cash. Asked him to pay it forward instead.
What a very touching story :‚Äô)
I actually lost my wallet back in March, just as COVID was taking over. I remember being so stressed and anxious as everything was closing and wasn‚Äôt sure if I would be able to get everything replaced. My wallet contained all my credit cards as well as my RAMQ health card, so I was super worried as I wasn‚Äôt ready to enter a pandemic without any type of identification nor be able to pay for necessary items online. But in the midsts of all this, I got a knock on my door and was shocked to see my wallet being returned! Definitely had tears in my eyes and thanked this kind stranger. I tried offering a cash reward for his generosity but he refused. 
Though this pandemic has not been easy, I still think about that moment and realize what a great city we live in
Had a similar good samaritan save me this summer. The true sir (also an off-duty cop) refused any reward, and simply wanted to save a stranger from the headache of replacing all ID and cards while away from home. Belief in the common good is still alive! His pro-tip if you ever find a wallet: call the number on the back of a bank or credit card: their lost card departments are super responsive, and were able to coordinate a meetup for us within minutes. (Edit: typo)
At least you're grateful for the gesture.
A couple of years ago one of my kids found a wallet. 
We drove to Ile des Soeurs to return it to the owner.
Get to this big ass house and ring the doorbell. 
A young woman answers the door. We ask if wallet owner lives at this address.
She answers Yeah, it's my brother. 
So we hand her his wallet letting her know he had lost it.
She grabs it, says *What, he lost his wallet again*, goes back inside and shuts the door. No thank you or anything.
We were still happy we brought it back. Losing a wallet has to be one of the worse pains ever.
This is another reason why I immigrated here; Quebecois are awesome!
Hoping there was no shenanigans done with your personal identity infos...
I'ts hard not to be wary of wrongdoings these days.
But there are still some charitable and helpful people in these times.
Terrebonne power !
great story, thanks for sharing :)
It always feels good to help a stranger and sometimes it's the smallest things that makes a difference. A smile can literally change a person's mood for the day.
donc, juste pour bien comprendre, tu pars de Brossard en char, pour aller prendre des marches a Terrebonne... ?
I lost my wallet once downtown. Called my bank to freeze my accounts, and they told me that someone tried to use my credit card in EIGHT different stores. Only had 5$ on my card, so it could have been worse. 
Not sure why they tried more than one stopped working though, like I was gonna magically load it with more money or something.
This was the the first time I was happy to be poor, because the only thing they got away with was getting 3$ worth of McDonald's. Hope you enjoyed your cheeseburger, thief.
In before someone calls you a  "Banlieusard"
I‚Äôm lowkey jealous because I lost/someone stole my wallet a few months ago. I looked everywhere I had been and found nothing. For weeks I hoped someone would find it and return it but nothing. I looked at statistics for how often people return wallets and it was pretty rare. I pretty much lost hope. I‚Äôm happy to see that some people do go out of their way to return it. Losing your wallet is the worst.
I found someone's phone in Las Vegas, I can see why they forgot it, it sort of melded on the blank black panel of the slot machine. I started calling the last contacts on the phone and I was able to reach the husband of the person who lost it and by coincidence, they were also from Canada! I told them I'd ship it to them once I got home and I did, they were so happy. 
It's nice doing good deeds.
A toi de passer le relais !
dans ton cas je comprends. il ne peut communiquer avec toi.  mon frere une fois a touver un cellulaire. le gars l'apelle et mon frere lui dit ok vient le prendre.  le gars a pas voulu, il voulait que mon frere lui livre hahahaa.
What a warm feeling. I wish him the best!
Now he knows where to pick all those PS5s he ordered on your credit cards.
[deleted]
There's is always more good than bad..ignore the news, all they show us is bad news all the time. It's good for there ratings
I would've forced him to take the money, otherwise i would feel guilty, but it's probably just me
Should asked his phone number. People like that are worth keeping around. If only to send them a birthday card or something.
Oh man, this actually brings back some bad memories. 
A couple of years ago, I found a wallet near a playground close to my home. It was filled with IDs and cards but no money, and there were different addresses on the government IDs, but one of them was in my city just a couple streets away. As I was walking my dog I figured he wouldn‚Äôt mind exploring a little more, so I decided to be a good neighbour and bring it back.
I reach the house, it was sometime after noon on a summer day, and a 50 something year old woman opens the door. I explain that I found the wallet and I‚Äôm returning it. She tells me to wait, goes back inside and  comes back with her husband. 
The IDs were all of a woman that was 30ish years old, so I figured they‚Äôre the parents and want to thank me or something. Very wrong!
So I tell them again that I found it near that specific playground and I‚Äôm returning it. Well, the father starts asking me some pretty weird questions in a very antagonistic way, pretty much like in an interrogation. He didn‚Äôt believe that there was no money, he didn‚Äôt believe I just found laying there, etc. 
It seems the woman whose wallet I was returning was indeed their daughter but she had ‚Äúrun from home‚Äù (not really since she was in her thirties), and was also an alcoholic that had taken a very large amount of money from her parents in cash before leaving; and these people were convinced I was in cahoots with her and I was trying to get more money from them or something. Tbh now thinking back on it I‚Äôm not really sure what they thought I was trying to pull or how I would‚Äôve taken more money from them. 
So as I‚Äôm getting interrogated I definitely lost my cool during the conversation. I decided to bail, threw the wallet towards them and started to walk away. Well fat chance of that. The man grabbed me and as I was wrestling his hands away the ducking woman had grabbed the leash and was trying to take my dog. 
At some point one of their neighbours came out, intervened and we all waited for the cops to come, with them constantly accusing me of the most insane shit about their daughter, and just generally trying to instigate.
The cops came, I had to give a statement explain everything again. At some point they tell me about the situation with the daughter and let me go home. Basically an hour of my life lost for trying to be a good guy.
Remarkable.
wait were you the one that put up that sign at like,, cote st luc and (whatever street is across from clanranald)? i saw that sign a while ago but never thought anything of it qwq
LifeProTip: never do this if you found somebody's wallet or phone. I read plenty of stories when people got accused of taking some money from the wallet or cracking phone's screen before returning it. Next thing you know you have to deal with someone angry at you who might be willing to contact the police and ruin your day.
r/thathapened
Who named you Karma Police?
Merci pour le truc.
And what a pain it is! I lost my wallet back in 2007. Idiot me being a new Canadian carried ALL of my important cards in it (yes, my new SIN card included). Never recovered anything. I felt like a dumbass filing the police report because I didn't know any of the numbers. I only filed a police report in case anyone tried to get a credit card under my name.   
Anyway, live and learn!
Wtf is wrong with people
I believe he is honest but thanks for your warning.
But well thanks to Desjardins I have identity theft alert now, and thanks to Canada Post they only deliver mails to community mailbox so nobody can steal my credit card.... lol
Yeah I do that once in a while, usually in the morning, because that park has a special place in my heart (Ile des Moulins) and I like driving on the 440 and 132...
It is possible though I believe he is honest.
Regardless, the credit cards were cancelled before he came over. Well my Amex in my drawer can finally stop hibernate...
they will do it for health insurance cards and drivers liscence but not for a full wallet
Yes.  My son got his lost wallet back that way, minus all cash, weeks after he'd already replaced all his cards.
Never happened to me, I'll keep taking the risk
Force toi au moins pour pas faire de fautes
Arrest this man.
nobody but why not ??the person that returned the wallet didn‚Äôt take the 50 dollars so pay it forward in another way by helping someone else
He was personally appointed by Thom Yorke.
Do you know that you can put notifications in your bank account and credit cards when an amount is withdrawn?  I have notifications for 50$ minimum but you can put for 5$.  That‚Äôs another way to protect your bank and credit cards.
il faut dire "pour NE pas faire de fautes"
He talks in maths
He buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio
He'd put after 8pm ! Ticket this man !
I 100% agree with the idea to pay it forward.  I was more commenting on your tone which sounded more like an order than a suggestion: Do this and explain yourself.
Hey, OP, I'm right here if you want to pay forward... Just saying ... :P
Yeah thanks for your reminder... Will definitely do it too.
Magnifique. Je savais que c'√©tait Montr√©al avant m√™me de voir o√π c'√©tait post√©.
Amazing detail on the brickwork!
Is that a fresh coat of rust reformer on the handrail? Amazing.
Superb! Really captures the Plateau's beauty!

Do you sell prints?

I love this! You brought back a lot of good summer vibes for me. Much love
You really captured the essence of Le Plateau! Beautiful work! :)

I want to get it for my girlfriends room and her birthday is February 4th. Do you think it will be in time?
On te niaise un p'tit peu car tu r√©p√®tes la m√™me chose √† chaque commentaire de gens! Je vais faire un test savoir si tu lis les commentaires : est-ce que tu vends ton art?
Sadly, you missed the tag that says ‚ÄúI want to eat your ass like piri piri chicken‚Äù
Tu as vu seulement un c√¥ne orange! La chance!
The epicenter of murals is St Laurent, between Sherbrooke & Mount Royal. The two streets parallel to St Laurent (Clark & St Dominique) are also very good. Enjoy your stay!
I'm honestly glad you liked it, but this is the absolute worst Montreal's been in 50 years.  Everything's closed, construction everywhere, nobody downtown :(
Montreal is a terrific city. Mile End and the Plateau are filled with amazing street art.
Montreal is the most underrated city in the country. All my friends go to the other side of the world for vacation, I go 6 hours away to Montreal and fall in love with it more everytime
That's why what you have to do right now is stopping Montreal from becoming like Toronto!
You forgot to mention you can pay a years rent for what it would cost you for 1 month in Toronto.ü§£ Did I mention there's a ton of work here too?
Only one cone? I don't think you had the full experience.
Question. Why do Torontonians have such a high regard for Toronto? Everyone I've met including my step brother who lives there claims it's the greatest place on earth. I've been a few times and its crap. No offense
[deleted]
Oh I know just where you were and yeah it's pretty awesome
I think Montreal might be among the most chaotic cities in the developed world. But after a few weeks you realize the chaos is peaceful and part of a creative mindset.
It's true. On almost every corner there's some beautiful mural. I loved it as well. Toronto is a dumpster fire lol.
Malheureusement, l'un des candidats √† la mairie (Denis Coderre) veut transformer Montr√©al en un esp√®ce de Toronto. Il ne faut pas qu'il gagne les √©lections municipales...
Montreal still has a lot of character compared to Toronto which is mostly glass and steel these days.   I remember moving from Montreal to Calgary years ago and people saying ‚Äúwelcome to Canada‚Äù and as far as I was concerned Montreal was far more Canadian than Alberta was as most of their stores and business are American chains compared to Montreal that still have so many local restaurants and such.
I agree, the street art here is quite impressive.
Reminds me, if I visit Toronto again I have to spend time in a more interesting area, maybe where the artists live and I'll find cafes or bars to hang out.
I waited for an appointment around Bloor St (where many European consulates are) and apart from one very nice old church and its small garden I only spotted brand shops and tall high rises I already could spot from the airplane when flying in. :P
If you're still in town there's the Mural Fest still going on.
Here's a map of urban art from the festival 
https://muralfestival.com/festival/dynamic-map/
Ah you yet to see our life version of Mario Kart with all these cones.
Visiting ANY city from Toronto is likely going to be mind-blowing lol
Yepp. Came here 2 months ago for a week vacay and ended up getting an apartment and a job. Do not miss Toronto at all! There is culture here. Toronto is where you go to try and ‚Äúfit in‚Äù lol
Welcome brother, hope you have a great time!
There's a lot more ,so come again!!!
Is that centre street   near charlevoix metro?
But how do you find the roads and the construction
Always and forever 
https://i.imgur.com/VkAKraZ.jpg
Glad that you like it :) There's normally an art fest every summer that is called "Murales" where a whole bunch of artists make those huge beautiful graffitis all week long! Looks great indeed! There are a lot of them all over the place
Are you still in Montreal? If you are and you‚Äôre I to these kind of murals, I have a couple good locations worth visiting :)
Do they still have the massive Anthony Bourdain on the side of a building downtown? That was incredible.
If you loved that stuff, then next time try going to some cool places instead... it'll rock your world.
can you speak french tho
you didn't visit Montreal. you visited the Plateau and Mile-End. It's like going to NY and only visiting hipster Brooklyn
Wow wait  , which corner lmao ?
lmao I can't recall if I came across that tag. Where was it?
Brahahaha
Wait Piri-Piri chicken is a thing? I thought it was just a marketting word St-Hubert made up for their burger with waaaaaay too much slaw on it. 
I gotta get me some.

Indeed. I particularly enjoyed walking. Gives you a lot more time to absorb the scenery around you.
Walking around the plateau is amazing. I like that it's not so busy.
I'm not sure if everything got closed again but I was there in early August and all the restaurants/pubs near Old Port were buzzing with people. It was amazing to watch as I haven't seen this much crowd in Toronto for a long time.
I also visited for the first time recently, and constant construction is an issue in many cities around the world but damn, in Montreal shit is on another level
I'm so used to the worse that I haven't noticed it was already worse.
I guess that goes for any city in the world, the longer time you spent somewhere the more boring it gets.
but I've heard the buildings are so old n bad in quality, filled with bedbugs and shit - any experience of that?
I mean‚Ä¶ Mtl literally has a reputation as a party city all over the world. I wouldn‚Äôt call it underrated.
A couple years ago I was on a trip with a dozen other canadians from all over the country (all in our mid-20s), and every one of them thought of Montreal as a fun party city with great culture, food, fashion, etc.
And DO NOT LET CODERRE WIN. All he wants is more roads and glass towers.
I wish the shootings would stop! Every time I read about a shooting I feel like we are becoming Toronto
Prospective recruiter, is that you?
the trauma is where the experience is at
"sick audience", poor choice of words lol
If I come over with a date will she leave me after the show ? üòÇ
Yep. Good show.
I got a far, far better comedy show than I expected.
Sorry I'm out of the loop.  What is this about?
Just to be clear, tmw night is now tonight? Saturday July 31st? I got the 8pm in Girourd/ndg parc part üòÜ
This looks cosy! Next time we're in Montreal hopefully you'll still being doing this and we will for sure come!
So, Saturday night in Girouard park at 8pm?
Yo spit comedy in 2 languages or?
Much better than the Reddit meetup a few years ago at the shisha place lol
It was a good show.
How long do they last? Just so happens I'll be in the area for a show but it ends at 9 :S
Is there any parking around the park? If there is I'll definitely come!
Is this happening today as in Saturday? Or is it Sunday?
So cool for you all.
i had to move so i couldnt come hopefully next time !
Aw im busy tomorrow, will this be a recurring thing?
Yoooo I'm in NDG....maybe I might pass by
What's happening?
Awh. Wish I was in town for this.
Wait what!? Did I miss a post here about the show :( Le sad.
This show is amazing. Highly recommend.   
See you guys tonight
You guys were great! Good job organizing the show
See you there tomorrow
Attention aux ballons au champ centre droit!
dang missed it im from west island lol...
Away from MTL rn which sucks... Hope you'll have other representations in MTL before the end of summer
I'm taking a trip there from the 6th - 14th, any shows that week?
I'll check this out. My neighborhood!!
So it WAS a comedy show???? Hahahaha I was biking by and that was my guess. Cool!!!
Man if only I wasn't 2 hours away from that park aarhrhh
I'm sure it's fine and all, but what is the current government restriction on this kind of event? Wouldn't want you to get 500+ people and be shut down...
I'm really not trying to be a dick or anything but I'd really like to know why the cops are okay with this, but sooner or later they show up to break up the dj sets in the park every single time.
It was so much fun thank you for being in NDG ‚ù§
wait, redditors actually exist?
Its  not TMR its NDG. Big difference, but still Mtl. Looks like a nice night out!
Are you guys associated with the comedy show in Verdun by chance?
!Remindme 6 days
Lmao I thought the same thing
You a cop?
Dr. Arruda has entered the chat
Kids nowadays
I'm really sorry for your upcoming loss
Me too!
Last week, I posted about the stand up comedy show I host in park Girouard. We had a good turn out and a few people came because they saw my post here.
yeah it's tonight
I believe so
Only English
Thank you!
Until 9:30 ish
You'll find parking on the streets nearby for sure
Reminds me of the nights I had at Annies pub‚Ä¶ Oh boy
Kudos to you on this beautiful picture on this beaitiful evening ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÄ
When I attended McGill, I had my friend at Service Point give me a Mac Campus shuttle sticker just so I could visit Ste. Anne easier. Beautiful shot.

Love biking over there. Nothing quite like sneaking over the bridge to Smoked Meat Pete's for some very awesome smoked meat.

J'ai supprim√© mon commentaire avant de voir ta r√©ponse. Je me disais que la personne trouvait √ßa plus appropri√© de poster √ßa sur la page de Montr√©al, puisqu'il n'y a probablement pas de forum pour le village de Ste-Anne de Bellevue. Je croyais en fait que c'est Ste-Anne de la P√©rade, qui est loin de Montr√©al.
I moved to Vancouver, so I'm way out of the loop!
Nice I walked over there too. I need get out my door sooner I wake early enough for a sunrise.

Upon his death, James McGill, a Scottish Fur Trader, entrepreneur, and member of Montreal's elite society, bequeathed 10,000 pounds and his 46 acre Burnside Estate to the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning (RIAL) with one simple condition: that they use these gifts to found a college in his name within ten years of his death. Today, McGill University stands as Quebec's first English language University, and one of Canada's most respected educational institutions.
J'adore voir comment les tout minuscules arbres ont r√©ussi √† devenir vraiment beaux! Je devais passer par l√† chaque jour pour aller en cours, pendant six ans au total (bac + ma√Ætrise), toujours un beau chemin √† prendre.
Would those be the same trees on both pics?
Nice! J'ai etudie a McGill entre 2015 et 2020, c'est une super universite :)
The quality of roads haven't changed a lot üòÇ
[deleted]
for some reason this picture haunts me
back in the day when only anglos were allowed....
Very cool and very well done
Thanks for putting both pictures up. üëç
It would be interesting to see that same view in fall or spring, without snow and without leaves.
it's the modern news reporting mullet - social media slacktivists in the front, oppressive genocidal patriarchy in the back
This is great. Although just to nitpick a little bit, the "today" photo is a couple of years out of date, because the road leading into campus has been replaced by a pedestrian walkway with nice stone paving and new benches. It's a really nice place to sit on a sunny day.
Still get anxiety looking at this ü•≤
something something about how Mcgill was evil and oppressed quebecers
Where is the mass grave?
fun fact that's still the name that shows up on some official stuff like business registry, taxes for mcgill: Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning
James McGill, a Scottish Fur Trader, entrepreneur, and member of Montreal's elite society and a slave owner*
En fait la partie qui m'a le plus surpris, c'est que les arbres actuels doivent avoir ~50 ans gros max.... Ce qui veut dire qu'ils ont √©t√© plant√©s et ont repouss√© probablement 3 fois depuis la photo de 1859.
I was wondering the same thing, but I doubt it -- pretty sure 150+ year old trees would be a lot bigger
I doubt it. They're about the size of the tree at my parent's house, which is like 20 years old.
There's one in one of the libraries iirc.
Lmfao
Give Legault another mandate and he'll make it that way again. *sigh*

And would urban trees manage to live this long too? I recall someone posted a really great article about city trees on this sub a couple of years ago, they have a tough life.
Pourquoi tu pr√©f√®res qu‚Äôon cache le pass√© esclavagiste de certains individus?
https://www.theonion.com/man-always-gets-little-rush-out-of-telling-people-john-1819578998
Je ne suis pas certain de comprendre le lien. La domination et l‚Äôexploitation √©tait essentielles pour que des hommes comme McGill deviennent aussi riches et puissants au 19i√®me si√®cle; l‚Äôesclavagisme n‚Äô√©tait qu‚Äôune facette de cette domination. √áa me para√Æt plut√¥t bizarre de ne pas le mentionner en fait.
Hell yeah baby, what a win tonight !! 
Go habs go!
I've been here for less than 6 months, I don't understand the scope of what happened tonight, but I'm happy that people are happy.
Fleury played so good for Canadiens, they named a street after him!
It‚Äôs too bad that we‚Äôre still in the late stages of the pandemic. Some people have no idea how hard this town rocks when we‚Äôre in the playoffs. 
It‚Äôs a great time to visit as the ambiance is peak and the girls and boys are all in good moods.

What building are you taking this awesome picture from?

I've never been, but having seen the photos and vids from the city over the past month, I really wanna visit Montreal.
I should work on learning French.

Un gros merci √† Fleury ;)
I've only been here for less than 2 months, but having come from somewhere else in Canada, I can put it into context for you:
Soccer is the most popular sport in the world, but in Canada, it takes a back seat to hockey.  It's our national sport, and most of the best players in the world are from here.
Even though there are many Canadian players who have been on world championship teams, the last Canadian team to win the Stanley Cup was the Montreal Canadiens - in 1992-1993.  Vancouver came close in 2010-2011, but couldn't seal the deal.  So we have arguably the biggest hockey country in the world, with several hockey teams in it, that have not had a championship in almost 30 years.
The 2021 Stanley Cup Playoffs started with the Montreal Canadiens facing their most enduring rival, the Toronto Maple Leafs.  I am not big enough of a soccer fan to really draw a parallel you might understand, but then again, there may not be one like it.  The Leafs vs. The Habs is a rivalry older than the NHL itself, but it's more than that; it was a rivalry among Canada's two largest cities - one almost exclusively anglophone, and the other francophone.  (Yeah, Montreal is bilingual, but to most outsiders this point is lost.)  It was almost a culture war, particularly in the early years of the NHL, where most of the players for the Canadiens were from Quebec.
The Canadiens, in a word, were not supposed to win.  The top-ranked team in their division, the Toronto Maple Leafs were supposed to slaughter the Habs.  All of the sports writers predicted it.  Vegas odds favoured the Leafs heavily.  However, if there's one thing living in Toronto for 30+ years taught me, it's that the Leafs can and WILL choke given the opportunity.  And that's exactly what happened.  The Habs came back from a 3-1 deficit in the best-of-7 series, and won in Game 7.  Then they went on to handily defeat Winnipeg in the 2nd round, 4 games to none.
That brought them to this series, against Vegas.  The Vegas Golden Knights are a recent expansion team, but they have been strong playoff contenders since day one.  They are consistently one of the better teams in the NHL.  The "smart money" is on them.  Yet once again, the Habs have defied the odds and with tonight's win, they are up in the series 2-1.  This was the first home game of the series, and there were fans in attendance.
It's not a series win; that won't happen until the final buzzer rings and the winning team has won 4 games.  However, this is a great leap forward for the Habs, who weren't even supposed to have made it this far.  (They barely made it into the playoffs!)
So now you have the only Canadian team in the playoffs, taking a series lead against a tough opponent, with the entire country's eyes watching.  French, English, or anything else - it doesn't matter now.  The Montreal Canadiens are Canada's team now, and you're going to see a lot of strong emotions surrounding these games, win or lose.  It's an exciting time to be in this city, although I really hope the fans don't go all Vancouver on the city, should things not go the way we are all hoping.
Go Habs go!
Dude i live nearby i've been considering going but i just can't risk it since i'm only 1 dose vaccinated
Without Covid the bell center would be full both for home games and away games and there would still be a huge crowd outside
Tour des canadiens 2 ! From the sky lounge , the picture does not do any justice at all to how it looks
I‚Äôm confused what are you even trying to say?
Pride is in August here.
Tout le monde dites ‚ÄúMerci Marc-Andr√©!‚Äù ü•≥
Another thing to add is that the canadiens reven have a contentious history in montreal itself as up until i think a decade after the nhls creation, the canadiens were a uniquely francophone team to be the rival of the anglophone montreal marroons. the canadiens now have 24 cups, the most of the league. 
the equivalent of this would be the yankees winning after a 30 year drought
Very well explained!!! Kudos to you!!
 But it seems you forgot to mention an additional very important point, the Canadiens (Habs) not only defeated the Golden Knights, but the refs as well who are obviously being bribed to favour Vegas this playoff run.
>  hope the fans don't go all Vancouver 
Actually the Vancouver fans went all Montreal. We have a longer history of destroying downtown after winning a series (or having a star and hero of the people suspended, [the Richard riot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Riot))I actually met my wife as a result of the '08 riot after the Canadiens beat the Bruins.
>Vancouver came close in 2010-2011
Calgary came even closer in 2004, being up 3-2 in the final series and the game being 2-2 late in the third period when this play happened:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFO2y0b5DxE
the play was not reviewed and the goal was not allowed, but it is still one of the most debated play in modern hockey history. Calgary ended up losing the game and the series
Wait, let me get my free award for you.
Edit: There we go. :)
It was in 2011 for Vancouver.
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a real risk of a riot. There‚Äôs more a sense of ¬´¬†we‚Äôre just happy to be here¬†¬ª than anything else. 
Of course, we all have our idiots, but I doubt there will be enough to do more than break a few windows and overturn a couple of cars.
[deleted]
I cried reading this.
And you‚Äôre doing the right thing. I fully expect Montreal‚Äôs case count to slightly increase due to the crowds.
As a photographer I understand your agony
he's prolly attempting comedy
You could hear them "cheering him on" the entire game. ;)
It's funny you mention the drought; every other Canadian team has waited longer, though! ;)
I used to tease Canucks fans when I lived in Vancouver; I'd tell them that they named a movie after the Canucks - they called it the 40 year-old virgin.
Funny [article](https://thebeaverton.com/2021/06/man-gets-away-with-murder-after-eyewitness-turns-out-to-be-nhl-referee/) about the event.
Haha, well, I didn't want to jinx it by bringing that up, but you're correct.  :)
It was in
Thanks, I should have said "2010-2011"
Si on perd √† cause d'un move de marde de la part des arbitres comme hier soir, il y aura une pas pire √©meute.
Whenever enough people gather in montreal and there is enough time to organize to take advantage of it, anarchists will show up.
Huge crowds are gathering outside the Bell Centre to watch the games (home games at least I think) if you‚Äôre comfortable with that
of course, but what i mean by that is that the habs and the yankees are the best of their respective leagues by far in number of championships, sorry i wasnt clearer  :P
Oui. Je n‚Äôai pas pens√© √† un tel √©v√®nement. J‚Äôesp√®re apr√®s hier soir les arbitres ont eu de notification que √ßa ne passera plus.
Caliss. Comme si on avait besoin de √ßa en ce moment au centre-ville.
I would hope us normies keep that shit in check. There‚Äôs nothing political for them in a Habs win and would win them nothing but disdain from the public at large.
Great shot.
Always feel like a tourist in my own city, and I've lived here my whole life.
J'adore la photo (et la place est cool aussi!)
I used to shop there, back when my studio was on St Francois-Xavier.
I once bumped into most of Radiohead, right in front of there.
My actual neighbourhood dep. Shelton beers, good eggs, good milk, bread ... and got my "street closed" and "farine five roses" pillows there.
I miss that shop since I left town!! Used to pop in every few days for coffee and a pastry. Great vibe!
Holly God!!!! I super would like to live at that place. I have been in Montreal in 2012 and I‚Äôm fall in love yet. ü•∞
I love this shop. It's genuinely charming with great products, compared to the sea of kitschy souvenir shops in the area. One of my favourite stops when I hit the Vieux Port
Had many a great creative burst sat along that window during my study exchange last year. An absolutely stunning spot. √Ä la prochaine fois!
My friend manage this place, nice spot!
I love this place
nice pic :)
what gear do you use?
Like this place. It would be great if vieux montreal could instead of horrible overpriced restaurants t shirt and souvenirs to be somewhere good and affordable where locals would like to go
Great little shop...... a bit overpriced.....
[deleted]
Is that place the one ran by 2 women? Close to the clubs?
If it is then I enjoyed it. They couldn't have been nicer. :D

Gorgeous! I loved staying in the Olde Port during the Grand Prix. Such a fun town!
As an American where Bocata was the last place I ate in Montreal pre-pandemic, this makes me miss Montreal deeply.
Amazing!

They must have a deal with the police, since they have been impersonating montreal police officers for almost as long as JFL Gags have existed.
Impersonating a police officer is a crime isnt it? You have all the rights to be angry imo. Might be even dangerous if a situation is going out of control particulary for the actors, you never know on whom you prank.
J'en vois passer assez souvent des gags avec des policiers (toujours les m√™mes acteurs d'ailleurs!), Je suis curieux d'avoir un point de vue l√©gal l√† dessus.
Edit: si vous avez des amis juristes/avocat-es/juges posez leur la question!
They should definitely NOT do police sketches.
Ces "gags" de faux flics m'ont toujours mis mal √† l'aise. Et c'est encore pire si c'est dans un quartier o√π on retrouve une importante population noire. 100% d'accord avec vous!
Je ne sais pas si c'est le bon num√©ro √† contacter pour une plainte dans ce cas-ci, vu que √ßa concerne les gags et non les spectacles, mais:  https://www.hahaha.com/fr/nous-joindre
I'd be pissed too. It's one thing to mess around with people hanging around at the mall or something and another entirely to stop people on the road while impersonating a cop. Somehow I don't think they'd point a fake gun at someone during a prank, but I bet they wore one on their hip without thinking about it.
You have every right to be mad.
Impersonating a police officer is a crime.
You should file a complaint with the police.
This is so fucked up.
They can impersonate police officers and make you late but can‚Äôt give you a number to call to complain if anything. Fuck them. Where exactly was that? Will try to avoid the place.
Impersonating law officials, including police, border control, etc is illegal.  You can call the Montreal Police and make an official complaint.  https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/section-130.html
Je crois que le loophole est que leurs "uniforme" n'est pas celui du SPVM et rien n'est indiqu√© qui pourrait laisser croire qu'ils sont vraiment de la police. L'histoire d'OP prouve le contraire un peu. Et je suis un peu (beaucoup) choqu√©e qu'ils aient pris le temps d'arr√™ter la voiture et de faire sortir OP... J'ai d√©j√† eu √† dealer avec eux et bien que z√©ro autant traumatisant, j'√©tais en beau calvaire aussi.
You're not over-reacting. It's fucked up that they would think something like that is acceptable (let alone legal).
You're not overreacting. Fuck them! They used to run their stupid pranks on my street non stop. It's either shit like that or poking fun at people with disabilities. I don't know how they sleep at night.

Ben d'accord avec toi. C'√©tait peut-√™tre dr√¥le dans le temps o√π on parlait pas de racisme et de brutalit√© polici√®re aussi souvent dans notre soci√©t√© mais aujourd'hui c'est vraiment de mauvais go√ªt.
Call the non-emergency police number and report them, impersonating a police officer is a crime.
J‚Äôesp√®re que √ßa a pas trop perturb√© ta journ√©e. 
J‚Äôimagine quelqu‚Äôun qui se rend √† son entrevue de job ou autre √©v√®nement au timing sensible et qui manque sa shot parce que des faux policiers lui ont fait perdre tout le temps d‚Äôarriver en avance. Ark.
Tu fais vraiment bien d‚Äô√™tre f√¢ch√©, if everybody just smile and wave they will keep doing it.
No matter anybody's personal opinion on that specific subject, there's something really clear for me here:
**You asked to talk to someone to complain, and they didn't let you.** 
It doesn't matter here if you were right or wrong about why you were upset, *they are 100% wrong to not have let you voice your concerns to a designated person*.
That is plain and simply wrong, and talks a lot more of their arrogance than anything else - anything else could have been an "honest mistake" as far as my humble judgement can go. Not letting complaints in? There's no "honest" mistake here.
It's not like recently a man went a shooting spree dressed as a cop.
Let's not add any confusion. Cops are cops. Let's leave it that way.
You have every right to be mad, I‚Äôm so sorry this happened!
S√©rieux leurs esti de gags c genre la chose la plus cringe pis plate ever.
Sue them. Going around in a police officer outfit is walking on legal eggshells. But they plain out used their perceived authority to stop your car, they even pretended to give you a ticket.
This is unnacceptable because it harms the trust between citizens and the police.
It's the same reason why a security agent can't pretend to have the same power as a police officer, if he does, he can loose his right to practice as a security agent.
Sue, they will most likely agree to some kind of reparations.
This is a great post because most of us have watched JFL gags with the police officers and had a good laugh, yet everyone wonders how they get away with impersonating them. It's crazy that you actually experienced it and had exactly the bad experience we all wondered about. It sucks that you had to go through that, and it's perhaps time for them to finally retire that gag.
Who here watches Gags?I thought humor upgraded in the last 20 years. Most of those jokes are just lame and fake.
Either the "lighten up" crowd is the 0,01% of population priviledged enough to not know how it feels to waste time when you have to get somewhere, or you guys are huge hypocrites who would probably have a much worse reaction to this kind of thing than OP did. 
Personnally, there's one thing I really hate: wasting time for no good reason. I don't think JFL Gags are funny, but if someone tries to burden me with their dog before they dissapear, I can refuse to engage and keep going. If police officers pull me over, I HAVE to engage. I'd bet most of the "lighten up" crowd has been in a hurry before, and would absolutely lose it if stopped in these circumstances by FAKE officers for a FAKE reason, while wasting REAL time without any form of consent or knowledge of the situation at hand.
You are not overreacting. You are totally justified.
Knowing myself, I would be just as pissed as you.
Cops terrify me. I am a white female citizen who abides by the law. Once, many years ago, I was driving on the 40 and, unbeknownst by me, the air in the tire was low. A man in an unmarked car kept following me and signalling me to pull over. This went on for a while because I did not know who this man was and did not want to obey him. Finally I pulled over, he informed me about the tire, escorted me off the highway, and we went to the nearest gas station so I could fill the tire with air. He asked me why I wasn‚Äôt cooperating on the highway. I said I have no idea who you are. You do not have a uniform of any kind on your person and your car tells me nothing. Everything was fine in the end, but I really don‚Äôt understand why the cop (highway patrol) who looked like he just got out a bed thinks that he can stop women in an unmarked car. The arrogance of this astounds me. If the cops don‚Äôt know it yet, a lot of people here just don‚Äôt have confidence that these guys aren‚Äôt just a bunch of cowboys. In fact, for years, because of labour negotiations, they used the pressure tactic of not wearing their uniforms properly. Cops should behave professionally with the public. This means identifying themselves properly and treating people of all colours and genders with respect. That is not what I see here. If I had been the OP in this situation, I too would be upset. I don‚Äôt even know how it is legal to impersonate a cop and then use that assumed authority to pull people over. This gag should be stopped because it is way too insensitive to the people of this province who are literally afraid of the police here and for good reason.
I would like to congratulate everyone who tells OP to "lighten up, it's just a joke" on providing succinct examples of [gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting).
I think it's reasonable you talk with a lawyer in regards to filing a criminal complaint and a civil suit in this regards.
Where did this happen?
I'm pretty sure that on the legal side of the impersonations, the Lawyers of Just For Laugh already got on the story, made sure that it is legal, what they actually is that they already tell the SPVM ahead of the filming day, and the SPVM sends real officers near the set in case of a real emergency. Now I'm not saying it is okay to do it, but when it comes to a production, there is a loophole in the law that makes it OK to do. Still stupid
Pas vraiment rapport avec le post, mais quand ils filment, vu que c'est en public, est-ce que t'as le droit de juste rester autour et faire du bruit pendant qu'ils filment? Ou passer sur le set?
√áa serait le fun de les faire chier pis se mettre devant leur cam√©ra pendant qu'ils filment.
i do think gags are funny, but only when the people are ok with it. the question should not be if you‚Äôre overreacting or not. if you found it offensive, the joke isn‚Äôt funny anymore to watch and therefore it shouldn‚Äôt really be. and i completely agree with you that impersonating an officer is very touchy, they should explore other contexts
You're 100% right and it's illegal to impersonate a police officer.
I was gagged on JFL but no police were involved.
You're not overreacting. It's a terrible prank and I'm pretty sure it's actually illegal to impersonate a cop.
I remember one where they switched out free ice cream last minute for margarine. Stick to those gags la police ce n'est pas un joke. Wait actually...
PREACH. This shit has always been unacceptable. These days it's so insensitive that hopefully it will finally get shut down.
Good on you for complaining. I'd love to have an opportunity to tell them how boring they are.
L'affaire l√†-dedans qui me surprend le plus c'est que √ßa marche encore c't'esti d'√©mission l√†. C'est cringe au bout, √ßa pas fait rire personne depuis 93. C'est qui le public cible? Les gens qui peuvent pas changer de poste? Genre salle d'attente, a√©roport, chambre de torture?
Moi qui pensait avoir eu une journ√©e de marde.  Hey boy. Pas facile la vie.
J'ai toujours trouv√© √ßa √©trange qu'ils avaient droit d'aborder des gens dans la rue en √©tant habill√© exactement comme la SPVM et m√™me parfois avec des voitures de la police... 
J'ai toujours eu cette situation o√π quelqu'un dans le besoin accourt vers eux en pensant que c'est des vrai policiers. Et c'est clairement pas comme un tournage ou c'est d√©limit√© et avec tout l'√©quipement et le staff. Dans ce cas-ci, ils se cachent.
Yeah, I always wondered how many pissed off people they get before the funny ones.
Impersonating the police is not OK. It's insensitive in this era of increased awareness.
I would also be screaming mad if I was pulled over by a joke film crew in the middle of a busy day.
Je me rappelle d'une fille qui avait fait un post sur Facebook √† propos des gags JPR, elle s'√©tait sentie vraiment pas bien car la joke √©tait carr√©ment du harc√®lement sexuel. Bref, moi j'√©crirais un courriel √† tout ce beau monde ici : https://www.justepourrire.com/productions-tele/notre-equipe
Wow fuck that, I'd have been really stressed in your position. You're totally within your right to be angry and you should (in my opinion) try to open a file with the police because you felt detained by \*fake police officers with fake guns\*
Sorry to hear you had a bad experience. Maybe JFL need to rethink which gags are appropriate.
If anyone has a problem with these JFL gags I think it's important to know who to complain to. It's the city and the SPVM, not JFL. If it's allowed, a private entity will do it.
It's ridiculous how many people here think that an organization as big and old as JFL is openly doing something illegal. Obviously there is some agreement between them and the city. Lots of armchair lawyers here feeling smart because they can Google and copy paste. Lots.
I've always been disgusted with JPR Gags because of their love of impersonating cops (frightening and intimidating people as a prank while also perpetuating the myth that cops are our friends? Get fucked.) but i had no idea they went so far as to pull people over. That's fucking despicable. I'm so sorry you experienced this, and i'm glad you complained.
Fuck "Gags" and oh, fuck cops while we're at it.
Great post thank you
Hey, I'd hate to be "that person" but are you positive this was Just For Laughs and not some sort of scam/robbery attempt? I've been "pranked" by Just For Laughs before and they had me sign a waiver before recording and gave me a copy with phone numbers of the director on set that day.
Plus, I've worked in the film industry and ALWAYS was required to get consent from every individual who's face was on camera even if it was just a passerby. What they did sounds super illegal to me.
I've worked on set for JFL once (but not on a gag) and frankly they are cunts. Never worked for them again and never will.  
I'd looooooove for this story to hit the media !
Someone asked: how is the neighbourhood relevant? The neighbourhood is one with a concentration of a visible minority. My guess is the gag is much more funny when you do it with a visible minority. You get to see the whole range of emotions from terror to extreme relief. This makes the audience laugh more. In other words, JFL deliberately chooses an area like this because they will get a better result with the gag when doing it in an area with visible minorities because, due to this community‚Äôs fear of the police, the emotional reactions are likely to be more extreme.
About 5 years ago I was minding my business shopping at Rona in Brossard when some lady walked in front of me, took something from a shelf and put it in her purse, and told me if I said anything she'd say I touched her... So I obviously get very uncomfortable, I tell a Rona rep who was helping me out and just just returned after stepping away for a second. She said it was for some tv show. A few minutes later some morons run out trying to get me to sign a waiver. It was for Les Destestable I think. I told them no. So a few minutes again another moron comes out pleading me to sign cuz my reaction was so funny. I said no again but he wouldn't stop so I just signed it to make him go away (I regret that). I came close to getting the manager out asking them why the fuck they let this stupid TV show pull this stupid prank but I would have caused quite the scene so I just walked out. Fuck that stupid TV show and whatever idiots thought a sexual harassment prank would be funny.
NDG best hood!
Nice!!! Love to see my neighbourhood!
Thanks for the great photo, can I guess taken from Walkley looking down Sherbrooke?
Love my NDG!
Magnifique et merveilleux!
Great picture i really like the contrast and the flow
√áa ressemble √† la Floride mais ob√®se
You can head down to cafe 92 after for a coffee and croissant! Love that place. Nice pic!
stunning! 
bad weather coming!
It seriously is the best hood I find. Comparing it to other parts of town, its just refreshing to see that it is not getting as gentrified as the other neighbourhoods.
Thank you that's really nice. It was on Mariette looking east on Sherbrooke.
Yeah, was going to say a couple of blocks west of Cavendish. Recognized that big apartment building from a couple of years living right around there years back.
Thanks so much, that's really nice.
Came here to say something like this.
Maybe not as gentrified cause of the lack of space and history but sure is cleaned up a whole lot more than other neighborhoods.
you sure its not montclair looking east on sherbrooke ?
Same! Actually lived in that building on 7th floor. View is great but dont make the mistake of taking an appartment on sherbrooke or cavendish side. There is so much noise, its insane. People are honking like it is new york (not sure why tbh), police, ambulance and firetrucks sirens feel like they're inside your appartment, and also the fire alarm just keeps going off for no reason. As someone who experienced a real fire situation, it baffled me to see people casually walking UP the stairs with a fire alarm blaring. But when alarm rings 5 times in the same week, in the middle of the night, I start to get it (always went outside myself though, just in case).
Anyway, view is great and lots of great places to go walk nearby. Loved it despite the noise !
Same here. Fond memories as all my years in No Damm Good were some of the best years of my life.
absolument
Quite sure. I was at a buddy's who lives on Mariette and we were walking to the couche-tard at the corner of the street. It looks like its a couple of streets up in the photo cause I zoomed in quite a bit so that the colors of the sky take up most of the frame.

Hairdressing schools are often the victims of "which volunteers will show up at the front desk".
I remember volunteering to sit on the chair for one of my friend's exam. I have to admit I was quite nervous I'd end up balled).
We have to invite black Quebecois to volunteer so student hairstylists can build experience.
Most of the time when a hairstylist tell you "sorry I don't do that cut", it is because they are afraid of fucking up, having an angry customer and hurting the salon's image.
So they need the practice.
Great idea! Expending one's knowledge is always the way to go.
There's a lot of money to be made if you have the skills to do black hair. My best friend does black hair and her services are in great demand. At one point, she had so many clients that she had to refer them to other hairdressers. She now divides her time between Montreal and Vancouver and works with wealthy executive types, athletes, and Hollywood celebrities that are in town to shoot movies. Sometimes the celebrities fly her out to their location, all-expenses paid.
hmmm on the one hand I agree but on the other isn't having black hair stylists good for the community in the sense that black hairdressers (who study black hair) have stable jobs because the others won't do it? It kind of keeps black dollars within the black community organically. But I'm not black, I'm just curious if other black people might feel that way as well.
I mean this should have been done a long time ago but this is great and should be mandatory.
Most of them can barely deal with curly hair, let alone black hairüôÑ
They should include Asian hair as well. It's usually thicker hair, very hard to find a hairdresser that knows how to handle them in Mtl.
Pourquoi pas ... 
√áa doit √™tre cool d'apprendre des nouvelles techniques....
If we're talking about schools that are publicly funded then fine, but where will all these black hair teachers come from, especially in the rural areas where white people are 98% of the population?
Probably the better solution is to have government assistance available to help establish schools that specialise in black hair in places that make economic sense. 
What about Asian hair?
This is wonderful! I hope they do it.
You know who might not like this?  Owners of barbershops and salons that exclusively cater to this type of hair.  If every place can do it, the niche barbershops might go under.
Try going to a black hairdresser as a white person and you will see quickly that discrimination goes both way. I truly wish it wasn't like that but I'm not gonna lie just to get upvotes.
The important word here is "required", why? Your only hurting small businesses. If there is demand for something someone will fill it no need for regulation.
Working towards equality, one fade at a time!
I have nothing to contribute on this one but this comment section is considerably more polarized than I expected.
What about Aborigines hair skills ? And Balds ?
wouldn‚Äôt it be great business to have a skill in high demand instead?
Absolutely!!
[deleted]
Putting aside the valid social issue, the owner of a hair salon went to another hair salon where she was frustrated when she was told they were unable to style her hair. What?   
(It reads like she was refused service, but maybe she was just asking hypothetically...)
Cue the people claiming it's cultural appropriation.

I had to "Fight" and get reckonized before she decided to serve me. Same shit chez Raoul design. When i wasnt ignore i would get higher prices. Just to dissuade me to go there. Caus ya know, its for black. Not for unapproved whitey. Racism is real. And it doesnt only go one way. This is the point of my post. I call bullshit on one sided racism. To think it actually is, for me, means you havent been/lived with them enough. Or else you'd know i aint bullshitting.
I still love ya'll! Just stop being naive and taking all the BS.
P.S. In the end she loved me so much that she would feed me for free. But i had to fight for it.
P.P.S. Downvote me back to China. IDK. I'm still speaking the truth.
Hairdressing is a business. People are in the business to make money. If it was profitable they would already offer the service. If it's not then it's unethical to tell these people that they must do something just to please a certain group of people. In the other hand unsatisfied demand is a wet dream of every businessman so if it's really the case then they should go and open that business to make some sweet $$ instead of telling others what to do.
Then i also expect black barber shop to welcome me in open arms and not look at me like i dont belong and pass 3 newer client before me. And know what to do with my hair. Aight??
This isn‚Äôt entirely true. Most of hairdressing school is practicing on mannequins and learning hair cutting, colouring and styling techniques. Practicing on real people happens only for exams and at the very end of the program. 
Unfortunately, hairdressing schools don‚Äôt cover curly hair in any form, except rolling a perm, which very few people do anymore. The only thing we were taught to do with curly hair was straighten it and then cut. Cutting and styling Black hair is completely ignored. If we‚Äôd had a Black woman show up to have her hair done at my school, I‚Äôm not even sure my teacher would have known what to do.
Wigs made of real hair are a good way to practice too
True, plus it's not only black people who have very curly hair so no matter where you plan to open your salon this is knowledge that will come in handy.
Put a smile on me face, it's a win for everyone except the salty.
Yes but that can be their choice to seek out black hairstylists to support them. We should also make sure that black hairstylists aren't being discriminated against in being able to own hair salons or get jobs. But other than that, every stylist should know how to do this so that it gives black people the option to choose, especially if they live in an area where they can't get to a black hairdresser in the first place. They shouldn't be forced every time to specifically have to seek out black people that specialize in black hair.
You‚Äôre not wrong, but there aren‚Äôt any specialized black hairdressing schools, at least not in mtl. This means that Black hairstylists go to school and  learn nothing about their future clientele. There‚Äôs a meme going around the curly hair community that says ‚Äúwhy do I know how to do your hair, but you don‚Äôt know how to do mine.‚Äù It‚Äôs an unequal situation. Additionally, because more Black people than ever are wearing their hair natural instead of in extensions or chemically straightened, the Black hairdressers who learn by apprenticing don‚Äôt have the education on how to cut, style and care for their natural curls. This is why Nancy‚Äôs petition is so important. 
Another fact is that there are so many more hair salons that cater to a white people than Black people. Additionally, there are very few high end salons that cater to natural curls, meaning Black
people aren‚Äôt able to pamper themselves in the same way white people are. 
Introducing curly hair education will encourage Black stylists to go to hairdressing school and open luxurious spaces that cater to Black people.
Many black hairstylists do it as a side job as black hair, in general, depending on your hairstyle and so forth, does not have to be done often. Individuals are now utilizing youtube videos and their self-thought knowledge to do their hair.
The main reason Montreal or Quebec may be lacking in this department is that the black community is shrinking in the province, and now cities like Edmonton are becoming the new hub. Of course, Toronto is so much better at finding black hairstylists, so there are many play variables here.
In general, Quebec is very much a province where there isn't a lot of cultural knowledge mixed in among people, and I do not mean the individuals that say they have one jamaican or Nigerian friend or grew up around Haitians.
I mean people who genuinely have cultural knowledge and are open to exchanging knowledge between various ethnic communities as people live within enclaves here, so no surprise that there isn't a mix of people with practical experience in different hair.
So there are so many variables at play here that I have observed throughout the years.

Yes! You‚Äôre absolutely right. That‚Äôs not what this petition is about, but I agree with what you‚Äôre saying.
So we have to wait until there are enough of us that someone will open up a shop that can handle our hair? And how many is enough? I live in a town with 20,000 people and there is one lady who I trust to do my hair and it took me 8 years to find her.
How do you define Indigenous hair?
The market balances itself. No demand, no supply.
wait... what?  Les √©coles de coiffures au DEP devraient enseigner des comp√©tences de cuisines aux √©tudiants?  Je ne vois vraiment pas le lien que tu essaies de faire.
Aussi, c'est un peu insultant pour tous les gens pour qui les macaroni c'est le repas pr√©f√©r√© :(
This happens. Stylists who are unfamiliar with Black hair will refuse to style it. There's stories of Black actresses told to show up on set with their hair already styled, because they don't have a hair or makeup person who knows Black hair well enough.
Yeah lol that's weird
thats two seperate issues though. lack of knowing how to do it vs actively discriminating against customers. no one is saying its right to discriminate, just that students should be learning all relevant skills
By experience I know you speak the truth right here
Downvoting facts you dont like to make it go away, reddit's favorite circle jerk. Feel sorry for you.
My best friend does black hair and her services are in great demand. At one point she had so many clients that she had to refer them to other hairdressers. Now she mainly focuses on wealthy clients, athletes, and celebrities. Some of the celebrities even fly her out to their film locations, all-expenses paid. There's a lot of money to be made if you have the skills to do black hair.
won‚Äôt they make more money if they can give a service to more clients?
the goal here would be to teach the skill to students in the first place. your argument is moot
As someone who does curly hair (white and black) I assure you that‚Äôs it‚Äôs profitable. Montreal is just behind the times.
White guy here, I get my hair cut at a black barber shop, maybe you just have a bad attitude.
preach
You have so many more options to go somewhere else. 
Why in the world would a white guy walk into a black barber shop?
Is this on Cartier, north of Masson before the track?  If so I use to live in one of those appartment appartment 30 years ago!

I miss Montreal. Saw this and instantly knew it was Montreal. Thank you for this
I like the subtle cones!
Without seeing any description, knew it was Montreal
Looks so much like my old place on saint urbain
I wish that we were able to build new neighborhoods in this style.
I like it. 
Nice work
Nice drawing! I work in Montr√©al for the STM so I drive with these buildings every day as my scenery. Very nice indeed!
This drawing made me smile. ‚ô•Ô∏è Montreal
Love Montr√©al. Miss it. Would love to go back and live there for a summer. It's just magique
beautiful! I can't wait to be back after the summer. I miss the buildings just something that Vancouver will never have.
I saw this and thought, oh, this looks like my place! Then I remembered it vaguely looks like a thousand places in Montreal. Very good capturing of the essence of the city
Love the drawing! ‚ù§Ô∏èMontreal
is it on Pie-IX ?
The orange traffic cone should be the official symbol of my Montreal.
Wow. Exactly.!!!!
An orange cat named Moustache lives there now, I believe..
A true montrealer.
Impressive!
WoW that‚Äôs some vivid memories!
The traffic cones were a dead giveaway.
They have a life of their own!
Thanks! 
There was a guy here last year doing better renderings of all sorts of spots beside their front porch...
Thanks!
Moved back here from Vancouver and feel the same!
It IS someone's old place!
No but purplx recognized the exact building!
Have you seen #fcknomtll on Instagram?
I love this small world situation, and I love Moustache paying his own rent
There was an older man named  monsieur Gallant living on the ground floor on the building on the left beside the commercial building. We spent three good years there. Good memories.
I did live there for three years. It sticks with you.  As I said I have very fond memory of that place and that time in my life.
Montreal's Spiritual Animal
Yes, mine!
I met some people randomly at the Cambie in Nanaimo who once lived in my East Van apartment....
Pourquoi on peut faire √ßa, mais pas inviter dans amis dans sa cour?
why are people still pretending like outdoor transmission is a significant driver of the pandemic??
you know covid and other season viruses don't look at the calendar and decide to be less dangerous in the summer, they spread less precisely bc of factors like spending more time outside
Because there's legit nothing else to do yo
C'etait la meme a parc Laurier, etc.
The curfews not gonna last after St Jean
not surprised anymore... I can't blame them, all of this is hard for mental health.
Amazing! Happy to see everyone getting some Vitamin D and socializing outside!
Avec les b√©cosses bleues qui d√©bordent √† partir de midi! Pro tip: faut aller aux toilettes derri√®re le poste de police!
√áa fait presque vingt ans que je reste sur Villeray pas loin du parc c'est pas la premi√®re fois que le parc est plein, mais cette ann√©e c'est la premi√®re fois qu'il y a un tel mouvement de foule sur la rue Villeray entre 8h30 et 9h30. Le tournois de tennis am√®ne des centaines de banlieusards en voiture qui se cherche un parking en stressant dans les sens-unique, la COVID et le couvre-feu transforme ma rue en "sortie des bars"; plein de monde saoul qui gueule en marchant vers le m√©tro. On se croirait sur saint-laurent ou dans le mcgill ghetto durant le frosh week.
Good for them! Get out and enjoy the weather.
Le montant de vidanges ce matin √©tait absurde en plus. Cibole d'enfants, je vous jure.
It's fine being at the park, but do people really have like 50 friends to all get together in a giant moshpit-like vibe? 
I was there yesterday and OP's pic doesn't do it justice. Felt like a bunch of CEGEP groups getting together. C'est ridicule, genre c'est normale d'etre en groupe, mais genre 30-50?
What do you expect? People to keep locking themselves up just because we have 2 deaths from covid? Are you for real?
Someone never went to a coachella party lol
Genre il fait beau, toulemonde est dehors, le monde ce fait vacciner, alors pourquoi y'avait t'il un autre de crisse de parade anti mask? (Je sais il avait un protest de soutien pour les Palestiniens, mais j'ai vu qu'il avait aussi un manif anti mask). 
Life is pretty good now in considering the year we've had, why are these people still banging on about the regulations. Like these people will go to see their friends in the park to do a bbq and then in the same breath complain that their rights are being infringed lmfao fucking losers.
C'est quoi l'attroupement de 100 personnes qu'on voit dans le haut de la photo?  
Que font tous ces gens ensemble?  Quelle activit√©?
Jeanne-Mance was even crazier! The city is waking up!
Oh man, if only I had friends
Je suis pass√© hier soir vers 21h. D√©chets partout, musique trop forte et gens saouls. c'√©tait pas beau beau...
Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if mtl took this as an opportunity to divert some festival activities to the parks... I know this wouldn‚Äôt drive people to businesses but man do I love a concert on the grass!
Westmount park today as well. But you can‚Äôt catch it easily outdoors and most people have at least 1 shot.
Lol, do you even know what Coachella is?
Mais les abbatoirs et les usines de M. Doug Ford qui fabriquent les p'tits autocollants de distanciation qu'on trouve dans les magasins, faut que √ßa demeure ouvert.   
m'en crisse des gens dans un parc, √† moins que c'est un troupeau de jeunes pis leurs grand-parents, that's not where the transmission is happening.
I've got a feeling it's only a matter of time before the cricket players lose their field just like the softball players at Jeanne-Mance.
Le parc a la riviere des prairies etait aussi rempli.
Et moi je reste chez nous pour limiter les contacts en me disant que ca permet d‚Äôam√©liorer la situation‚Ä¶ useless
Those are longggg shadows.
Not worthy of it's own post because I can't take a none-blurry panorama. This friday at park Lafontaine: 
https://imgur.com/FndPrc2
Jeanne Mance was worst yesterday...so much so that the popos had to come and run their siren for 15-20 min to disperse the crowds.
I dunno about COVID, but at least one person caught an STI (aka STD) that evening.
C'est la m√™me chose depuis un mois quasiment. La police passe faire coucou sans rien faire de plus. Les autres beaux moments c'est les loooongues file devant les toilettes de chantier du parc. On est dans la derni√®re ligne droite et ces attroupements nous promets 3 autres tour de piste
Daaamn I used to live there
On √©tait les trois gars avec des jumelles, une couverture pis du chocolat juste √† droite de ton cadrage, t'aurais d√ª nous mettre dans photo big. Si jme fie au soleil on √©tait l√† drette au moment o√π t'as pris la photo
Awesome.
are you complaining about groups of friends minding their own business in a public outdoor space?
Also, have you ever been to a festival? I don't see the problem with any of this picture. Let people enjoy themselves without judging.
I was there about 3 weeks ago and people were drinking alcohol straight from the bottle. It‚Äôs scary
Idiots

C‚Äôest connu, le coronavirus se tient dans les cours arri√®res.
Tu peux inviter un ami dans ta cour, faut simplement "not get caught".
Tout le monde le fait d√©j√†. Attend pas la permission de Legault.
T'es pas suppos√© faire √ßa non plus, √† moins de respecter les consignes suivantes:  
Contact-free sports and recreational activities are permitted outdoors in public places with members of the same household or in groups of up to 8 people from different households.  
Face covers are always mandatory during outdoor activities, except when:  
the occupants of the same residence engage in the activity, in addition to a single individual with the latter‚Äôs children, thereby forming a stable group, such as a couple that does not reside at the same address;  
the participants from different residences remain a minimum of 2 metres apart throughout the activity;  
the individuals are seated more than 2 metres apart;  
the individuals engage in swimming or water sports.  
Individuals from different residences must always remain 2 metres apart.
L'argument a √©t√© que √ßa commence dans la cour, en toutes bonnes intentions, ensuite certains rentrent et on ne fait plus attention. En tout cas, comme dit l'autre redditor, tout le monde le fait, faut juste pas se faire remarquer/d√©noncer par ses voisins.
Quand ton ami entre chier pendant 20 minutes a browser son cell, ta toilette devient un super spreader
Parce que les gens font probablement moins attention √† la distanciation quand ils sont tous chez un ami √† la m√™me table en train de se passer le ketchup et la moutarde pour leurs hot-dogs.
that group of people in the middle should all get ticketed
Because you have people who don‚Äôt understand risk. The chance of getting it from outdoors is negligible. Some people see the outdoors as a threat with virus particules circling endlessly through the air.
...the sunlight and the heat decrease its lifespan and the more humid air saturates it, winter it may persist outdoors although this is just based on studies of indoor hockey rinks where there is much less light exposure.
Also the virus likes the cold. 
I think outdoors is better but it's not magically amazing. I mean someone sneezes or coughs and a gust of wind can take that bad boy for sure. 
It's just that outdoors is better than indoors. It's not covid proof by any means. 
Gatherings like these could very well increase transmission, and curfew may get lowered again if hospitals fill up.
We'll see I guess.
üêë that‚Äôs why
I biked passed Jeanne-Mance earlier this week, at about 8pm, looked like Miami Beach, I couldn't 'understand it, so many kids out. I've never seen that before.   
And then I realized it's because normally, these crowds would have be spread out over about a half dozen bars across the city. And not in a parc. And it was surreal.  
There literally is nothing else to do.
What's with the English signs?
Big moment in my childhood was going to the Paramount Cinema (now Scotia bank) and passing by that place. I couldn't believe such a thing was allowed to exist in plain sight.
Now that's fine art, love it!
You took a little liberty with the signage üòâ
Le plus triste pour moi est que le five guys est br√ªle aussi :(
You are officially awesome.
Woow beau travaille
The real tragedy is the Five Guys being closed...
Good picture,  good job. Truly a sad day part of my youth went up in flames. üî•üî•
Super sexE
Great job!
[Neighbours are all restos but the sexe was too hot!! rip 5guys](https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MicrosoftTeams-image-11-1.jpg?w=2000)
Gotta have cones.
Je viens pas de Montr√©al, quelqu'un peut m'expliquer?
Cool drawing! Do you do custom work?
Where's the 5 Guys? The real tragedy! /jk
I think I was, there maybe thirty five years ago. 
Its a shame üòî
i need that supersex sign for my room!
Disappointed I never bought a shirt from there lol
Awesome!
Wait when did it burn down and how?
Loved supersex strip club when I was 18. Been closed for so long and now it‚Äôs burnt as well!
I have such a cool story behind that fire, not related to the fire, but right before it happened
THE MONTREAL POLICE DEPARTMENT
SPVM
i chuckled
C'est √ßa la trag√©die
I guess Im still a bit nostalgic for st cath in the 60s lol
Of course, *of course*, that is what would be focused on in this sub.
Same thing and I loved it
Thank you!
Dans la vraie vie, jamais y'aurait une annonce √† Montr√©al avec un num√©ro 450!
y'en a d'autres
Mr. Steer right next door bruh. Local beats chains every time.
I think 5 Guys just had water damage. Hard to tell with it all boarded up though. Even if it were not damaged at all, the stink from next door would be terrible for business.
Damn, they went down as well? I loved ubering food from them before I moved outside their delivery radius.
Merci :)
Un fameux strip club est partis en flammes. üòî
thank you! Yes I do :)
It was abandoned for a while and it was probably arson :/
ooh what is it?
"lol what can I say I just miss the good old days back when the french knew their place lol"
Tu penses pas que c'est un commentaire? Genre : astheure qu'on a criss√© l'√©difice √† terre, si vous voulez la place, appelez donc la compagnie qui a commandit√© le crime utile pis incidemment c'est une grosse cochonnerie avec des bureau dans le Dix Trente?
Pour le monde qui cherche une nouvelle place o√π attendre 45 minutes pour un burger frette, je recommande fortement le McDo de St-Henri.
Accessible en transport en commun et a c√¥t√© d'un cin√©ma?
C'est quand m√™me un 10 minutes de marche. Si tu veux y aller pour diner et que t'es √† l'est de Five Guys, l'aller-retour te coupe ca pas mal.
Cela dit, Mr Steer c'est un tr√®s bon burger.
Tragique :(
hahaha it's more about the neons for me
Will you shut up man
Gotta be honest, I really love Place des Festivals... without the festivals. It‚Äôs been fun to have it as a normal plaza with the water fountains running all the time, kids playing, people hanging out, no fences or security or big stages with boxes of equipment everywhere.
But I also really miss seeing live music outdoors so I guess I‚Äôll just enjoy this special period while it lasts!
D'apr√®s le titre je m'attendais √† deux mil personnes empil√©es ou une esp√®ce d'√©meute de hockey...
Amazing I miss living at place des arts
*sax plays some jazz notes in the distance*
Qui d'autre a eu une op√©ration lasik aux yeux et qui voit le m√™me genre de rayons √©manant des sources lumineuses la nuit en permanence?
C‚Äôest encore tranquille comme √ßa???
Honestly i should've named this Place Des Arts RTX ON üòÇ
That's great pic of **Place des Festivals**
*Place des Arts* is on the right, behind the *Mus√©e d‚Äôart contemporain (MAC)*.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_des_Arts#/media/File:PlacedesArts_Credit_Caroline_Bergeron.jpg
Belle photo!!!
This cannot be *"right now"* because right now the sun is up and everything is bathed in sunshine. This was clearly taken at night, right around the time that you posted it.
Man I miss living near there. It made my summers magical!
I miss that place
I miss seeing all the smiling faces in this place. It was such a jovial atmosphere when it was happening. It‚Äôs so barren and quite now :(
what a buzz kill...

Shit bro my french sucks üòÇ
I live a block away from the fountains and it‚Äôs pretty busy every day now !
only one reflective light would be on, not enough videocards out there till 2024. great post btw.
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I guess you missed the last part of my message. It's possible to like two different things at the same time. Imagine that.
C'est pas tant le rainbow glare. C'est plus l'effet de rayons "starburst" qui sort de toutes les sources lumineuses et le halo est beaucoup plus gros autour des sources aussi.
√áa va faire bient√¥t un an que j'ai fait faire l'op√©ration.
J'ai √©t√© chez Laservue. Je me souviens plus trop quelle option j'ai pris.
Lol it‚Äôs still this quiet? Even on a Thursday night ?
Oh yeah if you want to improve your French date someone French lol
Dude wtf?!
Wow ca semble comme un effet secondaire serieux.  As-tu parle avec Lasik?  Qu'est-ce q'ils dirent?
Lol i did üòÇ learning french with a learning disability is impossible
Underrated comment. I was told this for years and thought it was a joke. Dated a French person and I definitely improved!
What?
Ouais je leur ai mentionn√© et ils m'ont dit que c'est suppos√© partir. Mais √ßa fait plusieurs mois que √ßa n'a pas chang√©.
C'est rendu tr√®s difficile de conduire la nuit.
J'ai aussi une vision l√©g√®rement double dans l'oeil droit. Juste assez pour que √ßa fasse weird. Mais on m'a dit qu'il fallait attendre un bout.
J'ai pris la garantie √† vie. Alors si y'a quoi que ce soit je peux y retourner pour me faire traiter gratuitement, mais bon. C'est un peu d√©cevant quand m√™me.
I consider my French to suck, but it's unimaginable that you can't read that comment... Like do you never read French news or signs or communicate at all? If so are you here short term? It seems unbelievable.
Ouais, qui veut refaire ca?  Le processus recuperation n'est pas mal, mais c'est annoyant, pis je compris tu ne veut pas refais si tu doit pas.
Born and raised here, i grew up in Parc Ex and was diagnosed with Borderline Intellectual Functioning so no matter how much i want to learn french i legitimately can't
Exactement.
C'est facile comme proc√©dure, mais c'est vachement angoissant. Et la r√©cup√©ration apr√®s aussi c'est stressant. T'as peur de te blesser aux yeux et tout fucker ta vue.
Named after Edward Snowden
Looks like Snowdon to me. Where is this Snowden station?
This is one of my favourite feelings - going down an escalator on an STM station to see the architectural design.
Je me suis souvent demand√© combien p√®sent ces luminaires. Ils sont √âNORMES
They have spy stations down there.
Majestueux!
My station!
Je ne peux pas arr√™ter d'imaginer l'installation de plan√®tes l√†.
Nice shot!
Belle photo!
This is NOT how I remember it at all. I remember all the trash under the stairs at the exit.
Lol thats a way nicer photo than how it actually looks
Wooahh.
Snowdon‚Äôs Deli was a few blocks from this place. Out of the way when I was visiting but totally worth it.
Such a striking photo!
r/liminalspace
Wicked pic
One of my favorite stations in the system !!!!
Slowest escalators ever
Je suis toujours m√©lang√© quand je vais dans cette station de m√©tro.
TIL that the name of the Station and the name of the Whistleblower are spelt differently
Fun fact: the station is actually named after James Snadon ([pictured here (on the left)](https://www.wikitree.com/photo.php/3/3d/Snadon-14.jpg)), who started misspelling his name on purpose to make it sound more English.
It is Snowdon. They just misspelled it.
Except this particular station is so dingy and dirty you notice more the things that need fixing than the architecture. Op is a talented photographer - he managed to make Snowdon look interesting
I just like pizza shapes alot
5 livres minimum

Je me demande depuis des ann√©es s‚Äôils vont changer les deux qui ne marchent plus un jour
Mine too! Fellow Snowdonian!
How's Snowden? Is it a good neighborhood? I'm looking for an appartment and saw some interesting ones on Macdonald Ave
What's good at snowden deli? It's still there i believe

SNO DO NIAN
Snowdonians strong together
It‚Äôs a great neighbourhood. It‚Äôs quiet and noisy at the same time. I used to live on MacDonald. Great area to live in honestly. You‚Äôre not so far away from anything you need. Do you drive?
Decarie pollution galore, cockroaches in every other apartment...
What's not to like?
old fashioned smoked meat, club roll is pretty good. best kreplach soup in town.
I have many favorites. Along with this one, I like Radisson, Honore-Beaugrand, Peel, Lucien L‚ÄôAllier and Bonaventure. Among others.
No one asked me but my fav is Namur! Like Snowdon it has massive light structures.
I think Villa Maria and De La Concorde also look nice.
Good good, yeah it seems like a family little corner, I just heard so much bad stuff about north (or west) of queen Mary haha. I do drive but I won't have a car there, metro won't be a problem, we're students from HEC coming from outside of Montreal
Lol idc abt the pollution but hopefully cockroaches aren't a problem... yikes
Nice! I was at radisson for the first time in forever, and was impressed by the brutalism and the huge spaces. I'll be keeping those in mind while doing my Metro photo hunt!
J'ai quitt√© Montr√©al il y a deux ans et demi. J'avais un 4-1/2 √† $990 direct √† c√¥t√© de M√©tro Place Saint-Henri. Quand j'ai mis mon bail √† transf√©rer en ligne, j'ai eu 50 demandes en moins de 24 heures. J'ai parl√© avec deux personnes et les autres je leur ai dit que c'√©tait d√©j√† pris. C'est ridicule de faire d√©placer autant de gens. Voyons.
√áa m‚Äôa surtout l‚Äôair d‚Äôune tr√®s mauvaise gestion des visites par un propri√©taire. Y‚Äôa actuellement 50-120+++ visiteur pour chaque condo √† vendre sur la rive sud....

Pour 975$, 4 et demi dans Verdun.
Apr√®s 10 demandes de visites s√©rieuses je ne prend plus de visites ou bien j‚Äôenl√®ve les annonces pour √©viter ce genre de situation.
I saw the exact same scene on St-Urbain and Mile End/Plateau in 2000, everyone paying Voir newspaper to get access to the weekly availability list of apartments to rent. If you showed up and weren't 3rd in line, your chances of getting the place were zero. The first three people in line would have bidding wars out in the open.
This scene is shocking if you've never seen something like this but I find it sad that this problem still exists. Look at what speculation had done to Mile End, Plateau, st-henri and you can predict where Verdun is headed. Every neighborhood that made Montreal unique is losing its personality. Good luck to all of you looking for a place, I really do hope things work out for you.
Wonder how much difference in the price between the first visit and the last
I don't understand how rentals are not going down in price. The vacancy rate is at least double what it was last year and possibly even 4 times it was. At what point will some of these landlords drop rents a bit to make the more expensive places affordable?
Moi qui voulait me trouver un truc plus propre et r√©nov√© et l√¢cher mon 4 1/2 dans Villeray √† 820$, je vais peut √™tre prendre mon mal en patience en fait.
even with the terrible prices, it's still a rat race to get a decent place. I found a  large 4 1/2 near place des arts for 1400$, and the number of views and people contacting the people after me were nuts. Like 300 people I think she mentioned.
Triste.
Oh fuck, en est vraiment dans la merde Montr√©al....
Can we pour out a Bull Max for ma ville ?

was nice knowing you   time to head out to smaller towns/repopulate trois rivi√®res

A 4 1/2 for $975 in a great neighborhood is not "affordable" as much as it is "wildly below the market rate." I know rent prices have gone up a lot in the last few years, but damn - sometimes this stuff just seems alarmist to me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Abordable c'est combien?
wow if that gets that crowd for 975$ for a 4/12 , my 5/12 for 940$ in NDG (Villa/Monkland) would probably get half the town
This is what happens when the population of a city grows faster than the number of available places. The only solution is more supply. It‚Äôs frustrating. The city directly controls, or at least strongly influences, the number of places available for rent and purchase through zoning laws.
I wish that next to every Metro, we had a high density condo unit being built, whose units sizes reflect the demand, So like lots of three-bedroom apartments for example.
So many people in the comments are mentioning that the rent is at the same price as a mortgage and I'm so confused by that comment.
Why would someone buy property and then put it up for rent if they were not going to make back their cost in mortgage, taxes and other fees + a profit? It's literally a business and landlords need to be in the positive after all their costs are paid for it to make any sense..
Do you think any local shop would stay in business if they weren't making any profit at the end of the month? Landlords are just another local business!
Support local businesses and pay your rent!
And I get to stay in my shitty olympic village apartment which should be a cooperative. And I can't afford any where else. Fuck this economy in the asshole.
La prochaine fois qu'on vous dit que le r*uissellement de la richesse* existe, pensez √† cette image.
Quand j'ai affich√© mon 4 1/2 √† Verdun √† 775$/mois pour cession de bail v'la trois mois...si j'avais pas refus√© apr√®s 4 visites √ßa aurait donner √ßa aussi.
Congrats Montreal, you have reached [Berlin status](https://metro.co.uk/2018/12/21/hundreds-turn-flat-viewing-affordable-housing-crisis-hits-berlin-8272467/)!
Je viens de quitter un 4 1/2 avec cour dans le village √† 775$ et je crois que c‚Äôest la pire d√©cision que j‚Äôai prise √† vie... J‚Äôen pouvais juste pu d‚Äô√™tre tout seul √† Montr√©al en pand√©mie.
J‚Äôai appris que le proprio l‚Äôa augment√© √† 975$ par mois alors que c‚Äôest moi qui a fait chacune des petites r√©parations. (J‚Äôai rest√© l√† pendant 5 ans sans me faire augmenter)
Montreal going to end up like Toronto people will be living 1hrs 2hrs away from the city the rem and trains will be packed
Wow, that‚Äôs not even to buy, but to rent? Tabarnak!
Je me suis fait donner le fameux avis de reprise pour ce juillet, √ßa m‚Äôangoissait tellement que j‚Äôai commenc√© les visites drette en d√©cembre et j‚Äôai saut√© sur le premier appart qui me plaisait dans mon budget (apr√®s quelques applications rejet√©es). Je suis d√©m√©nag√©e en f√©vrier, crissement stress√©e, mais j‚Äôai √©vit√© la folie du premier juillet 2021 et √ßa je le regrette tellement pas. Quel bon move, moi-m√™me. all landlords are bastards!!!!
Pensse ma rester avec mon 3 1/2 a 655$ pour un autre ann√©e
It‚Äôs all young people who want the urban experience. I don‚Äôt blame them.
Mon 1 et demi a cote de berri UQUAM rendu a 580 prochain avril smh
What a joke.
FYI there‚Äôs a pandemic  so wearing mask is good idea.
Contr√¥le des loyers pi saisie des logements vides par la ville pour fournir au manque de logements sociaux. √áa d√©pla√Æt a qui comme solution au probl√®me?
Landlord will raise the price. Or, they should at least.
Don't bother coming to the plateau then lol. Everything is minimum $1900...
insane!
Shotgun!
On parle de VERDUN...
D'apr√®s moi, une partie du probl√®me vient du manque de logements √† louer. Vers le milieu des ann√©es 90, ils ont commenc√© √† transformer plein d'appartements en condos (oubliez pas que le march√© des condos s'effondrait avant la pand√©mie, et √ßa va continuer de s'effondrer apr√®s), pis 9 fois sur 10, ils construisaient des condos au lieu de nouveaux appartements.  
Donc, trop de condos, pas assez de logements (et trop de caniches)
Ridicule
It's crazy these days.. moved last year and one lady who was renting quite a few places in the West Island said if we wanted to look we needed to come with a cheque for first month's rent in hand, even then it wasn't a guarantee we'd get the place.
define abordable... j'suis curieux.
4 et demi, full tranquille dans mon bloc c'est 800$, avec place de stationnement deneig√©e.
Why is there a shortage of apartments in this city if construction never ends and air bnb is dead in the water?  We should have an over supply if anything.
Also, consider the population of Montreal has been largely flat since 2005.
Venez √† MTL NORD
Hey, y a rien l√† : je vis en banlieue dans une maison, pis mon voisin c'est un des dealers du quartier, des fois y a des line-ups pires que √ßa devant son bungalow le jeudi pis le vendredi soir
That looks like the avenues. 3rd or 4th i think.
When I left verdun I was paying 1150 for a ground floor 6.5 on Lasalle blvd. 
I miss V-town, those were good days.
C'est pour rent ou un achat?
Wtf that's the market price? My mom rents 4 1/2 for not more than 750 in Verdun (the current tenant is late for rent by 3 months or so I've heard but she doesn't know how to kick them out lol).
Gotta hike those rents up! That‚Äôs a steal
975$ for a 4 1/2 in Verdun, Verdun, is good for people? I lived in Verdun, 1987 until 1989 as a child. I hated Verdun. My worst childhood memories were in Verdun. 
Being the only immigrant kid in a school full of quebecois, who‚Äôs parents told all of them that immigrants are baaaad, was such a great experience. So loving and welcoming and accepting. Worst from the teachers too. 
But I digress. Verdun was the ghetto of Montreal. Now people want to pay 975$ for a 4 1/2 there? For Verdun? The ass crack of montreal? 
That‚Äôs just insane. If this does not show you montreal prices are out of whack, nothing will.

Ou des boucles d'oreilles. √áa fait un bail que je m'en cherche √† l'effigie de c√¥nes oranges. J'ai √©cum√© un bon nombre de magasins du centre-ville et du Plateau, sans succ√®s jusqu'√† date.
C'est dans la classification de C√îniferophyta.
Ceci n'est pas un ponto.
Celui a Cote des neiges?
voici la porte
C'est le Frites Alors sur Rachel au coin de Rivard.
Juste de fa√ßon g√©n√©ral. J'habite loin de ceux au centre ville donc, le temps de revenir √† la maison, la poutine est froide.
Alors j'attends la r√©ouverture des salle a manger en 2034
Ah ok, je suis plus de l'Ouest donc jai plus fr√©quent√© les restos dans le coin de l'universit√© mtl
√âdit : c'est pas trop loin de la banquise √áa?
Un truc pour la poutine livr√©e/transport√©e : sauce √† c√¥t√© en contenant, et Si les frites sont froides les mettre au four √† 425 pendant 2-3 mins (ca peut varier) et mettre la sauce par dessus.  Le fromage au four avec les frites d√©pend de comment tu pr√©f√®res ton ti quick, moi je laime frais donc jisolerais les frites
Pour ceux qui ne le savent pas, ¬´¬†Au pied de cochon¬†¬ª est l‚Äôun des restaurants montr√©alais les plus connus (et parmi les plus cher), qui s‚Äôamusent √† payer leur staff le minimum pour des conditions tr√®s exigeant.
edit 1: yes I know front of house staff tips out to the kitchen, but it‚Äôs very small.
edit 2: I also know it isn‚Äôt the *most expensive* culinary destination in Montreal, but it‚Äôs considered expensive for the average quebecois, and it‚Äôs unfortunate that with such a high average cheque that the staff is paid so poorly.
I made the post to highlight that the food service industry, which I grew up in and love so much, unfortunately continues to cling on to a broken business model. The idea is to stimulate discussion, that‚Äôs it.
Je suis tr√®s surpris... Je n'aurais jamais imagin√© ce genre de salaire dans cette cat√©gorie de restaurant! C'est un peu scandaleux...
Just for context... Vices&Versa, un bar √† bi√®res avec un menu assez limit√©, paie ses cuisiniers 18$/h avec un pourcentage des pourboires de service en plus.
[https://www.facebook.com/jobs/job-opening/753329195337771/](https://www.facebook.com/jobs/job-opening/753329195337771/)
Si un bar qui sert des frites et des hamburgers a les moyens de payer 18$/h, c'est honteux qu'un restaurant aussi c√©l√®bre que APDC soit aussi avare.
McDo paye litt√©ralement mieux que √ßa.
WTF?!
C'est pas une p√©nurie de main-d'oeuvre, c'est une p√©nurie de salaire!
C'est riche comme Cresus cte gang l√†. SHAME ON YOU gros poilu.

13$hr was crap when I was a cook 20 years ago. So glad I left that industry. Is feeding a bunch of assholes worth evenings wkds holidays and stress? No thanks I cook at home now ....
Tellement une mauvaise condition de travail l√† en plus. Ils sont cock√© au maximum aussi pour pouvoir runner. Leur cabane √† sucre est pratiquement runner par des esclave qui ont pas de vie car ils les font travailler 18 heures par jour, 6 jours semaines.
I mean McDonald‚Äôs offering $17+h. You have an abundance of choice to work wherever
√áa ressemble √† l'industrie du jeux vid√©o, plus la bo√Æte est connue, moins elle paie cher. Au final disant : "C'est un privil√®ge travailler ici, et les gens font la file ~~fille~~ pour avoir ta place".
A ce prix l√† √ßa m√©riterait de se faire bombarder de faux CV.
I‚Äôve been working in this industry for over 20 years. It doesn‚Äôt pay for experience it pays for the position needed. Don‚Äôt dedicate your time to this industry unless you open your own place, it‚Äôs not worth it.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand why you don‚Äôt put the company above your life! We give you 13.50!!!???‚Äù
Basically them.
Treats you like shit, pays you like shit.
‚ÄúYeah we need 25 000 more immigrants in the country each year because the population doesn‚Äôt buy in our bullshit‚Äù
Nothing against immigrants as I am one. Problem is their solution doesn‚Äôt fix anything rather they prey on desperate immigrants.
Pour la cerise on top, remarquez que le temps plein n'est m√™me pas garantis! Ils ne veulent pas risquer de te donner des b√©nifices.
Labor in the year 2021 is basically indentured servitude if ur not making at least 50,000 a year. Things have gotten so expensive , and companies have not paid the average worker enough money in decades. Companies are greeedy fucks. I dont dream of labour. Employment is death
Eurk. mettons 35h semaine, ca fais 24k par an grosso moddo. On parle de 2000$ par mois dans un coin ou les 1 et demi se loue 1200$ par mois. Pis j'ai meme pas penser aux taxes.
issshhh.
Omg, j'ai vu √ßa ce matin. Carr√©ment insultant. J'me cherche mieux, comme on devrait toujours le faire, mais j'suis plus reconnaissant de faire substantiellement plus comme line cook/grillman. C'est aberrant comme salaire, doublement pour l'√©tablissement.
Et combien le tip des serveur.ses qui veulent probablement pas le partager.
Il n'y a pas de penurie de d'employee, juste une penurie de travail qui paye assez pour vivre. Malheuresement, les petites entreprise qui exploitent les travailleurs ont toujours plus d'influence sur les politiciens que les travailleurs.
Ts√© quand ton salaire te permet m√™me pas de manger l√† o√π tu travailles.
Si les cuisiniers ont leur part des pourboires laiss√©s par les clients: OK, s'pas fou mais √ßa peut devenir int√©ressant pour certaines journ√©es.
Sauf que si tu paies tes employ√©s si peu, je doute que tu sois du genre √† mettre en place des syst√®mes de r√©partition du pourboire...
Ah ben, le gros calice !  
On dirait que pour passer √† TV, faut vraiment √™tre un plein de mardes.
Ce qui fait chier c'est qu'il vont payer vraiment chers pour recruter des employ√©s sous pay√©. Recruter un employ√©, c'est beaucoup de temps et souvent de l'argent aussi. LinkedIn charge 100$ par mois juste pour avoir un compte actif. C'est vraiment n'importe quoi
Edit : mauvais brand de recrutement nomm√©
13,50$ de l'heure ??? Est-ce qu'ils sont malades mental???
This is one of the reasons why I quit the industry. It was all fine and well while living with my parents, but at a certain point I wanted to move out and wouldn't be able to live off 14$/hr.
Aye, went to this place twice with my wife, my check has not once been below $350.
Pay up, ya, tight-fisted fucks!
Qui sont les propri√©taires‚ÄØ?
Je vais arr√™ter d'aller l√†-bas, faisons le boycott d'entreprises qui exploitent les travailleurs.
Literally people have been bombing all their posts on Facebook this morning with this picture as comment. They are getting heavy backlash, this is great.
Et √ßa c'est sans compter l'environnement toxique et l'harcel√®ment psychologique de la part des g√©rants! Vincent est la personne la plus narcissique que j'ai connu de ma vie, il prend un plaisir malsain √† rabaisser quelqu'un devant les autres. Et les neveux Martin roulent sur leur power trip. Et les femmes g√©rantes ne disent rien, enable leurs commentaires sexistes (et parfois racistes) et vont m√™me jusqu'√† rench√©rir parfois. 
Pour ce qui est du salaire est, c'est encore pire √† la cabane √† sucre. Travailler de 9h du matin √† 2-3h du matin (avec un pause de 15 min. avant le service se 17h)... Et recommencer le lendemain √† 9h. J'ai eu la chance de travailler c√¥t√© service, j'aurai pas √©t√© capable de faire √ßa du jeudi au dimanche. Et le salaire des personnes en cuisine est FIXE. Alors elles sont pay√©es ex. 40 par semaine mais travaillent 60. 
Et en ce qui a trait √† la *distribution des pourboires*, personne ne sait combien de pourboires ont √©t√© ramass√©s puisque tout le monde paye √† une caisse unique. Alors l√† gestion ajoute un montant √† ta paye et t'es suppos√© les croire (mais bizarrement les pay√©s ne variaient presque pas...).
√Ä noter que je parle surtout de la Cabane mais j'ai fait quelques shifts au resto sur Duluth et l'environnement est autant toxique.
Je suis pr√©sentement en recherche d‚Äôemploi (pas de ce domaine) et ces juste de plus en plus horrible. √áa fait 4 mois je cherche en plus d‚Äôentrevues merdique qui te ghost. La p√©nurie j‚Äôai pas trop l‚Äôimpression qu‚Äôil y en a vraiment une honn√™tement. J‚Äôai un bac et la plupart des jobs ces 18$-19$ de l‚Äôheure.
Wow 13,50$. J'esp√®re qu'ils paient mieux leurs cochons
You can make more doing delivery. Wtf
ils aiment rire des gens. Incroyable! comment peux t on offrir ce salaire en 2021?
I have a friend who‚Äôs a chef and they‚Äôre always torn between wanting to go to these restaurants to be able to learn and grow as a chef and other less creative places like catering/hotels where the pay is more equitable. They were telling me it‚Äôs hard to bank on tip outs.  
I used to tip in cash, but now I tip by card, I don‚Äôt know if that makes a difference. I like the idea of gratuity included restos but only if the extra dollars actually go towards salary and not profit margin
Je suis cuisinier, et la plupart des restos ouvrent le ball √† 18$ ces temps-ci.
Avec belocum, une application genre d'agence de chercheur de tetes qui envoie des cuisiniers aux restos qui ont besoin d'aide, tu peux aller chercher 25-30$.
Au pied de cochon, c'est honteux en tbnk qu'il paie ses emply√©s aussi bas et j'me cacherai pas d'le dire: c'est pas un bon endroit de travail.
Nice find @OP!
Ciboire... le busboy est pay√© avec les restants de la bouffe??
Damn my restaurant starts at $16 and I thought that was low. This is insulting.
The entire business model of almost all restaurants is based on paying most of their staff at minimum wages.
Either the model needs to change or the minimum wage needs to go up significantly.
I have always been amazed that min. wage doesn't increase annually to keep with inflation.
French requirement? That's brutal.
Ma blonde a travaill√© au H4C Place Saint-Henri longtemps pis ouin, le salaire √©tait pas √©lev√© et les heures BEAUCOUP plus √©lev√©es que 30-40h par semaine. C'√©tait 50, voire 60, voire m√™me 70, sans paye d'overtime.
Fak ouin, je suis pas surpris.
J'aime le fait qu'il y a 5 postes vacances (√ßa doit pas √™tre pour rien) mais non ils vont continuer √† offrir le strict minimum.
J‚Äôai travaill√© en cuisine au PDC un √©t√© √† un salaire similaire, pay√© 40h/semaine pour travailler du 60h/semaine. Dans un environnement effectivement assez toxique. Je n‚Äôy ai plus jamais remis les pieds depuis, fuck MP et son obsession de l‚Äôexploitation humaine et du foie gras.
C'est assez fou de voir le salaire offert dans un restaurant de ce genre..
unrelated mais les restos comme kumamoto ramen dans le centre ville c'est encore pire.
les kitchen staff sont pay√© au salaire de serveur car ils se promenent dans les coulloirs pour enmener la bouffe, mais les tips eux? direct au boss.
donc tu peux etre cuisinier declar√© en dessous du salaire minimum aussi, somehow.
Not only is it restaurants like this, but often you'll see job postings on Indeed that state the following:
Pay 13.50$ - 19.00$ / hour
Tips.
What they tell you when you get to the interview and ask them is that the salary is 13.50$/hour but you'll make 19.00$/hour with tips.
Falsely advertising the wages on indeed has become extremely common for Montreal employers.
La d√©fense du Propri√©taire... par ici: https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1840104/pied-cochon-salaire-minimum-poste-cuisinier-martin-picard?fbclid=IwAR0FXkoOgJNP49gSCz0tQzbd3cOz-oLQXg86OxU6vDpfEauXYIePhlADv30
Pas de sense!  L'employeur ne peut pas payer un cuisinier au salaire minimum, sorry.  A moins que les tips soient tres g√©n√©reux, et la encore.  La pression, connaises requises et les heures variables sont des aspects a consid√©rer et cet employeur va trouver ca difficile de recruter du bon staff a ce salaire.
Pis pendant les mois de janvier et f√©vrier t'es chanceux si tu as 20 heures semaine
Beautiful shot. I've taken a couple of pics from that exact spot. The Mount Royal in the back really makes the shot.

Malgr√© l'AANB de 1867, le statut de Westminster de 1931 et le rapatriement de la constitution en 1982, le Canada reste encore dans un sens sous l'autorit√© de la couronne anglaise surtout avec le poste de gouverneur g√©n√©ral qui repr√©sente la courone anglaise (et par ce fait est chef des forces arm√©es)et peut dissoudre le parlement.
Je suis curieux pourquoi tant de canadiens (principalement hors Qu√©bec) ont encore cet attachement √† la reine.
Je suis d'accord, √ßa serait merveilleux d'√™tre ind√©pendant du Canada
Un peu comme les turques, qui ont envahit le nord de la Syrie, et nos politiciens en parle trop fort ou chiale a propos de ca. Pas trop de reaction diplomatique de notre cote ...
Erdogan is a fucking asshole

It's good that you provided sources, but none of these are actually confirmation from an official source that this is why the lights are white and blue.
It's just that we really like Greece.

pas mal oui. I mean notre gouvernement a des bonnes relations avec l'arabie saoudite, so je suis vraiment pas surpris qu'ils ne disent rien a propos de l'envahissement turque de la Syrie. To be honest, anything that screws over the syrian people, the international community will endorse it
As a Turk I can't agree more! :)
Characters? They're actual real people like you and me.

Je pensais aller me promener aujourd'hui ou demain dans le vieux port pour me changer les id√©es, jai perdu mon meilleur amis hierüò≠
So, Christmas Eve?
J‚Äôaime beaucoup le Vieux Port, mais je suis incapable de voir cette photo sans de terribles souvenirs de l‚Äô√âcole du Barreau...
Tr√®s belle photo! D‚Äôapr√®s moi, elle a √©t√© prise au 2e √©tage du McDo du Vieux-Montr√©al ou d‚Äôun des bureaux au dessus.
Le lever du soleil √©tait simplement magnifique ce matin!
Merci ,ont va voir comment √ßa va aller ü•∫ j'appr√©cie beaucoup

I miss Montreal so much, the snow, the chill, the poutime, the supermarkets lol. I was there during my college time and it was one of the most stress-free times I have had in the past decade.
Is this from where you live? Or did you go out to take this beautiful shot?
Beautiful shot
Gorgeous. Not far from me.
ü•∞
I miss Montreal...RIP snow and orange cones! üòÇ
Thought Montreal would be fully covered in snow, what is this
I‚Äôve walked down this block!
People are living in old port while I‚Äôm trying to survive in the ghetto (:
Brutal. Flat concrete center of frame. If the aesthetic comes from the art deco building, why not focus in on 'er bud? If you are taking a photo of the horizon sunrise, why not take a horizontal shot?
Mes condol√©ances üíî
Oh no! I'm so sorry. Please stay strong.
Yep, coin St-Laurent / Notre Drame Ouest.
Pas mal s√ªr que cette photo a √©t√© prise depuis le McDo lol
On a quand m√™me eu quelques No√´l non blanc dans les derni√®res ann√©es
This is the mcdonalds hahaha
There is no art deco building in this shot.
Merci
Thank you
M√©chante belle vue pour un McDo!
Did I just get a taste of the rumored stories about how if you speak English in Montreal quite a lot of people will speak French back to you
Il me semble qu'il est fermer pour la saison hivernale?
Oh merde

People on this sub reply in both languages.

You must be New here. People post on french and get comments in english or post in english and people respond on french.
De plus, tu sais clairement que Montr√©al est une ville francophone!
Une fois j'ai r√©pondu en anglais √† quelqu'un qui parlait fran√ßais et il a sugg√©r√© que c'√©tait une sorte d'oppression haha

Wondering that as well.
Ho! My God!!! How could you nail it so accurately! I almost miss that smell!
Oh that fresh smell of worms!

The reverse problem of Google maps pronouncing every street name like some tourist who's never heard of the existence of French drives me up the wall too.
Just pay an intern to tag those streets with "fr" or something, jeez.

Put your phone in French it makes it way easier. Plus it gives you little opportunities to practice if you're still learning.
Jean-talon always makes me laugh. I have to say is like you would if you knew zero French whatsoever
I took the Vaudreuil train into town the other day. The nice exo lady on the PA system announced that the next train for "Looshyen Lallyer" would be arriving on platform 2 instead of platform 1. I shit you not.
Better luck next time, madame.

don‚Äôt live in those areas and don‚Äôt need a pizza, just wanted to say that you and your girlfriend are amazing people! MTL is lucky to have you two!
Don‚Äôt need anything but if you guys are able to gain traction on this I will match an additional 5 pizzas for people who would need it.
You're doing a great thing. If for some reason you can't figure out a French message, ping me and I'll translate.
You and your partner are amazing human beings. Thank you for lighting up someone‚Äôs darkness with your kindness.
Love it!  
Ill extend the offer to the South-West (Verdun, Lasalle,  Lachine, Griffintown)  
Pick a place, pick a pizza, message me.
First 5 get a pizza
<3 Tifosi, thanks for doing this, it warms my cold heart :)
This is the Montreal I like to see! Luckily I‚Äôm not in desperate need either. Thank you strangers !
Maybe a womans shelter? I\`m sure they could use the good cheer. or a homeless shelter.   
I like this idea, kudos to you for having a ginormous heart.. we need more of those xo
Simply awesome people..
That‚Äôs great! If I was in the financial capability of doing something like this, I would jump on the opportunity! Nothing but the best for you guys!
Je ne vis pas dans ces coins et je n‚Äôai pas besoin d‚Äôune pizza. Je voulais juste dire que vous et votre partenaire √™tes des gens extraordinaires. Montr√©al a la chance de vous avoir parmi nous!
I'm okay, but thank you for doing this. Much love.
Thank you for doing this! I sent you a PM.
**Big thank you** to u/blackBomber, his GF and anyone else who contributed.
Just received my pizza and it was delicious! 
REALLY REALLY REALLY appreciate this!
Thank you, this is very kind and considered from both of you
Great initiative! 
If ever you don't get enough request, may I suggest sending some to a CHSLD for the workers there?
That‚Äôs an awesome gesture bro
Still some good people in the world üåé
Belle initiative. Le monde a besoin de plus de gens comme vous. Tout le monde devrait pouvoir manger une pizza le vendredi!
I live in HoMa and just wanted to say that you are absolutely top shelf human beings, and people like you make me hope that karma (real life karma not the worthless reddit kind) is real <3 
Keep being amazing
Bravo!

U is a dope dude blackBomber
Amazing!!! Love this. You rock OP!!!!! üôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôåüèΩ
so did you get your 5 requests?  good on you for doing this, very nice of you.
Very cool of you, OP!
For anyone else who wants to do this on a larger scale or anyone else who might need a pizza, there's /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza
This is the spirit of the season right here ‚ù§Ô∏è Bravo, vous-√™tes de si petits anges! We're not food scarce here, but you're gesture is admirable and inspiring.
Bless you both - lovely gesture
You guys are amazing!
Just the gesture brought a smile to my face, good people.
this redditor is a true g
This is awesome man, I've been trying to think of nice things to do as well, I was planning on making a ton of soup but I need to find somewhere to bring it.
This is a fun idea
Edit: Screw it I'm in PM me I'm in for a few pizzas amigo
You guys are so nice! I would sure eat a pizza but ill pass, cause someone else need it more than i do.
If there any left im in montreal and could use the help
Just want comment to say what a nice gesture! I say we should do a random pizza exchange. We only ask for allergy but then we send to each other pizzas without telling them what resto/chain or what flavour we chose. Could be fun!
C‚Äôest tellement gentil √† vous de faire √ßa! kudos to you!
I was reading your post and it reminded me of this woman in Brooklyn who gave up her posh day job to bake pizzas at home and give them to the needy. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E0ilkXyamk&t=171s
I've seen lots of videos on vice about people selling food from home and it seems that it was mostly all short lived. I wonder how long you could keep it going before the authorities shut you down. I'm an avid pizza maker myself and the only extra investment (that I can provide for myself) i would need would be some big proofing trays/extra tupperwear and maybe a steel so I can keep the conduction cooking temperature somewhat constant in between taking in/out pies from the oven.
This is really kind and thoughtful!
You're a good man.
Sidebar: I had the Tifosi in Rosemont and I thought it was quite bad. Is the one in the Plateau any different?
Love this!
This is awesome
Tifosi is dope! Bon choix!
Damn, I‚Äôm hungry, at the same time never been richer(not really), thanks covid for taking away from me everything I love to throw money at! If i can recommenc you something, pizza is great but was is better is dry food for food bank ino, this way you‚Äôll know you reach people in distress! Thanks!
i love pizza and I have been very sad all day. Pizza please pizzzzzza
*Virtue Signaling: *The Reddit Post
Since nobody wants the pizza , can I have one ? :))
Dont buy from Fugazzi , it‚Äôs overpriced
What a kind offer. I think we might be able to take you up on it. I'll PM you with information for the next 5 and we'll coordinate. Thanks so much for being a very cool random guy.

Une aurore Montr√©al.
Pris Mercredi dernier du c√¥t√© du pont de l'√Æle aux tourtes. Ce n'√©tait pas les lumi√®res de la tour Desjardins pour une fois !
C'est subtil. √âtait-ce plus visible en personne?
At this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the country, localized entirely within your kitchen?
I just pretend that the green lights beaming into the clouds from DT are the auroras.
Whaat. Moi aussi je veux en voir une! Je dois aller me poster ou pour ca?
woowwwww! c'est tres rare!
[deleted]
Wow. Was it by chance or did you plan it? And if so, how?
It's very subtle because most of the aurora got stuck in traffic coming into Montreal.
J'en ai d√©j√† vu une superbe sur la 15 √† la hauteur de Blainville, c'√©tait un dimanche soir en hiver. 
La 2e plus belle chose que j'ai vu dans ma vie, j'ai du arr√™ter sur le bord de l'autoroute tellement la beaut√© m'avait rentr√© dedans.
Wow, do you think there'll be more activity soon? Was it visible by the naked eye?
There have been quite a few reports of solar flares lately, wonder if that's why we'd see these so far south from the poles :O
/EDIT: Seems like it! https://www.cp24.com/news/northern-lights-may-be-visible-in-much-of-the-country-this-weekend-after-solar-storm-1.5645463
Il va en avoir de plus en plus :). A va etre magiquement beau
ah oui, la belle aurore desjardins
ho wow c'etait quand ?
T'es chanceux. j'ai toujours voulu le voir.
I hope this isnt bad news
Nah c'est Desjardins
Aliens
Je t'aime, mais je t'ha√Øs.
Pour ceux qui ne connaitraient pas, le recueil de nouvelles ¬´¬†Les aurores montr√©ales¬†¬ª de Monique Proulx est excellent.
h√© jvoullait le faire
Hahahaha what I was thinking about when I first saw the pic.
Est-ce depuis Montr√©al vers l'ouest ou depuis Vaudreuil ou m√™me depuis l'√Æle Perrot? Je ne reconnais pas l'angle.... (Et j'habite la r√©gion, peux pas croire la chance que tu as eu!!)
As-tu un lien sur Google Maps de l'endroit exact o√π tu as pu observ√© l'aurore?  Je suis tellement jaloux!
En effet, tr√®s subtil ! Je voyais juste le flare √† droite √† l'≈ìil nu, le reste est apparu via la photo prise de mon t√©l√©phone
yes
My version of the aurores bor√©ales are the lights coming from the complexe desjardins üíÄüíÄ
En dehors de Montr√©al de pr√©f√©rence!  Le plus au Nord possible et le plus loin de sources de pollution lumineuse.
J'ai eu la chance d'en voir une assez spectaculaire couch√© dans la neige et la glace call√©e du r√©servoir Taureau √† St-Michel-des-Saints.  √áa remplissait le 3/4 du ciel. Je te souhaite d'en voir une.
Yeah but you saw a turkey in Verdun
Can't get em all
I got an alert through the Aurora app. It was saying there is 8% chance of seeing them where I am in Montreal. That was the first time I got this percentage since I downloaded the app 5 years ago. Usually it's around 1-2%. 
Then I look for some live pics on Facebook and I saw the whole Qu√©bec was getting the Auroras (Gatineau, Quebec, Gasp√© etc). So I started to search for an area where to look north without too much light pollution. I didn't know much what to expect. I arrived there after driving 30mn and the Auroras show was finished. So I waited for one hour and it happened again and this is when I took the pic. It lasted a few minutes..
Pas op, mais je sais qu'il existe des sites qui surveillent l'activit√© solaire et qui pr√©disent √† quelle latitude les aurores bor√©ales sont visibles. En surveillant ce genre de site tu peux pr√©voir quand sortir ... ou perdre patience parce que c'est vraiment rare si loin au sud.
Also wondering this
The right flare was visible to the naked eye. You have to download app about aurora and they will send you notifications. Waited for 5 years to get that notification btw lol
This! ‚òùüèº Hopefully, we won‚Äôt get our satellites fried.
Pourquoi?
?
Merci, de rien!
Y'aurait fallu te lever plus t√¥t.
May I see?
Et il faut aussi √™tre chanceux en ti p√©p√®re! √Ä cette latitude c'est rare qu'il y ait des aurores visibles, et m√™me en allant plus au nord il y a jamais de certitude. [Regarde ici comme exemple](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/aurora-30-minute-forecast); m√™me dans le cercle polaire la probabilit√© est qqchose comme 20-40%.
[deleted]
Wow so cool! I respect your commitment. 
What is the name of the app you mentioned?
Le soleil a deja commenc√© a degager plus de tempete magnetique. C‚Äôest tempete creer les aurore lorsque il se frappe contre le bouclier magnetique de la planete.
I mean it like an omen
...no
you have the great turkey flair of '19 so you must have been involved
"My aurora forecast and alerts"
Lovely. I really need to get up early in the morning again. Feels like my days are too short otherwise.
I love the colors, great picture !
I love it. This photo makes me sad that I moved out of town.
I think doing the whole ''watching the sunrise on Mont Royal'' after a really good night out with friends is a rite of passage for Montrealers lol. Absolutely love doing it, such good memories associated with this picture!
Cue Lion King music
Wow! Love love love montreal
Do there s any free or roadside parking?
Just look at the wether and go to the Belvedere during sunrise, the sunlight and colors are gorgeous ‚ô•Ô∏è
Look for lac aux castors in mont-royal on google map, there is a parking nearby but you will need to do the rest on foot like 30-20min on foot
[deleted]
Asking cause there are no stupid questions, how is the walk from up there at night? Are there lights or is it still quite dark?
40
from the walked from lac au castor, there was no light whatsoever, i tried to use my phone's flashlight but i could only see 4 feet away , also the bushes were moving a lot (probably racoon and foxes)
Sorry I was tired. It says mont royal ok
Je travaille comme col bleu √† Montr√©al et je vous jure depuis que j'ai travaill√© dans les parcs j'ai perdu espoir en l'humanit√©. L'√©t√© pass√©, le lendemain de la f√™te du Canada, moi et mon coll√®gue, √† nous deux seulement avions remplis 90 sacs de poubelle en un avant midi. Et √ßa c'est seulement les d√©chets qui tra√Ænait dans le parc et non dans les poubelles du parc. L'√©t√© en g√©n√©ral au parc lafontaine c'est tout simplement d√©gueulasse. Les gens ont aucun respect.
Tellement d√©gueulasse. Inacceptable.
Since Covid it's even worse. I live next to Angrignon Park and it's littered with trash every weekend. More people are spending so much more time in the parks, but there doesn't seem to be more garbage cans or collection. And of course, people have no respect.
Fuck these ppl . Leave no Trace how hard is that
People saying we need more public garbage cans have never considered how things are done in other countries, like Japan. 
We need better people.
People fucking suck
Imagine si on n'avait pas de consigne sur les bouteilles canettes... √áa serait encore pire.
Ce qu'on voit dans les parcs... j'ai deja vu un monsieur baisser les culottes de son enfant au parc Jarry et le tenir dans les air pour qu'il fasse caca a cot√© (mais pas dans) une poubelle.
C'est un m√©lange de culture Qu√©b√©coise ou on s'attend a ce que le gouvernement nous ramasse et de d'autres cultures ou ils s'attendent a ce que personne ramasse.
I noticed most people doing this are really young people.. like 16-20 year olds. Last year there was like 5-6 guys eating their chicken sandwich next to the Coco Rico and one threw the bag and wrapper to the ground. I picked it up and told him off. I really tried not to say anything but It really just pissed me off. No shame. Streets were packed and he didn't care.
I think it's clear we need more garbage/recycling cans in our parks. This has been an issue for years, but covid has exasperated this greatly since its basically one of the few places people can get together.
Honestly disgusting.
Avec le beau temps qui reviens, le gouvernement a presque plus d'excuses pour au moins rouvrir les terrasses. Ce weekend c'√©tait plein de gens de foyers diff√©rents qui soupaient/d√Ænaient/buvaient dans les parcs.
Montreal has become a huge open-air littering trash can over the years, first the cigarettes butts every where, and now masks and whatnot.
Edit: thanks for the downvote, I know the truth hurts, but yeah, maybe you should pick up your own trash so you don't hear these kind of comments.
This reminds me when last summer people went to Gasp√©sie and destroyed the beaches with trash and shit (litteraly shit, as in they shat on the beach). Locals just  put them all under the "514 people" category, and anywhere I went last aummer people made comments in the "You better clean after yourself" type.
Just makes me desperate to see that some poeple even don't care about trashing their own city.
If you litter you should have to do a day of community service picking up trash.
Every time you get caught doing it you get 1+2x days of community service, x being the number of times you've been caught.
I was excited and then caught on to the sarcasm.
I come from a small town and I had to defend the city a lot back when I moved, because people from home thought that because it's a big city people don't have a sense of community, which I feel is very untrue because we associate with our neighbors, and have borough pride and are generally very community-oriented. 
Seeing stuff like this makes me so so sad, because I had and still have to have Montr√©al's back when it comes to solidarity and I guess I like to imagine that we're better than this.
Look at it positively...the seagulls are no longer confined to KFC parking lots and can now hang out in nature!
These people are pigs.
its quite the shit show
Rien n‚Äôexcuse ce comportement absolument sauvage, par contre j‚Äôhabite au coin du Parc Jeanne-Mance et je crois qu‚Äôil y a au grand maximum 5 poubelles dans toute l‚Äôimmensit√© de ce parc. C‚Äôest compl√®tement ridicule!
I bet the people who did that are sharing pro-environment stuff on their instagram.
Jesus. IMO it belongs to the other citizens to educate them where their parents failed. See someone throwing trash or not cleaning mess? Give them trouble! I did that twice already to people not picking up their dog shite, and just by seeing their face full of shame and discomfort, I can tell you it works! If they're still assholes even at this point , start following them.
Don't ever live in LA. This is the only version of parks that exists there.
Source: from LA
Covid isnt the problem nor is it needed more trash bins. It's the people. It takes 30 seconds to put all that garbage in the pabst carton and walk it over to a garbage can. Just think about others and not that someone else will do it
Edit: I literally see a garbage can in the background to the left!
Une vrai honte.
Compare Montr√©al et Toronto, la diff√©rence est choquante.
1. We need a public campaign in order to change the culture. Many of us would love a cleaner city and our taxes should pay for it. 
2. We need way more garbage cans, including those special closed ones that break down waste such as dog shit. 
3. The pubic campaign should include fine givers for a period of time until the behaviour changes. 
4. We need public washrooms in parks with attendants as in Paris. Interesting, Outremont‚Äôs parks have washrooms and student attendants in the summer. You rarely see much garbage there on a Sunday afternoon despite all the picnickers.
5. The public needs to call people out if they can safely do so. Same goes for people who leave dog shit around.
6. In some countries, they hire neighbourhood (local) people to clean up the alleys etc. Some neighborhood groups now do this voluntarily. 
Believe it or not, I can remember times when the garbage situation was way worse in Montreal. It has been embarrassing to take my European relatives, who live in pristine cities, around Montreal at some points back in time. 
While we are at it, another kind of garbage is the pollution from cars. Why do I never see people get tickets for idling their motors while they pop in for tale-out, or whatever?
thanks for the positive spin, I love it!
the chicken bones is a dog waiting to die!
trash is reason #439 why I moved out of Montreal!
Personally I like How every trashcan is in a constant state of overflow just as a reminder that that is where trash should go
The worst part is you can see garbage cans in the picture. Absolutely lazy and disgusting.
My hypothesis is that the covid situation is contributing heavily to general nihilistic and anti-social behavior. 
Don't take this as a removal of culpability or a statement of cause. It's definitely a plausible contributing factor.
this picture kinda made me laugh bcuz its savage and the people had a big night of drinking and eating fried chicken while being huge fucktards. i bet it was cartman
Why is Toronto clean and Montreal isn't?
Lets not forget about kids, this is mostly kids.
Even if theyre 40 yrs old living in the plateau.
√Ä l'√©poque o√π nos lointains anc√™tres √©taient des singes arboricoles, les restes de nourriture, la pisse et la merde tombaient naturellement sous l'arbre. Quand √ßa sentait trop, qu'il y avait trop de mouches, on changeait d'arbre. 
C'est pas tout le monde qui √©tait pr√™t √† descendre de l'arbre.
This is why there is a fence around Verdun Beach :(
A decade ago I went to Innsbruck and was shocked how quiet the bars were. My friends and I went by a park and saw ppl were gathering for drinks, smoking etc. Thought wow this would be so cool in montreal. Then I came to the realization this works in Innsbruck because at the end of the night everyone works together to clean up their mess and leave the park like it was the day before. It‚Äôs unfortunate people suck so hard here when it comes to picking up after themselves and the idea of ‚Äúsomeone gets paid to do this‚Äù mentality
Of all the fines I would personally be okay with the police giving out, it would be fines for those who litter. People who don't pick up after themselves need to grow the fuck up
Degueulasse!
That‚Äôs awful. 
Meanwhile, here I am chasing a wrapper down sidewalks, through street traffic, or all other obstacles‚Äîeyeing that piece of trash like it was a million dollar lottery ticket‚Äîif it just so happens to blow out of my stroller‚Äôs cup holder. 
And then there‚Äôs these people... geez.
So sad people don't know how to pick up after themselves..specially if it is as basic as this!
Disgusting pigs. Pick up your shit!
Very disappointed there's no actual cool, revolutionary, bleeding-edge waste system to hold over Toronto's head.
What kind of world class scum does this?
We're fortunate enough that we can drink wine and beer in parks and these assholes are going to ruin it.
To be fair, they probably couldn't walk or see straight after having that much to drink, so asking them to clean up after themselves would be asking a bit much. (/s)
Wow, j'savais meme pas qu'on pouvait laisser ca aux tables! Je vais commencer a le faire plus souvent, merci!!
As a past automatic trash collector at Jeanne Mance parc I did my best. People don't realize how much work goes into trying to make the area welcoming. Also if you bring bottles of beer or wine into the children section you are an ass. I used to spend so much time every morning cleaning shattered glass from the sand pits before the kids arrive
Scum.
Hen? Ou √ßa les syst√®mes automatis√©s de ramassage?? C'est nouveau? C'est vraiment cool, on va pouvoir aller dans les parcs pis vivre comme des h\*stites de cochons red necks sans se sentir coupables!!!
Lol ‚Äústewards of the land‚Äù.
Ouin j'√©tais un de ces con quand j'avais 18 ans... d√©sol√©. C'√©tais 'cool' √™tre un peu d√©linquent I guess... Ts√© t√© saoul, tu trash la place, tu joue √† casse toute, t'es con quoi...
Heureusement pour moi et mes potes √ßa n'a pas dur√©e trop longtemps cette phase pis √ßa fait un boute que c'est vraiment plus cool de respecter la place.
Smoke from forest fires?
Smoke from wildfires in Ontario is obscuring the sun (and moon), as well as contributing to today's smog warning.
Our sun is collapsing into a red dwarf. It‚Äôs the end for us
Je pensais que j'√©tais high lol. C'√©tait magnifique.
The moon is red as well tonight.
Prick your fingers. It is done.
The moon has now eclipsed the sun. 
The angel has spread its wings.
The time has come for bitter things.
A red sun rises. Blood has been spilled this night.
Info crime j'ai trouv√© votre lune...

Juste des nuages sans fin.
Yes it was a beaut. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Yup my mom was super amazed by it she kept getting me to come out and see. We took pictures. The moon was also nice tonight.
When I was a kid I remember a summer QC had a lot of big wildfires, and there were a few days when the sky was hazy and orange, it reminded me of that
Black hole sun, won't you come
It seems we both saw it from the same place lol
Yup. I'm kicking myself over it. I happen to have a tripod and phone mount in the trunk of my car for just such occasions, but I hadn't charged my phone overnight and it shut off right as I was about to snap a photo.
Does that mean we're all going to die?
Habs Sun
The moon was the same last night. It was eerie.
No, but yesterday the moon was orange. Wish I took a picture.
The moon a couple of days ago was also deep red (crescent over the horizon)
The blood moon rises once again
I did too and I‚Äôm in the DC area WAY south, but it looked exactly like this

I thought that Madara Uchiha was here xD
C'est l'≈ìil de Jeff Petry ?
Yes I did, Mississuga, Ont
I remember seeing that once, when smoke from forest fires in James Bay drifted down here...it smelled like a barbecue and the sun looked like Mars.
And the moon last night!
Ontario fires, I think
Ayt, jme fais comme trois bowl daffiler dans un parc, je sort dans rue en ecoutant du apocalyptic country, pi jai la lune de sang (profecie chretienne de lapocalypse) qui me sort dans face, bad trip ma race.
The moon was also red/orange
C√¢lice, mon chum pis moi on s'est arr√™t√©s comme des caves sur Saint-Denis pour la fixer un peu plus longtemps que nos r√©tines ne l'auraient voulu en se disant que c'√©tait la strawberry moon.
&#x200B;
En plus, un quick search me r√©v√®le que ladite strawberry moon, elle √©tait belle en hostie cette ann√©e, et pis que je l'ai manqu√©e.
What camera did you use?
I'd know that view anywhere! How're old Berthe and Rene?

Yeah, it means blood has been spilt. Some dud taught me that
Smoke from forest fires.
https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/mobile/smog-warnings-issued-in-southern-quebec-due-to-ontario-forest-fires-1.5515475
You are right.
It's not from fire in Ontario, it's from the California wild fires
It's better to burn out than to fade away
It would actually need to expand in a red giant first. Not the same sequence.
Our sun will end up a white dwarf.
Nahhh, we got like 10 minutes before the shit hits us.
Ah best comment so far
Good.
C'est  beau la fin du monde, hein?
Oh! Didn't notice it. Also, it was usually foggy today.

Choc post traumatique
YES, I LOVE IT! I want to open a store similar to the ampelm√§nnchen store in berlin, but instead of the little guy in the pedestrian signals, its a store with different object in the shape of orange cones
Please tell my you have a hat!
Whoever wears that, can I ask you to stand somewhere for a while?
Ponto would wear that for sure!
Bonus: √ßa peut aussi servir de costume de "sashimi de saumon le plus fucking fat de l'atlantique"  :D
C'est vraiment bien r√©ussi.
Took me a second... but what you did there...I see it.
Lmfao nice one :p
whoever wears this and gets his ass ran over is for sure not getting a dime from the insurance. :P
Belle id√©e, mais √ßa ressemble plus √† du saumon vue de tr√®s pr√®s.
I didn't realize this was r/montreal so I was zooming in to see if there was a city skyline or something to figure out this "landmark" ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
A lot of people are correctly pointing out that it looks like salmon sashimi. Any advice on making it look more like the cones?
Si Montr√©al avait une √©quipe sportive, ce design devrait √™tre celui de leur uniforme.

I love it! How did you tie it for the pattern? I'd like to make one too.
Great for saving a parking spot for a friend, just wear and stand.
Camouflage
Bravo!
‚ÄúFerb, I know what we‚Äôre gonna do today‚Äù
Phineas and ferb
Remind me of those construction cones. Tbh it‚Äôs awesome though don‚Äôt take me wrong.
If I had an award to give‚Ä¶
LOVING it. Bravo!
Haha, this made no sense at all until I looked at the sub. Then it made all the sense.
I think it‚Äôd be cute with a graphic of the very hungry caterpillar on it or of vultures sitting on the white perched on the orange  lines for a creepy look 
Or maybe a wild goose chase happening up and down the shirt
It's perfect lmao
the orange line?
What are you using as a fixer?  Every time I try tie die, the colours all wash out practically immediately.
it took me awhile to figure out which landmark. lol
I died laughing omg good one
Love the leopard blanket too lol
Love the joke but for real could I buy that shirt, I‚Äôm dressing up as phineas and ferb for halloween and I really need that shirt
I saw the title before I saw the subreddit and was trying to figure out what city it was....
Next, make a pothole.
Awesome! Now we just need a solid orange shirt with "D√âTOUR ‚û°Ô∏è"  in huge black letters to complete
the set.
Haha that‚Äôs genius!
honestly...if you hang onto this until next years "wear orange day" you can sell it for a huge profit.   
source: am mother who scoured the city looking for an orange shirt and ended up tie-dying a white one.  i know FOR SURE i was not the only one.
I-Cone-ic indeed
I saw a car parked in Mile End with an air freshener in the shape of a traffic barricade. I wanted *so bad* for the driver to emerge so they could tell me where they got it.
Two years agi, the No√´l √âternel store downtown had little Christmas tree orange cones with Montreal on them. Unfortunately they sold out before I could get one.
For those wondering its a cute webcomic about an anthropomorphic orange cone. https://minyaka.com/ponto/
Ponto for Mayor! We have more cones than humans anyhow, right?
Right?
Merci bien
On n'est pas les seules.
Add the Ponto face.
the stripes need to be horizontal and maybe a bit wider? I mean if you pair it with orange pants and a construction/d√©tour sign tacked on somewhere now, people will get the message :p
Montr√©al a 3 √©quipes sportives professionnelles, de quoi tu parles?
I could explain it but I'm a visual learner so [this](https://youtu.be/Kit4FnCF4FU) is the video reference I used to make the shirt.
i live there since 2017 (close to the march√© maisonneuve) and really we love this neighborhood as a place to grow a family. the people are nice and lots of other families in the parcs every day. Yes we have our share of problems but i think like you said, it's underrated... however the price here is jacking real time and it'll soon be as expensive as rosemont or verdun.
J'habite dans Hochelaga depuis je suis arriv√© au Canada. Il y a  toujours eu une connotation n√©gative sur ce quartier qui est comprenable puisque j'ai vu des affaires weird asf. Des prostitu√©s qui me disaient qu'elle me chargeait pas cher parce que j'√©tais un jolie petit gar√ßon, des vieux msieur qui se parle tout seul ,crie, se battent, du monde qui fournique dans les buissons. Maintenant, il y a encore ces sp√©cimens qui lag un peu partout mais on voit les gens qui y d√©m√©nage am√®ne une belle ambiance , par contre, y'am√®ne aussi les hausses de prix loool
Wait until its nighttime
I've been is this neighborhood for almost 20 years now and I agree 100%
When I first moved to Montreal in 2001 I had an apartment by station Radisson and one of the first movies my friend made me watch was Hochelaga and I remember telling myself that I would never live there.  Year later I found an apartment corner Prefontaine and Ontario, fell in love with a co worker who's lived in Hochelaga her whole life at the local Radio Shack on Ontario where I worked, bought a duplex and accepted that it will be the place I will grow old. This was a proud middle class industrial neighborhood way before its downturn in the 70s and its a pleasure to see it flourish once again.
It has so much history, a huge attitude, and it just a great example of a french Montreal neighborhood, the kind of place I dreamed of living as a franco Ontarien raised byt french media from quebec and montreal, I will die here, it is my home.  
Also I don't believe it's under rated.
La rue Morgan est √† mon avis l‚Äôune des plus belles rues de Montr√©al.
J'y suis depuis 2015, j'y avais habit√© avant, pendant 5 ans d√©but 2000. J'ai toujours ador√© le quartier, avec ses "ups" et ses "downs". Les b√¢timents sont magnifiques, surtout dans le vieux maisonneuve, avec le march√©, les bains, les vieux b√¢timents de pierre sur adam... C'est sans pr√©tention, le monde "fendant" vont vivre ailleur ;) Y'a du monde pok√©, vrai, j'imagine que √ßa nous laisse plus sensible au sort des moins chanceux que nous et plus humain. Les activit√©s trash cool de la promenade Ontario, les punks qui jouent du bluegrass au parc lalancette, ceux qui pratique leur cirque au parc hochelaga, les modules de jeux et les ruelles remplis de kids, les soir√©es food truck au stade, le biodome, le jardin botanique, tout √ßa √† distance de marche de chez nous.
Hochelaga √©tait le quartier ouvrier des canadiens fran√ßais. Les loyers √©tait abordables. Ce qui √† beaucoup nuis √† sa r√©putation c'√©tait la pr√©sences en grand nombres de diff√©rents club motards. Surtout leurs guerres des ann√©es 90 et d√©but 2000. 
Comme toutes les autres quartiers de Montr√©al les bobos l'ont gentrifi√©s. Sauf que dans Hochelaga ils sont surpris et inquiets qu'il y ait une piquerie au coin de la rue. Pis les junkies sont tout autant √©tonn√©s de voir qu'un bistro qui vend des caf√©s latt√© √† 7$, l'autres bords de la rue.
Don't know if I would say it's underrated, feels like a majority of of the French speaking Montrealers that I know have chosen Hochelaga (or Rosemont Est) as their hood. They moved there while they were studying because the rent was super low and all the services are there. And also because they liked the vibe.
But it also really varies a lot depending where you are in the neighborhood. My brother lived on Adam close to Davidson so one corner away from St. Catherine East and you cross a lot of... Let's say strange people. Eventually his place was robbed and that convinced him to move away.
Probably underrated architecturally speaking, otherwise, not so sure!
+ great pics!!

Did the 650,000$ condos with 600$/month fees give you a hint?
Greedy real estate brokers and developers won't stop until most of us can't afford to live anywhere.
I dont know man. I've been walking around Montreal all summer. We're doing the inventory of all the ash trees on the Island. I've walk all over Hochelaga, in people's backyard, in alleys etc. Hochelaga is by far the worst place I've been and I'm glad I don't have to go there anymore. 
It smells of garage everywhere you go no matter what day it is, theres trash everywhere. Alley are in bad conditions, its either a jungle or a dump. 
I've never seen a pregnant woman smoke cigarette before I went to Hochelaga. I wish I could tell you that I saw only one but you know...
Oh yeah...I saw I fucking kitten fell from the 4th floor of an appartment and hit the pavement so fucking hard... Only in Hochelag
It's not cheap because iT's A weLl KePt sEcreT.
OP did you shoot with a film or is it just the edit ?  If film, what did you use ?
Das my hood
That picture could literally be any Montreal neighborhood.
Mon premier apartment a Montr√©al, quand j'√©tait √©tudiant, √©tait a Hochelaga, a 2 coin de rue du Stade. La journ√©e ou je  d√©m√©nage, l'immeuble voisin √©tait entour√© d'un cordon de police, il venait d'y avoir un meutre. Le lendemain, j'ai du rattraper un sans-abris a la course, il venait de voler mon v√©lo, heureusement il √©tait trop stone pour aller bien vite ou se battre trop fort. Et le jour des poubelles en √©t√©... c'√©tait avant les bacs. Tu pouvais pas ouvrir les fenetres.
Pour un gars de r√©gion, c'√©tait plutot brutal comme arriv√©e en ville.
We just moved here and love it... aside from not being able to find daycare! But the area, people, and scenery is lovely.
Our city is so damn beautiful.
Je viens d‚Äôacheter sur  Desjardins x Adam et avant d‚Äôam√©nager , j‚Äôavais beaucoup d‚Äôaprioris . Il s‚Äôav√®re que le quartier est tr√®s agr√©able √† vivre . Content de mon choix . Nice shots btw
My old stomping grounds! I used to live close by prefontaine Station back in 2012... so many memories and I miss everything about it! Now I'm back visiting mtl this week and i am making plans to walk around the area again :)
Moved to HOMA in the beginning of 2020 from westmount and love it... there's certainly an element of sketch in some areas (the shlag is huge,) but it's a great community, and probably one of the last bastions of pre-gentrification MTL, although it's creeping in here, too.
it is really great!
what saddens me is the project for REM aerien which will put a scar in the neigborhood with so much potential for beauty
what are the locations on these pics? planning to make a trip at montreal soon!
It‚Äôs a charming neighborhood, some of the local fauna notwithstanding
I‚Äôve been in that abandoned church, it‚Äôs wild in there, such a shame that it‚Äôs being left to decay.
Nice shots Domenico!
What about all the other places
Been living here for two years and I love it! It has its own experiences.
Then there‚Äôs those snowy days in February with -20 degrees and trying to get to your second floor unit with your shopping bags‚Ä¶give me NDG with indoor staircases, thanks!
Literally nothing in Montreal is Under-rated, except how bad the traffic is and how rude the people are.
Breaking news: local anglo finds out the city goes beyond Saint-Laurent.
Its a really good proximity to downtown and has access to the green line. Kind of surprised the prices weren't already expensive.
That's quite a coincidence since I go to Sophie Barat actually
Hey oh, on veut garder le quartier abordable, fais pas venir plus d‚Äôanglos tabarnak!
What happens at nighttime?
That movie is hilarious, especially since some of the scenes were actually shot in Mile-End. :-)
Does anyone know that the Buddha hippy shop on Ontario and that dollar plus used to be an English language movie theatre back when
L'Avenue* Morgan. J'veux pas faire mon toponazi mais poser une question √† travers √ßa; quelle est la diff√©rence fondamentale entre une rue, une avenue, une place, un boulevard. On dirait que c'est choisi un peu al√©atoirement.
Je trouve qu‚ÄôHochelag‚Äô c‚Äôest un peu la vibe du Plateau/Petite-Patrie/Villeray dans les ann√©es ‚Äò90. Cette vie-l√†, tu l‚Äôavais presque partout avant.
Ce quartier a un charme sp√©ciale, c‚Äôest assez unique comparer √† le plateau mont Royal ou Villeray par example.
Good points! Also thank you!
Hey I‚Äôm always down for free pizza!
My memories of hochelag include riding a taxi & the poor taxi driver being harassed by prostitutes at red lights. Last time I visited hochelag it definitely looked like it was getting gentrified, hopefully the neighborhood has gotten better.
Merci beaucoup, avec toutes la positivit√© que je re√ßois dans ce subreddit c‚Äôest sur que je posterai encore:)
Unfortunately, I really hope it stays underrated, but doubt it.
Le quartier est vraiment pas pour tout le monde. J‚Äôy habite et j‚Äôadore, mais j‚Äôai jamais vu un quartier aussi sale de ma vie.

I like the layering in the photo.  It's just sad that all the nice elements in the photo are definitely not griffintown.
It‚Äôs a bougie, never ending construction, developing area where everyone dresses like they‚Äôre trying to be in a fashion magazine or going to New City Gas. The drugs must be potent in this area.
Well if you gonna repost, you're going to have to take a new pic from the same spot, show us how that building's coming along.
Wow! Really nice pic!
That's a great pic :)

What is the benefit of griffin town? Are all condos connected underground to the metro system even? If not, then really, what is the appeal.
Non, les riches sont grimp√©s en hauteur. On voit pas les sans-abris, junkies et la mis√®re quand on est asser loin.
tout cque jdis.
T'as raison, je me trompe tout le temps entre les deux.

There is zero metro access.  Zero good transit options.  Just people living on top of each other wondering what the fuck to do with themselves.
I live in griffintown, very close to this picture in fact. What I like is the proximity with downtown without being as expensive. Everything I need is walking distance. There is a bus across the street that brings you to the metro, but I‚Äôd rather just walk there, it‚Äôs really not that far.
Thank God I‚Äôm not the only one wondering. I worked a few weeks in Griffintown and hated it. Bad transit access and never ending traffic. I‚Äôm curious too
world gym is the only gym I could find with squat racks and deadlift platforms so I am forced to find a way into griffintown now. every other gym in montreal near me seems to be just a series of treadmills

REM Peel Basin?
Bonaventure metro is literally a 5-10 minute walk from Griffintown?
I always hated driving through Griffintown. It's just a bunch of twisty roads between empty lots and overpriced condos. It just had this dull, sterile feel about the place, and the people looked just as hollow.
I honestly thought all these new condos were connected to the metro. If not, then it‚Äôs an infrastructure nightmare.
What gym have you been visiting? Every gym I've been to had a squat rack and deadlift platform.
Even then, what a shit location.  You've already walked to the bonaventure at that point.  People on the guy/montagne side of griffintown will just walk all the way to the orange line or just up the hill.
They aren't. It's a sardine tin for people who want to live close to downtown. 
I see the appeal if your whole life is downtown and you want to live there. At least you can get a semi nice (if tiny) condo over a student apartment. But I can't imagine living there long term or raising kids there.
yea, some of them have *one*

Speaking of weeds - some madman pulled out almost all of the HUGE ragweed plants near me, that were along the sidewalk.
What a hero.
I actually live near that house lmaoo
¬´¬†Vu chez GND¬†¬ª.
Going out of business !
i‚Äôm so allergic to ragweed its not even funny.
My theory is that construction work is so poorly managed that, they have a crew that goes out and "prepares" the area before the actual construction crew comes to do the work, and they time it out poorly so the preparation is done many days before the construction begins. Just general mismanagement.
Companies used to get paid once they "started"   work.  l guess it is still the case.
[deleted]
you just dont ask questions like that... kinda like how you shouldn't ask why the f‚Å∞k they are taking up a lane with the tanker for watering the plants during peak rush hour
i think the corrupt private sector takes on more than they can actually finish without hiring more people, obviously don't hire more people, but keep all sorts of "sites" blocked off despite not working on them to justify continuing to charge the public. nationalize the construction industry under democratic workers' control.
Yeah, I went tot he office today for the first time since March 2020. Unfortunately the train shut down until 2024, so no choice but car. 0 traffic until I got downtown and then so much construction. Learned my lesson, not going back to the office every again (I don't have to).
There has to be corruption in this. Montreal ‚ÄúRoad works‚Äù is insane. It‚Äôs so clear that I can imagine the amount of money they spend on bribes to keep this up for years
Have any news reports / investigative journalists ever covered the Montreal construction topic? I've heard so many people say it's this way because of corruption, but like... has anyone tried to get to the bottom of it and solve the issue? Or does asking that question get you thrown to the bottom of the St Lawrence üëÄ
I work in roads in the big Montreal area. I regularly ask permits to municipalities for closing of either entire roads or specific lanes and also suggest alternatives for re-direction of traffic. I do not work in "construction" but rather in a firm that require some people to go on the field.
There are some case, pretty often, where the roads are closed, and we aren't working at that place at the moment. All of the times, it's just logistics. For ex: we can close several portions but only work inside them one at the time. When work is over inside one section, we re-open it right away and go inside the next. So we aren't all the time on site, but we might be coming in 2-3 hours, and re-open before sunrise.
I'm frustrated to know that so many people assume, without having any clue, that corruption or politic is involved.
Is it your first day in Montreal?
Why do they do it? Because fuck you that‚Äôs why.
Montreal is the kingdom of orange barrels. All praise the god of construction and road closures! ‚ÄúBarr√©, barr√©, barr√©, barr√©, barr√©, barr√©!¬†¬ª

Le classique de bloquer 2 coins de rue au complet pour faire un stationnement pour les gars du chantier
They‚Äôre just setting up for next month
It‚Äôs just so you don‚Äôt lose the habit ü§£ One day I saw a bunch of intersections closed like that on Rene-Levesque, and they made different cone patterns at each intersection, original patterns like triangles, zig zags and spirals, as if they were having fun trying to be creative. But there was not a single worker nor machinery anywhere! Then a few days later it was all gone, without any apparent work been done.
Welcome to mtl. Its part of the charm.
>Is construction company‚Äôs goal to make people‚Äôs day more miserable and create traffic ?
Yes.
It is a never-ending side quest.
I live there and it's been like this for about ten years between Atwater and Vinet. 
The work was first to do some maintenance work on the pipes and the connections to the buildings (one time they didn't do any clean up when they reconnected the main water line to the buildings, the dirt got in to everything and damaged and clogged the pipes, the city had to pay for the repairs.) They also been working on pipes breaking during winter. A few years back some of people on the other side of the building didn't water for a month due to construction.
One of the city's main water line is under the street and when they found out that it was 80% damaged they rushed to get it fixed and have been working in the area for three years now on it. The street drops to one lane on and off.
From the papers the city left on the building's door, they are supposed to work from Atwater to Rose de Lima this summer. Still didn't stop them to make some holes in the road east of Atwater last week and now have put those cones.
I think they are blocking from this spot to not create traffic jams when they get to the intersection and only have one lane west of Atwater. Hopefully they don't start working in front of my place, the noise is awesome when working from home.
Ive done this for 10 years and still have many friend still doing this with their own company. There is a lot of reason why... maybe the job was over and the contractor push the material on the sides of the road to allow acces even if hes not supposed to because he dont have the qualification or inssured to do so... there is a specific process to instal and remove material and yoh got to take a small class to do it.
Maybe they are actually waiting for the contractors to be ready to close and allowing acces in the mean time...
There are many reason possible
edit* i got home and took the time to check up the work they doing, OP just dont see the work farther ahead.
I‚Äôve always heard it‚Äôs this:
A company is working on project A while bidding on project B.  The city says they have to start work on project B on August 10th and the company says no problem.
The problem is the company can‚Äôt move their crew to project B until August 17th so to ‚Äúfulfill‚Äù their obligation to the city to start on the required date, the company puts up all the cones on August 10th.
Technically they‚Äôve started work, the road is closed, but the crew isn‚Äôt actually going to start on project B until project A is finished.
A construction company‚Äòs main goal is to make people miserable period.

It‚Äôs possible the work got called for rain
I don't think I've ever come across one construction site with workers on it in my entire life.
My god Montreal never ceases to amaze me with its incompetent city management
It's gotta be something to do with the fact that orange cones are rented for a dollar a day.
Dude on god I‚Äôve seen so many construction areas where there‚Äôs just no equipment or anyone there. Same place has been like that for months
Some people here are explaining why we have so much construction -- fair enough, the city is full of decrepit infrastructure, the water pipes and sewers are rotting apart and they can't even keep up with replacing / servicing them. And at the height of the construction corruption the jobs were done in such a pitiful way, they wouldn't last through the winter.
But OP asked about why are the road closures done in such a fuckwitted way. I'd attribute it mostly to incompetence and not giving a fuck. It's a multi-layered system of companies and sub-contractors, and nobody fully knows (or gives a shit) what's going on. Everybody just "does their job". 
For example, it's not usual to see groups of orange vest bros standing around doing fuck all - you'd thing they're lazy, but often it turns out they're waiting for whatever truck with whatever tool to show up and spend 20 minutes wrangling whatever thing before they can continue.
The real cold, indifferent incompetence is in the offices, where the cockroaches who plan these things are shielded from consequences. I've lived here long enough to see roads get fully resurfaced only to get cut up two weeks later for some other works & patched in the most half-assed way after. Cones closing off streets for days and days before construction starts? Par for the course, really.
One little anecdote really sums it up for me. I saw a pothole-fixing machine one day -- it's a weird little truck with various attachments. It had rained, so the potholes were full of water. The thing pulls up, extends a blower thingy, blows compressed air into the puddle.. the hole empties momentarily, then the water flows right back in. The operator proceeds to extrude asphalt into the "dried" hole, then another attachment comes out to press it down. And it continued down the road like that. The potholes were back within a week, the new asphalt chunked out of there real quick. But hey, union guy did his job, whatever was on the schedule, office guy did his job, whatever was in the plan. Not a spare fuck was given. And so she goes.
Crime
Maybe you are right? It seems it has been like that since forever : Montr√©al les c√¥nes. It has become a symbol for the city. You can buy pins, cushions, magnets, postal cards, etc. to their effigy.
Welcome to MTL
Scaffolding erection delayed by rain?
1. Construction companies are getting paid when they start a contract amd most of them rent the damn orange cones.
2. Urban planners are basically dumb f tards that I wouldn't trust to build even a house for a dog. I saw one can't even figure out how to setup his garden to be able to walk through it in order to harvest his raspberries.
3. Watch commission Charbonneau then cry.
4. If you are not drown in tears, well you must be working for the Mafia or live in a different province
Happens all the time it‚Äôs really annoying they don‚Äôt even do shit except block the road half the time
The Construction Cone Cartel
tbh its just poorly managed i think, during the covid lockdowns all the construction work sat there with empty roads, nothing being done, the second lockdown lifted they were back to blocking off streets.. like why not take advantage of there being no people to interrupt the work and get it done? makes no sense
[removed]
The reason for the cones is simple to protect workers from aggressive drivers. The reason they are set up with no apparent work is so that you have a mindset that you‚Äôre in a construction zone and therefore drive slowly. The main reason why cones are frustrating is that it appears that there is no central control over when one borough starts construction and another ends. They all pick the same time frame which affects the total commute time. So if you live in Lachine and work in Montr√©al-Nord. You could encounter 4-5 construction zones and this reduces travel time due to the fact that 3 lanes become 2 become 1 yet we have the same number of vehicles in the road. We need to find a way of fixing the problems when we have less vehicles on the road from 10 pm till 5am. And not all issues at the same time
In Quebec, either they block the road and no one is working or they have 6 workers standing around staring at one of them working, aka Poutine Paralysis Syndrome (PPS). And the Charbonneau commission was a huge waste of time and money. These Quebec construction companies have been pilfering our tax dollars for decades, basically untouched by well-greased politicians at *all* levels.
Not in alberta, those guys work from sunrise to sundown, they pave a 20 km highway in 2 weeks, never saw that elsewhere... I do not regret leaving mtl for this reason, not missing the no reason traffic they create.
Meanwhile when I lived in South Korea, they redid the asphalt on my street while I was at the bar. I once saw the work on another nearby road another day and it was like a team of 20 people. 
I remember when I would see 2-3 workers on Chemin Chambly on Longueuil when they redid the road a few years ago (one side per Summer). Not the same scale, but the fact that it was empty for 90% of the Summer was a big waste of time for everyone. 
That's how other places get whole metro lines  in the time and price of 2-3 stations.
Hi!   
For this intersection (Atwater and Saint-Antoine), the reason is because there is major waterworks happening on the other side of Atwater and the cones are meant to guide traffic in such a way as to not cause an accident.   
People fly down Saint-Antoine (many from outside of the neighbourhood) and are used to blasting through that light at all speeds, so we need to guide them BEFORE they arrive at the intersection.   
In this case, the number of lanes along Saint-Antoine will go from 3 to 1.   
(This construction is a continuation westward of the recent reconstruction of the very same pipeline which was completed east of Atwater and which is a major source of clean water for the city).   
Hope this helps!

WELCOME TO MONTREAL üòÅ
Sur la photo on voit que la rue est bloqu√©e √† l'intersection (pancarte orange avec fl√®che droite-gauche) et que les c√¥nes sont l√† pour s√©parer ceux qui vont √† droite de ceux qui vont √† gauche comme √ßa personne entre comme un fou dans le chantier. Si les gens conduisaient normalement, et voyaient normalement, contrairement √† OP, nous aurions droit √† moins de c√¥ne orange et surtout moins de mort sur les routes.
C'est vraiment /r/montreal √ßa se plaint de Montr√©al, mais c'est parce qu'ils sont aveugles.
Ou bien, c'est √† cause de Google Loi 101 ?
Yes exactly
Surveyors often need repeated access to the road surface with data processing required each time new measurements are taken... not much happens in between sometimes.
The real conspiracy is that they ordered too many cones to store in their warehouse so they have to leave a couple thousand laying around
It's part of the scenery, they're like modern trees for tourists and the population. They even added a bunch of pretty colours such as : blue, green, purple, another another shade of orange . Tell me if you catch a new colour.
It's part of mayor Plante's strategy to discourage people from using their car. So many streets have been blocked for no reason in the last few years, and then when they remove the road blocks months later, the asphalt hasn't even been touched.
drivers on st-antoine: how does this city expect me to get around with only two lanes on this street plus eight lanes on the highway parallel to here plus three more on st-jacques and six more on rene-levesque all 500 metres apart?
me, biking home on st-antoine: i hope i don‚Äôt get killed in the dooring zone today.

Un rappel, les r√®gles du sub s'appliquent quand m√™me.
I was downtown near the bell center yesterday and due to the habs game the police presence was absurd. No joke, close to one cop per pedestrian. 
I noticed about a third of the cops were wearing a thin blue line badge on their uniforms. I asked a police officer if it represented the same thing to them as the ‚Äúthin blue line‚Äù in the states and got the nice reply; ‚Äúsi tu sais d√©j√† c‚Äôest quoi pourquoi tu me demande, fais moi pas perdre mon temps‚Äù. 
Am i the only one feeling icky about these cops thinking they‚Äôre the line holding back civilization from descent into chaos?
Absolutely not! I know at my work I'm not permitted to wear any politically charged clothing, masks, or patches. Seeing how they are supposed to be public servants being paid with our tax dollars I don't really understand how this isn't being shut down by leadership.
No, it's divisive and they should know better.
"If the police don't want to be viewed as an occupying army, maybe they shouldn't be flying their own separate flag"
https://i.redd.it/eb6u5xwjsp271.jpg
For the exact same reason we want to ban religious symbol from public institution, we should also ban any political sign. 
Obviously the fact that the sign is an extremist one makes the thing even worse.
Non.
C'est r√©pugnant.
Be very very careful around these people, they are not here to protect you.
A gang wearing gang insignia? Not surprising.
I had a RCMP officer come into my connivence store with the Thin Blue Line Canada Flag posted not just on their uniform, but OVER the Canada Flag. I was not happy that day after seeing that.
Don't forget to @spvm on twitter to pressure them. They need to feel that it's not acceptable.
La police a Montr√©al a aucun respect de l'uniforme.... Ils portaient des pantalons de clown lors des derni√®res n√©gociation syndicale...
I don't care because... I don't expect much better of police. If anything it makes it easier for me to identify the problematic ones. In fact, I wish all the ones who really resonate with this message had the guts to wear them so we can all see just how big of a problem it is.
yikes.
Where can I get one to display on my dash when I get pulled over?
They like to cosplay American cops.
What a bunch of trash.
No. 
First of all, its American bs. Them wearing it shows they have been fully colonized/Americanized and have lost all connection to their cultural origins.
Number 2: a large number of criminal and terrorist organization wear the same symbol. By wearing these, agents show they don't believe in the rule of law. Wish they swore to protect.
Firable offense, no pension.
No it‚Äôs a gang sign
Fuck non. ACAB.
Ils ne portent m√™me plus de bleu, ils sont pass√© au noir pour se sentir plus *bad ass* en 2013. Alors la ligne bleue l√†...
Funny thing: if you try to report a racial attack on the spvm website, you get a 404 error...
On ne peut pas avoir de voile en position d'autorit√© mais les policiers peuvent s'habiller en clown en contestation syndicale ou porter un signe limite de gang policier montrant leurs all√©geances politiques ü§°
Did you file a complaint? https://spvm.qc.ca/en/Contact
They should be wearing their official duty uniform and not a thing more, not a thing less! Especially no controversy symbols defending brutality and racism or that adds to their overpowering feeling....
If they can‚Äôt respect simple authority rules such as an official, neutral uniform, then who will? They are supposed to represent law and rules, not break them.
Not surprised. Few years back they were wearing camo pants in protest regarding their pension reforms. We all know what they were saying with that. They could've worn fedoras or armbands. They instead chose to wear camo to remind us that they're kind of like the military in that they have guns, are organized, and will use force as their primary tool.
They also plastered their vehicles with stickers. Those eventually needed to be removed. Not sure who paid the bill on that. Probably the tax payers.
And then there was that time when their union did the traditional protest, signs and marching. Only difference was they eventually entered a government building and trashed the place while the cops just looked on. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details with that one. As you can imagine, searching that topic - cops, protest, storming government building - gets a lot of results, but not the results I'm looking for.
This is a gang sign.
Pardon my ignorance but what does a thin blue line means?
Reminds me off the douchebags wearing punisher skulls.  
https://www.newsweek.com/punisher-police-blue-lives-matter-skull-logo-1449272#slideshow/1512286
I work at a bar, it's normal to see cops coming over to regulate how many people you have in your bar. A good portion of them had that flag on them
ACAB, never forget it
1312
No. Fucking cops.
Gross. These people make themselves out to be heroes when fishermen, loggers, miners work more dangerous jobs. These are suburbanites that "suit up" and come into Montreal like they're going to war. They're bullies looking for a fight.
Looks like an overt religious symbol to me.
u/CraigSauve Is this acceptable for our police force?
They chose to be cops. So really it's no fault but their own. 
You can't choose your skin colour.
Hard no. It's basically a statement that one wrong move justifies any degree of escalation they deem necessary.
An argument for bill 21 is often that people in these positions need to show neutrality or unbias, and that wearing symbols like a hijab or a kippah, and not being able to remove it to work in these positions, makes them biased. They often use the analogy that wearing political symbols in a public setting will just infuriate people for no reason and so don't wear it in public or when working. This cop is in public, working, and some are often openly aggressive when questioned about the thin Blue line flag, so I just want to know if others have heard this hypocritical crap.
I wonder how many men they have to screw and suck-off or how many bodies they dumped in the Saint Lawrence River to earn that patch.
No it shouldn‚Äôt be allowed
What does a thin blue line badge mean tho?
Police officers are disgusting people.  And really, really stupid by design.
No and it probably means they have other problematic ideas also.
Fuck no
Of course not.
The real question is who do we need to contact to put an end to this absurdity?
No, they shouldn't and they know they shouldn't.  The city does not have full control of it's police force and this is a prime example bc Plante will say all the right things but some cops won't give a shit about what their boss thinks.
SVPM are wildly incompetent at the best of times.
It‚Äôs absolutely unacceptable.  This badge just shows that they are more loyal to themselves than to justice.  It‚Äôs just a badge to pridefully show that they‚Äôre gang just like the dudes they arrest.
These things are a gigantic red flag to me at this point.
They make the dozen or so good cops look bad...
The idea of the alert is fine but the sound itself is way too intense and doesn't match how you're supposed to react. The sound implies imminent danger if you don't react immediately this second. In reality it's more of a heads up, keep an eye out for this. The sound should reflect that. No need to trigger an adrenaline rush and fight / flight response. Plus if you're at home the alert means basically nothing, it's only useful when you're out. 
A good idea implemented badly, bureaucracy at its finest.
The kid is now safe.
I‚Äôm not mad that we get these alerts, i just can‚Äôt believe Canada bungled the implementation of this system so poorly that domestic disputes nearly an entire province away are treated with the same severity and urgency as an incoming nuclear missile. 
I just ignore them now. That‚Äôs not a good thing.
It happened at 6:15 last night in fucking Val Dor...
Why the fuck did they wake me the fuck up in Montreal at 1:15 AM? The chances I have a fucking Mazda in my fucking bed is about 0.
I though we were getting nuked, it scared the fuck out of me
ikr thank god my phone is always on vibrate
I hope they had a good reason not to wait before dawn as this contributes to people disabling the alert
Triggered my PTSD bad. I was in a really large earthquake and heard the exact same noise before seeing a lot of catastrophe. Took me hours to calm down last night.
I would have much preferred a text with all necessary information and pictures of the person/car. Could have checked in the morning and actually looked out for the vehicle.
Imagine how bad it sounds when your high as fuck
How are we even supposed to read them? It makes that noise until you swipe it away. Are they expecting me to listen to that horrible sound?
I‚Äôm complaining lol. Do they do any studies on excess heart attacks the day after amber alerts sent during the night?
A few million people got that. They already found just the clock shift of daylight savings kills people every year. You gotta figure using an air raid siren would have a similar effect.
**Edit:** according to this study you‚Äôd expect a 20% daily boost in heart attacks from an hour of lost sleep. That amounts to an excess four deaths in the Montreal area at the prevailing Canadian rate! Check my comment below for the math. No way this alert was justifiable on a population level. 
This sounds extreme but the math checks out. 
https://openheart.bmj.com/content/1/1/e000019
The fact that the sound used for amber alerts is the same one used in Japan for tsunami warnings is so ridiculous. Especially when it‚Äôs past midnight.
Yeah this is the same sound they use when there‚Äôs a severe storm warning, which is the first instance I heard it. Whenever I hear it I always think I‚Äôll have to go find shelter. Amber alerts are useful, but the sound is not proportional to the action citizens should take. Maybe a different beeping would be actually more effective.
My immediate reaction was to close the message to stop the sound. I didn't even read the message
I program for a living and I was deeply, Deeply, DEEPLY concentrating on some complicated code. At that moment, this was my entire universe, nothing else existed. And that fricking alarm goes off. I swear to god I almost fell out of my chair -- and I mean this literally not figuratively -- I almost fell out of my chair. 
Mark my words, this thing is going to kill somebody one day.
Yeah, i am done trusting the government with how to use it best. This shot gave my father some "malaises cardiaques". Is anybody know how to uninstall this.
This is fucked up. My wife jumped off the bed screaming from fear and my one year of woke up crying. I am fuming right now‚Ä¶ there is no way this is right way to go about things.
Tip of the night: Do Not Disturb and vibration off, when you plan to sleep‚Ä¶
I was in a bar and the place lit up with that noise. It was surreal.
God forbid this happens to a loved one of yours, just quit complaining lol
Ils ont besoin de repenser cette id√©e. R√©veiller les gens parce que une grosse tornade s‚Äôen vient, c‚Äôest une bonne id√©e. Mais comment une personne (~70 ans) qui dort dans son lit peut retrouver un enfant kidnapp√©. Excellente intention qui requiert une meilleure id√©e plus efficace.
agree, they are very important but god I wish they could change it to a less jarring sound
I wish there was a way to ‚Äòopt out‚Äô of the audio signal. People with disabilities and seniors, people in hospital, with severe mental health issues, are all people who can‚Äôt help anyway. Yet they are startled and confused by these alerts. Even if I am asleep, I am not available to search for anything. I‚Äôll see the alerts the minute I‚Äôm awake and will certainly do what I can to help. But there is no need to blast out whole schools, hospitals, and nursing homes with these things.
I was on the phone with somebody else both were stunned. I don't mind it but let's have it silent at this hour.
there was a second one? or my phone decided to just play it twice
Quand votre petit confort est plus important que l'alerte. Ridicule.
Depends the phone, 
I wish I could easily either lower the sound, change the sound to something more friendly or mute it when I am in 'Do not disturb mode'. 
As said these are useful stuff, but we definitely need a sleep mode at least for AMBER alert as you are unlikely to go for hunt. Plane mode is not an acceptable solution (think about on call people for example).
Enforcing users to have no way to tune things a little (on my S9 everything is grayed out) is only going to make them do bypass it or shutdown all alerts of this kind while I am sure, no one would complain on daytime hours.
Just make it more user friendly, people are still going to help.
My 2cts.
Both my phone and my gfs phone rang at the same tome lol we panicked. We thought the building was on fire or something.
Didn't hear it. My phone is in DND mode At night and I didn't hear it
Did you guys also get 4 of them or was that just me
We should be allowed to have an 8 hour period where  alerts can be disabled.
Lol i was sleeping then i get fucked by the alarmüò≠
I don't know why, I did not heard it. It's not the first time the phone never rang.
Guess I‚Äôm going to start turning my phone off when I go to bed.
It should definitely be a calmer alert sound‚Ä¶ anyone who is awake and able to help wouldn‚Äôt need a terrifying alert to hear it and anyone asleep is no help anyway so it could be calmer‚Ä¶
Man I had to laugh at that last sentence because I felt the same thing!!! Jumped out of bed and was ready to rumble.
Yes, totally agree. I don't think the amber alerts are wrong, but I have anxiety and one amber alert I heard sent me into a full panic attack. It was the one a few months ago about the water situation in Nova Scotia or something.
Especially with the pandemic and shit. For all you know, there could be flaming balls hitting the Earth.
I was watching true crime videos, imagine how I felt lol
My phone was on Do Not Disturb, and no sound happened! I was surprised!
Someone made a comment in another post a while back that the phone aleert are misused, something about using maximum level of urgency instead of putting the level way lower than it should be
me too!! i couldn‚Äôt sleep all night i thought about her and it woke me up so violently
I sleepily Googled information from the text (name, place, amber alert) and there was literally no news, at least in English. The message isn't in my texts, so unless I memorized the details I wouldn't have been able to help, even if I saw the car. 
It seems very poorly implemented.
Mine didn't ring, I saw the alert in the morning when I woke up, try setting up your phone on "do not disturb" between midnight and 6 am
It makes sense if there is some imminent danger to life like a tornado or an asteroid.  Bad for just about anything else.  Random child abductions somewhere within a few hundred miles or whatever should not be treated the same as that.  That should maybe just be an advisory that pops up on your phone with default ringtone.
I work in the security and 5 cell phone just rang. I thought there was a goddamm fire in the building. I had to disable this before it rang more during my night shift.
If you don't want to be disturbed when sleeping put your phone in airplane mode and open the wifi
You know. I hated the 3:00 am amber alerts before I had kids. 
Now that I have kids, i hate them even more. 
I ain‚Äôt getting out of bed to organize a search party. They can wait until 8.
That sounds it makes is awful but the concept is great. I am a nurse and every hair on my body stands on it‚Äôs end when it makes that noise. It‚Äôs the sound of a code from hell or something. I immediately feel someone is dying and I have no clue where they are.
Lol I was thinking the same thing. That first beep damn near gave me a heart attack
Great work! But maybe complete the bridge so that it doesn‚Äôt look like people would just drive off it?
You need one with just an orange cone... >\_<
Do you sell those? If yes where can I find these?
They'd make awesome coasters, i'd buy a set!
What is the orange one?
Do you sell those? If yes where can I find these?

I love this. Are you selling prints?
I like it. Got more?
Very nice!
Pretty much nailed it. Keep up the nice work!
Looks great
What about Mount Royal, and the cross?
Great work
Nice and old school. Thanks for the memories.
.... what's the middle top row one
Amazing work! I would consider adding an orange cone!
Would make great pins! Good job!
You need to make one with Rue Barree; then its truly Montreal :)
nice work mate
What does the middle one represent?
mint them as NFTs and sell them
these are awesome!! I could definitely picture these on hoodies or tshirts
If you haven't already, definitely look into NFTs
See if you can get a shot of the Old Port with the Grande Roue, a terrifying big wheel 20 storeys high. Half as high as the London Eye. And Place Jacques-Cartier is amazing in summer and early fall.
I don't know what the basket ball thing is, but for me personally, the most obvious landmarks are the 1000 de la Gauchetiere tower and the Biosphere.
I like how you've let the Olympic Stadium stick outside of the circle!
So.. the Big O, Habitat, and Farine Five Roses are bathing in toxic sludge?
On the other hand, it captures the perpetual state of construction we find ourselves in
I thought it was old Champlain mid demolition for a second, then I saw La Ronde in the background.
Omg i was like what orange cone. Then i realized you mean Pilons
Send me a dm, I‚Äôm happy to custom create a print for you!
Send me a dm, I‚Äôm open to making coasters!
Orange Julep :)

Construction cones lol
Great work, thanks.
Hey! I'm down to buy the full res copies for these :) I want to dye them onto golf discs. LMK if you're selling the digital copies and how much.

This just looks like normal Verdun.
[Here's the obligatory instagram link.](https://www.instagram.com/apocalypse_montreal/) And fuck it, here's a song, to the tune of Gilbert and Sullivan's Modern Major General.
&#x200B;
I am the very model of a model-making general, the dioramas I create: improba-buh-ly minuscule,   
I obsess over details that are practically invisible, and replicate my town in a dystopia infeasible.  
The biosphere is crumbling, but something's happening underground,   
The metro cars at Namur crashed, and no survivors have been found,  
From Schwartz's to the Gibeau d'orange, and the cross on Mount Royale, I recreate my city (small) and proceed to destroy it all.
I customize my tiny guys with plates of gravy, cheese, and fries, and squint my eyes to paint them all at such an inconvenient size.
Then place them in a tableau with precision that is surgical, to satirize the effects of capitalism: terminal.  
I'll terrorize my city with imagination most savage, I'll slam a bus into your home and get paid for the privilege. In matters post-apocalyptic, cyberpunk, and Montreal, I am the very model of a model-making general.
I really love how you incorporate tags we already see around the city! I‚Äôve seen Monet and the wild world itself is holy a couple of times. Amazing work
This is amazing, great detail‚Ä¶ love this city and your interpretation of it.
Is that the office de la langue fran√ßaise enforcement team because of non-bilingual graffiti? :)
Jokes aside, this looks amazing!
Les gens se font encore swatter apr√®s l'apocalypse?
J'aime le SMILE en haut a gauche. Nice touch!
It must be possible for you to find a store front window to set all these models you made in to compete against Olgivy's Christmas display.
Maybe even consider reaching out to the nuit blanche people.
These deserve to be displayed in public some how
I want to see the whole plateau form you. Or st cath street. Merge your mode into a city and shoot it with a mini cam
Post-apocalyptic ? You mean Hochelaga ?
the details are amazing!
Really cool man.
Thats fucking awesome
Ha. La crise d'octobre !
These are great but I don't think you need to call these portrayals as post apocalyptic.  You could call it verdun on Saturday etc...

Coool
I have to say, I've seen all of your posts here and I have to admit you do a great job of never going overboard. Everything always seems so believable. Those plastic chairs just sells it all perfectly.
Oh my god the tiny Stikki Peaches Sinatra!!! This is sooo sick
Are those Ripleys boots you're wearing? Tight!
Cute!!
I love this. I used to live in Rosemont, my mother still resides there. Great work.
Is that a Make noize smiley face?

Not from Montreal, in this sub because I'm considering moving there, and your works happens to be a really good advertisement. It looks amazing!
Visited Montreal for the first time a couple weeks ago and fell in love with the city !
ouah les petites touches de rouille sur l'escalier, bravo

Thanks!
Thanks, I had an especially fun time making this one.
Actually, all the SWAT models were pulled from Ubisoft Montreal's Rainbow Six Seige, for a little more hometown flavor.
I don't know if this is a longer answer than you're looking for, but I'm trying to explore different "flavors" of the apocalypse, and how they might work together. Climate change denial and alt-right politics seem to go hand in hand, so yeah, I can definitely see the rise of facism as directly relating to the apocalypse. I think of it as kind of like an apocalyptic singularity that we're working towards, politically, economically, etc.
That comes courtesy of Makenoize, they've been putting smiles around town for over a decade now. We've chatted a bit, super nice dude. :)
Nuit Blanche isn't a bad idea.
That's not a bad idea.
Everyone knows a neighborhood shittier than anything I could come up with. :P
Thanks! Yeah, I get that a lot. If I'm being honest,  when I say post-apocalyptic, I really mean cyberpunk, but I don't know if that would confuse some people.
Really nice of you to say,  thanks!
I didn't realize it when I was making the character,  but the shoes totally look like Reebok Stompers. Must have been a subconscious thing.
Thanks! I'm just a few blocks away in Little Italy. Beautiful neighborhoods both.
Thanks! That is hands down the funniest compliment to my work that I've ever gotten. Imagine seeing these models in the tourist brochures. :P

This is in part to move _up_ pre-scheduled 2nd doses, right? I already have an appointment for my 2nd dose scheduled for September, so this is simply an opportunity to move things up, and help compress the schedule for QC-wide vaccination that much more?
great, I don't have to wait until AUGUST.
so this is when you can start BOOKING the appointments? I went to Clic Sante but there was nothing yet.
On dirait qu'ils veulent bumper ca ass√© vite.  Mes parents ag√©s qui habitent dans les Laurentides ont √©t√© appel√©s Samedi pass√© et ont recu leurs 2e dose lundi apr√®s 7 semaines.
Getting closer to the 3 week recommended wait time between doses :)
I wonder if these spots will open up the day before like the first shot appointements
Is anybody aware of the new timetable for immunocompromised people? For the first dose we received it earlier than our age groups because of health conditions. I wonder where we fit in now or should I just wait until my age group this time around?
j'ai d√©j√† un rendez-vous pour le mois d'aout.  
J'imagine qu'il va falloir que j'aille sur clic-sant√© pour l'annuler et reprendre un nouveau rendez vous en esp√©rant ne pas me faire "shafter" ?
I got my first dose back in April, but my age group is only allowed to rebook 2nd appointments on the 22nd... for me that will already be passed the 8 week mark. Does anyone know if it's possible to book the 8 weeks even if your age group isn't allowed yet? My time will end up being 11-13 weeks instead of 16 which is not a big dif...
Thanks. Does this apply to mix and match doses too?
Where do those of us who got in early as essential workers fall in this?
Isn't there an earlier option for people with health issues? It's a bit weird if my girlfriend will have to wait later than most for her second shot just because she is younger, despite being chronically ill.
So no dates for the at risk & immunocompromised?
YAY! So happy!
J'ai eu ma deuxi√®me dose mercredi dernier, j'ai 38 ans. Je suis enseignant et c'√©tait le jour de la vaccination pour les √©l√®ves, ils ont d√©cid√© d'offrir la deuxi√®me dose √† tout le personnel qui avait attendu assez longtemps depuis la premi√®re (j'en √©tais √† un peu plus de 6 semaines). Mon rendez-vous √† l'origine √©tait le 8 ao√ªt.
It‚Äôs incredible watching all the people in this comment section be nothing but helpful, supportive and insightful. This pandemic has brought us closer and made us stronger. Montreal together ‚ô•Ô∏è
Do the appointments go by birth year or actual age?
For AZ 12 weeks in between doses is still the ideal for max protection.
My second appointment is on 3rd september. it was a company my brother works for and they vaccinated relatives as well.
wonder if that could be moved as well.
If I have to move to Toronto, can I take my second dose in there ?
do walk-in accept 2nd dose people?
This is awesome.  Watch all the dummies come up some some fucked up conspiracy.
8 weeks = 56 days.
Pfizer recommends 21 days between doses, so why 8 weeks?
So, you must have 8 week minimum between both doses? I wonder if it will let me book even it's less than 8.
Thank you.
Any word on the under 12 approval?  Sure my daughter isn't high risk but it would be nice to have the peace of mind.
So they're asking people to wait 8 weeks between doses?
I got mine on May 21st can i schedule on June 21st for an appointment on July 21st?
Thanks for sharing. My boyfriend and I have recently moved to Montreal. We got our first shot in Toronto. Do you think we'll be able to get our second dose in Montreal? Or will we have to travel back for it? Thanks!
Donc √ßa va v√©rifier le 8 semaines et permettre de prendre une date apr√®s, c'est bien √ßa?
Dans mon cas le 8 semaines arrive le veille de mon groupe d'√¢ge, donc j'esp√®re pouvoir courir trouver une annulation!
Does anyone know if its okay to take our 2nd shot appointment at a different clinic than our 1rst one?
Are people still having success with just showing up to a major vaccination site late in the day or extra doses? I never bothered trying for the 1st dose, but my 8 weeks is up next week and I'm curious. Might try a drive thru site?

I still didn't find a reason to do vaccine don't get me wrong I am not anti vaxx but I am taking my time non of my friends took it or taking it, maybe if its mandatory ill take it but for now ill wait worst case ill die from covid meh ill just see my parents
Correct.
Yup. You can keep your september appointment if you want to.
Correct, this is when rebooking opens.
My mom got her first dose in April and second dose was schedule for August too lol
For what it's worth waiting 2~3 months gets you better immunity overall, so yeah it's cool to be saying "I'm double vaxxed", but taking your time isn't inherently bad.
Holy shit folks you need to learn a little french lol
a la mega clinique de montreal nord (place bourassa)  ya maintenant une section sans RDV.
2 de mes clientes ont eu leur 2ieme dose hier "en passant par la" elles ont arrett√© pour s'informer, et vu que leur premiere etait en debt mars, elles ont eu leur 2ieme sur le champ!
Id prefer the 8-12 week gap as it seems to provide better protection. 
https://globalnews.ca/news/7861754/pfizer-vaccine-second-dose-delay/
three week recommendation as that is how they were tested. Generally a four month booster for a vaccine is better (more spaced out is better) so we seem to be getting the best of both worlds with this.
Clicsant√© will only offer you appointments that are >8 weeks after your first dose however.
I'll be keeping an eye on it 48hrs before my age comes up ;)
4:20 PM booking time is best time üíâ
I'm gonna be checking here the day before so mes chers fellow redditors can alert me if that is the case
"People who are highly immunosuppressed or who are on dialysis are considered to have a very high risk of complications from COVID-19. These people will be able to get the 2nd dose of vaccine 28 days after the 1st dose. The people concerned will be contacted to schedule their appointment."

You are allowed to get your 2nd dose after 4 or 6 weeks I believe. Friend of mine who has a an immune disorder got his pretty soon after his 1st.
I have a patient who is immunocompromised and he already got his second dose. You should be able to go get one I would guess. Try one of the places that has walk in appointments
You should be able to get it sooner, like 4 weeks, call your doctor or pharmacist.
This was so obvious to predict. Force every store to close at 7:30 and create a new rush-hour. Brilliant. Did they add more buses to accommodate the extra load? Nope.
i used to shop in an empty provigo at 9pm. i really don't understand the logic of making me shop in a packed provigo at 6:30
Interesting.  At my job there are some people that work 11am till 7:30pm and take public transportation.  Last week I heard them talking about how the bus is so much more crowded at 7:45pm.  Knowing the route they were talking about I'm guessing the new passengers were workers from the nearby Adonis and IGA.
I've also noticed that capacity in stores like Walmart and Dollarama has stayed the same pre and post " Cirquit Breaker" lockdown despite many sections in both stores being closed to the public.
They had all summer to prepare teachers for remote teaching.  But no, they send kids, known superspreaders, to schools.  What does closing grocery stores early accomplish?  It is a fucking joke.  They might be clinically retarded.
It's insane. This Friday, between the curfew and the snowstorm coming, I went to grocery shop at Maxi and the line to get in went around the building. Once inside, the line to the registers went around the store all the way back to the frozen section. Insane!!!! What's the point???
Cest fucking cave all I gotta say. Ive been super scared of public transit since last march and I can‚Äôt imagjne how it must be stressful for essential workers who have to take it during those hours. Ugh!!! Im sorry
[deleted]
Can you please put some pictures up at some point? Media traction might help build some pressure against extending it when the time comes.
Folks, don't believe the news saying this is all spread in homes and by irresponsible travelers. It is definitely being spread in public places, transport and stores, and very much underreported because of lack of contact tracing. If you can't stay >3 (yes THREE) meters away and wear a tight fitting mask stay away from crowded spaces. The curfew is just going to exacerbate this situation
PrEnEZ lE tRaNsPoRT eN cOmMuN Qui DiSAiT!
Yup. Used to commute to work since March.   
Thankfully, since July I've had the opportunity to often drive to and from work.
But, I hate the days where I have to take public transport. None of this makes sense.   
And there's always some moron with their mask off. And yes, everyone will passively glare at them while not batting an eye at the person who absolutely must sip their Tim Horton's on the fucking train/bus. Then Bonaventure...the homeless...yes, the homelessness issue is a complex matter on its own and I don't place the blame on them, but their gathering in that metro is an absolute shitshow. 
I've spent so much time keeping occupied, ignoring the way I'm getting absolute assfucked as an "essential worker", ignoring how none of the procedures in place make sense. But, as this goes on, I want to scream at someone, I want to drive my heel into the nose bridge of the next person I see without a mask in the metro, I just want to lose it. But, I'm a reasonable person. I hate having misplaced anger with barely any outlets left.
Obviously the guy directly responsible for 5000+ deaths in long term health care homes will try to scapegoat everything and everybody else before he admits his incompetence.
I feel the curfew doesnt do anything. The issue is that with metro and school, like you said metro is packed.
I havent been to the metro since lockdown, but from your post, it seems tight, no wonder there are still lot of cases.
I always see at least one person in every metro car pulling down their mask to eat, pulling it down to talk, having their nose sticking out the whole time, etc etc. with that person spewing their aerosols all over the metro car.
For example, I was on the bus last week, and 2 people came in without wearing masks, talking, yawning and shouting. Aerosols spreading all over the entire bus. Moving away only works so much when you're in a bus with windows that don't open.
The bus drivers don't care at all...although you'd think they would care more, since most don't wear masks and their plexiglass shield doesn't extend to the ground all the way, therefore they're sharing our air space. I guess the STM hasn't acknowledged aerosol spread?
At this point I take the bus or metro twice a day every day as an essential worker, and despite wearing eye protection and PM 2.5 filters in a 4 layer mask, constantly moving between metro cars to avoid people and choose the least crowded one...I've resigned myself to the fact that I'll get COVID.
I‚Äôm waiting for a news article saying a cop stopped a bus driver or a snow clearing person to ask why they were out after 8. At this point I‚Äôm not being sarcastic, I can reasonably see them being stopped after work. Le couvre feu est illogique et de mon avis cruelle pour tous le monde qui suivait les r√©glementations comme il faut. En m√™me temps √ßa n‚Äôadresse pas les faits dans le syst√®me qui sont les transmetteurs plus dangereux du virus.
Just going to lay this out here: one of my teachers grew up in a war-torn country and didn‚Äôt really go to elementary school at all. He had two PhDs and a uni admin job. If the kiddos had to miss a year of going to school in person (and I know it would be INCONVENIENT for parents but you know what‚Äôs also inconvenient? A full ICU. Overworked hospitals.) anyway that‚Äôs my two cents. I‚Äôm not an expert, I can just count and use common sense to know that 20 ppl in a bus or 40 ppl in a classroom is kind of nuts right now.
Yes, public transport is absurd. I haven't been on a bus since curfew, but last month when I was going back home, the green line was down so we had to take a shuttlebus. I thought surely they would restrict the number of people getting on. NOPE! Packed like sardines. smh

>  C'est lit√©ralement boucher un trou tout en en per√ßant un autre ailleurs. 
Non, c'est lit√©ralement percer un trou sans boucher un autre trou :P   
If you remember, in the evenings before curfew the streets were empty anyway. Even grocery stores around 8-9 were almost totally empty. Occasionally you'd get a few people in deps grabbing beers before 11pm.   
The idea is to limit gatherings but frankly, there is nothing stopping people from staying overnight. The gatherings won't stop, they'll just go on longer. For people with vehicles, if they sign up to be Uber Eats etc drivers they can come and go freely anyway.   
What is happening, though, is that more people are being laid off from fast food places (due to no drive-through) and grocery stores (due to cut hours). Basically, those people who can't afford to be laid off. And more homeless are being crammed into small shelters.  
We're basically increasing the spread, giving people anxiety - my gf was heading home the other night and there was a metro outage about an hour before curfew...fun - and getting more people laid off. For no benefit.  
With the first lockdown, absolutely everything was closed. I thought it was overkill and could have been handled better, but at least it *worked.* By summer we were sitting pretty. This? This is a shitshow.

D'habitude je fais mon √©picerie apr√®s 20h; la place est vide, c'est moins stressant, √ßa me fait une marche de soir√©e pis j'ach√®te moins de junk quand j'y vais apr√®s souper donc j'ai pas faim.
Depuis 2 semaines je dois me taper le rush hour. La file d'attente pour les caisses dans l'all√©e des surgel√©s va jusque au fonds de l'√©picerie, le monde se fonce dedans. 
Y'a une autre file avant d'entrer sur le trottoir, on se g√®le le cul et la morve coule √† flots, le monde renifle et a les mains dans la face. 
On est oblig√© de se prendre et manipuler un panier qui n'est d√©contamin√© qu'en apparences, 'parce que c'est la proc√©dure'. 
√áa me prends 45 minutes au lieu de 15 minutes normalement.
Coudonc, je dois √™tre un complotiste moi aussi parce que je trouve que √ßa fait aucun sens.
I hope the curfew is the final straw before people start to wake up.
Ish, je vais prendre le bus demain matin, c'est la m√™me chose le matin selon tes observations? Je croise les doigts pour √™tre assez t√¥t pour √©viter cela.
edit: pas trop de monde dans le bus ce matin, assez relax
I do think that certain elements could have been thought of better, but the point is to reduce the chance of it spreading. People need public transit, you can't stop public transit, but people don't need to be clumped together in Starbucks. So you are reducing the risk at Starbucks' (and other stores). 
But yes, the transport bottlenecks in the evening should have been thought of better.
I am lucky to have the possibility to work from home. For groceries I now take a break in the middle of my work day to go because orherwise it's not safe at all. I understand the reason for curfew but honestly it creates more problems than it solves. Sucks that we got to this point. (Looking at you Covidiots and Anti-maskers)
This is so absurd, this is the sort of bullshit that makes me not mad at the anti-maskers, because this jarring crap that results in people already faced with a glut of good information leads them to reject it more when it is so visibly nonsensical. 
It was pretty bad with the sealed off buses in the summer too and I had to take it for some very essential reasons, very frequently. 
This is after the fact that it is pretty well known how ventilation helps, how low income countries with concrete frame structures and no HVAC (no sealed buildings) were actually able to combat it better.
One needs n95 masks which are still impossible to find. The kn95 ones have good filtration but are terrible at fitting the face and let air leak.
This would go a good way to protecting the public
Les gouvernements doivent avoir le courage de leurs convictions en ce moment.
Il ne l'ont tout simplement pas.
They should‚Äôve put the curfew during the holidays when it‚Äôs the time most people would feel to meet family/friends, especially on NYE, no point now..,
Met someone who's been partying every weekend like 20+ ppl - the curfew definitely helps to curb things like that from happening I think.
Preach
Agreed... every time I go by a bus stop with my car, my heart jumps when I see people in the bus so close to each other and so many people waiting to get on... : (
it isn't just at night.
I take the 115 down Pare from Namur to work in the morning, it was shoulder to shoulder people today and most mornings.. the evening home (4:30 pm) isn't any better....

Density made all the sense in the world until a pandemic hit the city.
Now, airborne pandemics should never not be a consideration when deciding to live in 900 sqr feet in 40 storey towers all while relying on sitting like sardines in crowded underground tubes to get around the city.
I have no idea what this means for the future of dense city development but trying to find work where you are 100% at home is probably a good place to start.  Then maybe the people who have no choice but to use transit have a bit more space.
I am genuinely sorry and fucking sucks.
I have the luck and privilege to WFH, despite being considered a "nom team player" by my boss now. I am really lucky.
I agree with a lot of the sentiments here and I think it would be interesting to check out more data.
It would be exciting and interesying to see propositions by people in this sub. If not to send as an official proposal, but to see how we, the Reddit MTL population, vary in thoughts, philosophy and ideas and if we get any good and actionable ideas. Personally I would close businesses also for a full month, but I am aware how much that would cost and have no solution to the economic consequences.
I feel like I'm playing Democracy but with real consequences. Actually... It would be interesting is all citizens who intend to go into politics had to play Democracy a minimum of 60 hours.
100% spot on, there's very little research or data being used to inform any of this.
I haven't taken public transit in a while exactly because of this. We were probably 25+ people in a bus in December and it gave me paranoia.
We have to do something. The curfew is something. Therefore we need a curfew... /s
I understand, but didn't science and everyone agree that wearing masks and staying 2 meters apart are the best fight against the spread? The biggest activity that was supposedly spreading the virus was home gatherings where people weren't wearing masks. 
With the curfew, as much as I hate it, this activity is stopped. It stops people from gathering in homes, or it at least makes it MUCH more difficult to go to someone's house illegally. 
Before the curfew, it was legal for me to get into my car, and drive all the way to a friend's house. So long as I didn't get out of my car and enter their home. As long as I entered the house discretely, nothing would be done. The cops weren't doing random house calls, if nobody saw me enter their house, nobody would call the cops. 
NOW, with the curfew, I'm not even allowed to get that far. I'm not even allowed to get into my car after 8pm. If I'm caught even being outside I could get in trouble. This makes it much more difficult to have indoor gatherings, which were apparently the biggest cause for the spike in cases. This is the best way to stop the activity that is supposedly the biggest spreading threat. 
Think about it. If you're not an essential worker, and you're not in your house from 8pm to 5am, you're probably: on your way to, on your way back from, or currently at an gathering. Which are already all illegal in the first place. 
The curcew sucks, but if you were following the rules already, your day to day life probably hasn't changedall that much..

C'est comme √ßa.
Le transport, c'est un peu plus vital que les starbucks. Les mesures, √ßa reste de la mitigation. Le but du couvre feu, c'est de donner une doucbe froide aux gens et de leur rappeler le s√©rieux de la chose parce qu'il y avait un sacr√© rel√¢chement. Moi je vois une grosse diff√©rence, le monde font beaucoup plus attention.
Thats how transit works... lol and how are you not allowed to open windows?
Public transit is not as risky as other closed space because is fully renewed every 10ish minutes or less because doors are often open. There is no accumulation of the virus overtime and people don't stay as long (in average) in public transport than they would in a restaurant. The duration of exposure is important. In general, they consider 15 minutes of close contact with someone infected to be at risk. In general public transit are not the problem for transmission and in particular because people wear masks. There is a risk but it is not the main one. It is not where the government will and should put their energy on. I don't have an article to link, but if you look on internet from reliable ressources such as MIT they will confirm it is not as risky as it appears.
if you dont like it, then you can geeet oout
i stopped reading when he said starbucks
That curfew was to reduce the amount of covidiots that meet other people in the evening. And it, without a doubt, works.
The negative it brings is prolly calculated and estimated by experts.
You cannot judge this whole situation just by pointing out one drawback.
By curiosity, you have any better idea of how to reduce evening meets?
> I cannot go into a Starbucks if there is THREE (3) people inside
you can't? Did they get stricter? Because end of November I went by one and it was *packed* with 6+ people not counting the employees and I noped the fuck away.
Looks like they're filming a movie in the area.

It seems like every time Hochelaga is mentioned in this sub there is a cohort ready to come to the defence of the neighborhood's reputation. The usual arguments are that it is not as bad as it used to be, it is rapidly gentrifying, and that there are worse areas in Montreal. All of those are true but it is also true that Hochelaga is still a shithole filled with poverty, crime, and drug use. I have friends who live there and I spend a lot of time there. The only reason people live in the schlag is because it is cheap. It is not a nice neighbourhood.
Sorry to hear about a tragedy so close to your home.  It sucks to feel unsafe.
Hochelaga was my favorite neighbourhood to live in during my time in montreal (between ndg, hochelaga, east plateau, and mile end).  I can't explain exactly why but i LOVED it there.
Force a toi :/  
J'entend souvent parler d'Hochelaga, le fait que ca craigne ... etc  
Mais au final, c'est grand Hochelaga, c'est dans quel coin de ce dernier que ce genre de choses arrive ?  
Pas partout quand m√™me ?
S√©rieusement, le quartier Hochelaga n'est pas l'endroit o√π il y a le plus de crime dans l'ann√©e.
Compare √† d'autre quartier comme Montr√©al-Nord, Ahuntsick,  NDG, Grinfintown, Saint-Henri, ou m√™me le centre-ville. Surtout, si tu entre le % de population dans l'√©quation, √ßa doit √™tre un des quartier le plus s√ªr de Montr√©al.
Pour se rajouter √† toutes les vidanges qui tra√Ænent partout sur les trottoirs du quartier. Je suis √† veille de me partir un blog avec des photos quotidiennes de toute la trash que je vois tra√Æner. Le monde sortent leurs vidanges 3 jours √† l'avance et le moindrement qu'un d√©chet n'est pas dans un sac noir, les √©boueurs l'ignorent. Hochelag..
c'est presque imperceptible vu toute la marde q'ya d√©j√† dans ste ruelle l√†.
Je trouve rien dans les journaux, plus d'info  ?
Is Hochelaga really that bad? I'm honestly not familiar. I live in Chicago. Montreal is just one of the cities I'm considering moving to in the future so that's why I joined this subreddit. I once talked to someone who lived near Hochelaga and he seemed to like it there.
I don't live in Montreal anymore, but when I did I worked night shifts near Cremazie metro station. One night I was listening to the radio while working and heard the news about a motorcycle having gone full speed into the FTQ bullding and died soon after.
When I finished my shift I went to the metro to go back home and when I approached the FTQ building I saw a huge black stain on a wall. When I approached it, nobody was there anymore but still there was literally a puddle of blood on the sidewalk. Was freak as hell.
C√¢lice! J'aimerais te demander pr√®s de quelle intersection, mais je ne veux pas que tu r√©v√®les o√π tu habites.
J'habite le m√™me quartier.
√áa s'est pass√© √† quelle heure?
Well I guess the new spin on ruelle vert is ruelle rouge in this case :(
Call the city to clean that shit up.  Disgusting and a child could touch it.
Do you know if it was a planned murder or just an innocent bystander?
That's horrible! Stay safe!!!
I would think they would have a cleaning crew after a murder
Lol you live in Hochelaga in 2020 it's not any more dangerous than le plateau this point
J‚Äôai habit√© pr√®s de l√† sur de Chambly entre Sherbrooke et Hochelaga. J‚Äôappelais √ßa ¬´¬†Upper-Hochelaga¬†¬ª. C‚Äô√©tait plus tranquille que quand j‚Äôai habit√© entre Adam et Ste-Catherine en tout cas...
This is why as a child who grew up in English machine I start having panic attacks to come to homa.
Like the first murder in Hochelaga in years lol stop complaining
I found Hochelaga to be the Verdun of the East. Until the city sold out and started making this place for the rich. I'm poor, so f*ck off please Valerie/Denis and Soraya.
OP sounds like a karma whore
What sector is this? In hochelaga
At least they didn't die of Covid.
I‚Äôm planning on going on an exchange travel to Montreal this year. Should I be worried? Is it that dangerous in that neighborhood? What‚Äôs the safest area in the city?
My old stomping ground!
delicious
C'est pour √ßa que je suis sorti de ce trou a rats pour un autre trou √† rats
How do you want them to remove the frozen tape, with a pickaxe ? The paper on the ground doesnt even seem related, you and your neighborhood should clean up your trash.
Shit happens. Move on.

I guess all that toxic waste has turned the squirrels into something fierce. Look out kids! This latest piece came at the request of u/HaggardHousewife, an NDG mother of three, who wanted to see her town home destroyed and "grotesque squirrels dragging her children away". Okay! I pulled out all the stops on this one, I feel. Inspirations for this piece range from Kent Monkman, The Simpsons, American Gothic, KC Greene's "This is Fine" dog, and others I'm sure. I love the carnage, the absolute Bedlam, the dynamic poses of the children, the visual density of the piece, everything. It's my new favorite. This took me nearly 40 hours of foam,¬†cardboard, craft paint, crayons, sharpies, hot glue and glitter, plus all the custom modelling work for 3d printing.  Some of the graffiti on this piece has a bit of international flair, at the request of the homeowner. She's a huge street art fan, so I included works from Banksy, Shepard Fairy, and Os Gemeos. Also included are wheat pastes from Lost.Claws, as well as my own tiny memorial to Tony Koulakis.
Right down to the shitty 'sake' tag, well done.
Post apocalyptic NDG look a lot like current NDG a day before the trash are collected.
Yooo i've been lurking around here seeing more and more of your posts, your work is absolutely stunning and makes me feel so proud be a montrealer. It's like you have this essence of nerdy badassitude in your work, and now, you're hitting me with a piece dedicated to the hood I've been calling home for most of my life!! So much attention to detail! I love the Cosmos memorial too (rip), damn damn damn...
I worked with someone once who I could see getting great value from your work. I will shoot you a DM!
One of my favourite things to do with your posts is find all the funny or great details. This one tops the cake! Love the skeleton just chillin' :p
i‚Ä¶ wow. this is beyond fucking coolio. congrats on being disgustingly talented!
SAKE !
I‚Äôve been seeing a few of your posts lately and I must say that your work is absolutely stunning. The details are insane!
And it would probably still be listed at $1.2 million, haha.
Amazing work!
I just rewatched one of my favourite childhood movies the other day, "Wallace and Gromit A Grand Day Out". The mice in the basement wearing the 3D glasses as the ship takes off is hilarious. Didn't know those mice made it to NDG !! :D
Is the apocalypse squirrel-based?
This has dethroned your Expo 67 as a personal favorite!
Thats just how it is now to me
@lost.claws ?
I'm loving your work man I recognize a lot of the scenery you base your work on. I would love to see an apocalyptic version of the Berri-UQAM area or the Place des Arts outdoor area.
Idk looks like a regular house in ndg
so funny to see my friends tags replicated on there
This is so cool. I love that you put SAKE on the side of the building loll
It reminds me of one of these old horror movies that were both gore and funny at the same time. It looks like this one could be called something like Apocalypse : Invasion of the mutant squirrels. I can picture it in my mind with the little rock funky music and the title in black and white. Awesome work, the details are really mesmerizing.
It‚Äôs amazing!  Love the farine five roses sign. 
I love the Instagram posts. Expected to see les foufounes √©l√©ctriques    
Super cool art concept.
Please tell me about Sake so I can appreciate an easter egg the artist added for the piece.
This is genius!
Yeah those squirrels is nasty on trash day.
Thanks dude! I used to live in NDG myself, Mish-Mash every Sunday, so I was really excited about this project.
Please do, I'm happy to talk about commissions. :)
I remember old episodes of The Simpsons where shots would pan up from below the ground and there was a bunch of stuff buried in the cross-section of earth. I wanted to try something like that for this piece.
Thanks, this one was a lot of fun!
Lol, the details are *because* I'm insane, probably. Thanks!
I mean, I assume that you've seen other properties in the neighborhood and you understand how competitively priced it is. :P Thanks!
Classic movie, I can only imagine how intense the set design must have been.
In this instance, yes! In a sense, I see us as being at an apocalyptic singularly, where any one factor could push us over the edge. Sometimes it's important to explore the serious aspects of that; wealth inequality, global warming, corporate governance, etc. Sometimes it's important to have fun, and imagine if mutant squirrels collapsed society.
My latest shit is my greatest shit, yo. Thanks!
On Instagram, yes.
Thanks! I've gotten a few requests for those locations. Right now I'm starting work on my next commission piece, then after that who knows?
Nothing to see here. :P
There's definitely a b-movie horror vibe going on. Thanks!

Walk around the city for a few hours, you'll see that the loser has tagged many things.
sake repeatetly tagged "covid is fake" around town in 2020 and posted wild dumb shit on his insta
We're lucky if it's just the squirrels
Looks great dude I think this is my fave one so far !!
I, for one, am looking forward to our squirrel overlords.
I'll be checking the gram to see!
Somebody ought to punch that guy in the face for architecture defacement. What a fucktard.
It's a pity that someone with such an extraordinary ability to get about was a chucklehead.
Same here!
Don't blame me, I voted Skippy/Deez Nuts 2020.
I see graffiti and tags as a barometer for civic disregard, that takes on it's own aesthetic once it reaches a critical mass.
"Chucklehead". Oh I like that.

So because I finish work at 7, means I get home at 7:30-45 and what, I can‚Äôt buy groceries? I can‚Äôt walk my dogs when I get home from work? You reopen high schools and think giving them 2 masks a day will help prevent the spread? Incompetence at its finest. Grosse blague notre gouvernement
During the winter I don't go out at night much, but this feels bad. Animal trapped in a shrinking cage kind of feeling. Closing down things is one thing, but having your freedom of movement restricted is on another level. 8 PM is very early as well.
Curfew doesn‚Äôt affect me much since I have been following guidelines because I want to get back to normal as fast as possible, but how will this exactly do anything if schools are open and there‚Äôs no severe lockdown? It seems like it‚Äôll just anger people even more, make people travel more than before, and just be plain counterproductive. 
Also at one point you can only take so much and Legault brought up how they care about mental health but they make it so difficult to find any sort of help that most people just give up, and it feels like they know that. Not only is it difficult to find therapy it‚Äôs also difficult to find it cheap because of waiting lists. i have people around me completely losing their minds and I don‚Äôt even know what to say anymore to make them feel better. 
Many ppl, including myself, are really starting to lose hope in our government and the people. It feels like it‚Äôs only a downwards spiral from here. It feels like this‚Äôll never end, and will continue in a vicious circle. Even the political drama happening to our neighbours down below is not helping people mentally at all. I guess you could call this a rant, it‚Äôs almost been a year and after losing my job due to covid and having a difficult time to find jobs, mental help, and basic entertainment to fulfil me, I feel like I‚Äôm slowly losing my sanity. 
Anyways, I hope everyone is well.
All this while primary and secondary schools being wide open. Master stroke! üëè
ITT: Angry night joggers
Lockdown seems a lot like the construction here...
#Absolutely ridiculous!!!
Restricting my solo, late night walks around my super quiet, empty neighborhood to clear my head for my mental health is not going to curb the spread of Covid19.
And now their big plan is to force everyone to pack into the grocery stores and go for walks after work before 8:00pm?!  The line-ups for groceries on the weekend are going to be crazy.
So what‚Äôs next when this doesn‚Äôt work?
If we look at the stats, the summer months (july-september) had the lowest case # and I believe that during this time, the shops and restaurants were open (even with consideration of the two week delay).
I‚Äôm no expert, but the hike in cases awefully coincides with the opening of schools (september+), thanksgiving and christmas.
Maybe instead of packing people into stores for a smaller time frame, try to actually crackdown on gatherings and close schools?
Fuck that. Schools ok but night jogs not? Reduced grocery hours? Profoundly idiotic shit, this
So I can't go outside, but can I run around the underground parking lot in my complex?
This government is a big fucking joke. C‚Äôest vraiment n‚Äôimporte quoi
[deleted]
I‚Äôm all for a strict curfew, but not closing down the majority of businesses and keeping schools open is literally helping nobody. 
All these half assed attempts is just making a very thing worse. 
Legault is not helping here
What about food delivery after 8?  What about taking dogs out for a walk after 8?
Because it is insane, it‚Äôs litteraly taking away your personal freedom.
This makes very little sense to keep schools open supposedly to keep the economics running but impose a curfew?
[deleted]
Any curfew is an extreme measure, justifiable in a democracy ONLY if a clear and demonstrable case can be made that it will have the predicted beneficial impact on the public good.
This is something we absolutely should not tolerate because of handwaves towards ‚Äúprivate gatherings‚Äù.  Show us the stats.
mental health? never heard of it. suicide? who cares. small business owners? fuck em.
-legault, presumably.
Confused. Curfew and electroshock, but schools remain open.
Also did I see something where legault said he expects all homeless people to be inside during curfew and that there‚Äôs ‚Äúenough room‚Äù? Like wtf.
I fully agree. The curfew is ridiculous and likely to make things worse at least on two aspects:
* Transmissions at supermarkets due to a compressed schedule that poorly fits many working people.
* Psychological suffering and even potentially suicides (The president of French urgentologist doctors said he observed an increase in suicides with the curfew in an interview with Radio-Canada)
And all that for what? To prevent evening meetings AFTER the holiday period is over? When we don't even know how big the problem is?
But what gets to me the most is that this government is doing NOTHING on its own to help with the crisis. They keep asking US to solve the problem with them. Let's be clear, these health guidelines, these lockdowns, these curfews, this isn't them doing anything, it's them asking US to deal with it ourselves, telling US what to do and blaming US when infections increase. We're paying the bill on EVERYTHING the government is "doing".
What about THEM?
What do THEY do to help?
Fuck all.
Do they attempt therapeutic treatments (ivermectin is being heavily promoted by many experts based on many prophylactic studies showing 70-90% reductions in cases when used preventively)? I'm not saying it's sure it works, but it's sure as hell worth a try, when they're willing to implement a curfew they even admit they have no evidence will even help!
No.
Do they use the millions of rapid tests they bought 4 months ago to initiate large-scale systematic testing to find early cases and prevent them from spreading?
No.
Do they organize large-scale systematic PCR testing of the population in heavily hit areas to try to find and treat cases early on?
No.
How about just recommending people take supplements that are KNOWN to boost the immune system like vitamin D and zinc? 95+% of people who get the virus get over it without the need for medical care, doesn't that mean that just giving an edge to one's immune system might help?
No.
They're not doing anything that requires that THEY do anything or take any professional risk at all. Anything that might give them responsibility for what happens, for successes or failures. They choose to exclusively do things that involves THEM telling US what to do, so that if cases go down, they can claim credit, and if cases go up... they can blame US. We're led by incompetent cowardice.
If they had attempted everything and nothing worked, and then said "a curfew's the only thing we haven't tried", that might be tolerable. But given the absolute lack of action from them on any initiative by the government to curb the epidemic, this is intolerable. This feels like just a punishment, even Arruda admitted he had NO evidence this would work. They're just experimenting on us, as long as we're the ones paying the price and that it requires no work and involves no personal or professional responsibility on their side, they don't seem to give a fuck.
Worst thing is, most people are just OK with that approach. I've literally had someone I've known all my life, closer than my cousins, block me on social media because I dared criticize the government and expressed my frustration with this measure.
This is an unacceptable breach of personal liberty so no good reason. Make it so that you can only walk alone, but not being able to go outside, there is no evidence behind this, all while keeping schools open. This is unacceptable.
Arruda qui dit qui a pas de grippe au Quebec actuellement , si vous avez des symptomes cest la covid ...
 LIKE WTF IS THAT ? How do you want us to trust you after saying bs like that ?
Does anyone know if the rules for people who live alone go back to only being able to receive one visitor and not to visit one family anymore? I couldn't find anywhere that was clear on this
So ‚Äúcases didn‚Äôt go down for three weeks when schools were closed‚Äù but also December is the busiest shopping season and every time I drove past the mall the parking lot was pretty much completely full just like any other year. Also there were ads this year actively asking people to shop in-store (looking at you, winners) which I thought was in poor taste.
Not to mention the curfew will disproportionately impact homeless people. After they raided and dispersed the campground on St Jacques the way they did I have a hard time believing they will be bringing them out to shelters... All the shit this city is going through is fucking sad. Then the ruling class still let foreign investors buy real estate here because ‚Äòit‚Äôs good for the economy‚Äô but who is the economy for if the cost of living outstrips the bottom 70% of wage earners? 
Excuse the rant. Like you, I am disturbed and annoyed by this news.
Legault and everyone around him need to resign as soon as we start seeing the light at the end of this tunnel. They‚Äôre incompetent, it‚Äôs done. All these optic-driven, poke in the dark tactics don‚Äôt work. Restrictions go up, and numbers go up more exponentially. Fuck this anecdotal ‚Äúpeople aren‚Äôt obeying the rules‚Äù shit. I‚Äôm sure a lot aren‚Äôt, but to feed into this feeds into their narrative of blame delegation. They don‚Äôt want you to ask the fundamental questions like how the fuck does our HC system collapse at 1300 hospitalizations and 200 ICUs when they had 8 months to prepare for the wave 2 they‚Äôve been warning us about? The system needs to be rebuilt from the ground up; and a new leadership needs to drive that.
Quel est l'explication scientifique entre un couvre feux et le fait de ralentir la propagation?
While I agreed and complied with the measures put in place, the curfew is over the limit for me. Legault says "by 8 pm people have to be in their houses" and brushes it off as being not so bad. If I lived in a house as big as Legault, I wouldn't mind the curfew at all. It's like if people living in small apartments in Montreal aren't his main voters and he doesn't care about them.
This kind of measure isn‚Äôt about actually impacting anything. It‚Äôs designed to distract the population, take their focus away from the decades of state incompetence that have left us completely unprepared for this pandemic.
They want you to focus on the small fraction of the population that breaks the rules, so you‚Äôll ignore the fact that them keeping schools open has had much more of an impact than anything we might do.
[deleted]
When the curfew that makes no sense sets in is when you start wondering if the conspiracies are true and our liberties are being intentionally eroded. The politicians can say "it's not me. it's the virus" and do whatever the hell they want (including vacationing, what they told us not to do btw).
When is the next protest
Curfew is too far... they‚Äôve crossed a line.
I just can't imagine this wont be challenged in court. They said it themselves, it's not meant to prevent the spread, it's just meant to scare people.
Not a big fan of this because it will just end up meaning people do things in mad dashes, put a downer on everyone, etc...  
But... When I look at my Instagram feed and see lots of people in QC having very active social lives (I mean literally showing parties/groups with different people every day) I fully understand why numbers are going up.  
I'll also mention that there are a lot of old people who have trouble understanding social distancing, wearing a mask correctly (or at all). These are the same people who absolutely need to go to their Provigo daily to buy their milk. The same people who will end up in hospital plugged in for 3 months and end up crashing the economy and lives of the majority of the population who follow the rules but now have even less to do because of a few selfish people.
I think what is happening is revolting. I‚Äôm all for taking safe precautions (using a mask, social distancing, limiting the amount of people in a store, and generally being safe). But to use the police as a means to suppress people‚Äôs personal freedoms at the expense of ‚Äúnational security‚Äù or ‚Äúemergencies‚Äù is egregious. Our rights are being trampled on and it is really taking a toll on people‚Äôs mental health. Suicide ideation has skyrocketed Over the last 3 months, depression and anxiety, substance abuse are steadily increasing. 
When are we, THE PEOPLE going to stand together and not allow for all of our freedoms to be taken away. The problem with the government controlling our mindsets is that they can extend these measures for literally however long they want under the guise of national security. This is just enabling government to overstep their boundaries. 
If sensible measures were taken to reduce the spread, schools would be closed also... I see people mentioning ‚Äúhave you ever seen how hard it is to have kids that aren‚Äôt in school (for the parents)‚Äù is not a good excuse to have schools open. We have seen time and time again that politicians make these rules but then fly all around the world because it‚Äôs RULES FOR THEE AND NOT FOR ME. 
As Benjamin franklin said ‚ÄúThose who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety‚Äù. 
Why can‚Äôt we be told the risks, and assess things for ourselves... this curfew is turning Canada into the communist party of China, or worse North Korea. This isn‚Äôt a joke anymore. And no I‚Äôm not out to kill your grandma, but keeping people inside forever is no longer the solution, the ramifications of these lockdowns will show in the next couple of years and will be decisively some of the worst decisions made in history. 
Thanks for coming to my TedTalk and let the downvotes begin.
What they are doing is inhumane... It's a crime against humanity... 
That said I'm a night time person too. I need to go outside. It's wrong to prevent people from getting into contact with nature. Also think about all the cops who will be outside in the name is protecting the peace... pisses me off.
A lire toute les commentaires..j"ai fait mon deuil lorsqu'ils ont ferm√© les gyms...ca faisait aucun sens puisque le gouv gardaient les gym d'escalade ouvert...Donc, j'ai d√©j√† p√©t√© ma coche il y a quelques mois pour cette injustice et accept√© que le gym reviendrait cet √©t√©.

The curfew is insane. I have no idea how it‚Äôs supposed to do anything to combat the spread of covid, but it‚Äôs a serious blow to mental health and just general QOL
Data has already shown us that 19,279 cases have been directly linked to students and staff from 2,341 schools across the province since the onset of the pandemic. We do not have adequate ventilation in our schools. We determined this with air quality tests. 
Students under 5th grade still don't have to wear masks in class. Children are often asymptomatic spreaders of the virus. They need to close the schools if they can't manage them during the pandemic. Not doing so is counterproductive to curbing the spread. The kids will still spread it amongst themselves and school staff, and they can all potentially spread it to their family members at home. 
Legault also said he expects the homeless to abide by the curfew while our shelters are chronically under stress, and stretched even more thin due to COVID spreading within the homeless population but where is the aid for these people and shelters? We just cram them in at max capacity? Legault said this curfew is about saving lives. I kinda feel like he's pissing on our leg.

Visiting from the Toronto subreddit, I feel for you guys over this complete BS. I hope all the people in the Toronto sub who are constantly complaining about how ‚ÄúiTs nOt a rEaL lOckDoWn1!1!‚Äù would react to news like this. 
Because we all know the virus doesn‚Äôt transmit at night.
Didn't Legault say something to the effect of: "if you really need to walk after 8pm, you can walk, just know that we are asking everyone to stay home"  
I'm not fluent in French so I may have misunderstood. But I thought he was implying that it's not recommended but you won't be in trouble for a late night walk.
And to think all we needed to do to avoid this was use the last 8 months of prep time to develop a functional healthcare system.
Stupid all the way around. Theres no logical argument for this. I used to like Legault. Fuck this piece of shit now. I cant believe this is a thing lol what the fuck
It's clear decisions are being made for economic reasons and not health reasons. You can't just keep tightening every bolt and hope it fixes the leaky one. 
I can only lock down so hard. My wife and I work from home, we don't see anybody unless it's a walk outside when the weather is -5 or better because we have a newborn and it's hard to take her out. So what are we supposed to do, see nobody *extra* hard?
Article 13, subsection 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights goes as follows,
‚ÄúEveryone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state.‚Äù Therefore that curfew is a violation of human rights and should be abolished immediately.
The measure if obviously to discourage people from congregating or visiting others late in the day. Will it be affective? Who knows but we know for sure but many people will follow these instructions so less people around the better it is. We will never really contain this with these half-assed measures... oh yeah schools are opening as predicted so what's the point?
We have a peaceful protest on the very first day of this curfew at 8pm? Everyone sits/stands outside in front of the homes on their property, with a mask and distancing from others.
That's no moon...

Great pictures!
Illuminer le pont √©tait une des pires id√©es de Coderre. gaspillage de fond publique et d‚Äô√©lectricit√© quotidienne. et c‚Äôest laid.
EDIT: Bon clairement personne n'Est daccord avec moi.
Mais on peut pas se cacher queca co√ªte extr√™mement ch√®re d'√©lectricit√© ... Dans la pand√©mie, ca aurait pu √™tre ferm√© toute l'ann√©e...

I love our lightbrite bridge
√áa fait 300x que je passe sur le pont depuis et je le trouve toujours aussi magnifique
L'id√©e venait de Richard Bergeron, pas de Coderre. Pis c'est le gouvernement f√©d√©ral qui a pay√© pour. La consommation d'√©nergie est insignifiante. La consommation d'√©lectricit√© annuelle est l'√©quivalent d'une douzaine de maisons.
Ouin jetais pissed au moment que ca arrivait... but god damn it grew on me!
C'est d'une beaut√© qui me remplit de fiert√©. Pis gaspillage d'√©lectricit√©, s√©rieux?
Pour moi, cy surtout que √ßa l√©gitimise la pollution lumineuse excessive de Montr√©al.
Au contraire, c'est vraiment beau.

Really clears the mind before bed.
Good morning everyone . ‚òï
Always appreciated the bit of green in any photos.

beautiful view.
I love it! When I would travel to Montreal in June, I always made sure there was one night when I stayed up to see morning twilight before going to sleep.
beautiful... was it at 5am sharp or minutes ago (I am looking for accurate time please)? thanks
Montreal is my favorite city; I can't wait to go back once the border reopen.
Wow I thought everything at the bottom of the picture was water on a roof reflecting the city, with the handrail as the edge of the roof.
Just beautiful! :)
Our city has it's problems  and fats,but it is still a wonderful place !
That's the back of St. Patrick's bottom left. Regardless, beautiful photo. Miss Montreal so much.
What is there to enjoy?

Just don't look behind the camera. It's a construction site where the homeless go to piss. 
Nice shot though. üíì
Shouldn't this be on other cities reddits instead
This one isn‚Äôt
[removed]
Correct. This is at the Mount Royal metro station, so not really a street but a sidewalk. The concrete and fencing on the right side blocks off the construction area.
Plot twist: the photographer is actually a construction worker who surveils for the construction will be started next week.
M√©tro Mont-Royal
It's metro Mont Royal. It's been under construction for years. To the left of the pic is also Mont Royal and St Denis where there is a big homeless problem , specifically for first Nation people. It's a nice picture but moving the lens in any other direction would show you a troubled ( but safe ) neighbourhood. 
I'm being genuine, when I say its a nice shot though :)

If that was true, then Canada wouldn‚Äôt have rigged the referendum for Quebec to stay. Food for thought.

In the graffiti slang, this is called a Heaven Spot, a hard-to-reach and dangerous location to make a tag (if you fall, "you go to heaven", hence the name).
Graphiti artist, yes.  But there is nothing artistic about tags IMO.
*Grabs popcorn while the "I pay my taxes!" crowd and the artsy crowd hiss at each other*
Can someone explain the purpose of a tag? Is it like claiming territory of what's the point?
Tant qu‚Äô√† faire un tag aussi laid aussi bien dessiner des graines. 
Shoutout pour le spot though
I'm not.
"Artists"
No offense i think thats a street gang tag, i wouldn't call him an "artist"
Go onyx! Po-k√©-MON!
You mean vandals. Tags are nothing more than an eyesore. I wish the law was more strict on people who paint these abominations
Sp√©cialement quand ils sont laid. Risking your life for.. this?
Why are so many people in this city such fucking squares lmao
Slightly impressed.
But very, very annoyed.
Making a nice mural, conceptualizing something incredible and carrying it out, that's **art**.
Drawing the same filthy tag everywhere within sight, on bridges, overpasses, signs, trucks, trains, that's just vandalism.
Same here! I'm kinda new to the city and every time I see graffiti in unusual places, it always fascinates me.
ONYX is the fucking worst.

[deleted]
I'm not impressed. I find it's stupid, Self righteous, and makes my city look like shit.
That‚Äôs not art. They‚Äôre not artists.
I remember when the Galipeault bridge used to have that big red suspension tower. Had to be a hundred feet high, but every year the graduating class of Mac High would go up and tag it. That‚Äôs dedication.
I love graffiti. I hate tags. They are not art.
I love the finish on the photo. Is it through an app?
check out 1UP for some great graffiti art
I think it's appalling. It makes the city look run-down, it is crass. There is no art in this, just sheer wanton vandalism.
This is where Cote St Antoine cross over autoroute Decarie! I walk past this everyday. I remember when the "onyx" popped up.
For all the effort put into climbing up there, I wish the tags were more skilled. I've seen some wicked clever tags in Monkland.
It's less impressive when they get hit by trains in the railyard.
I love tags, give humanity to the bland capitalism architecture.
Posting to say I moved here in 2018 and ZoneK are the most prolific taggers I have ever seen and I have lived in 8 major cities in NA.
These people need to be found and forced to clean all the fuckin mess they made all over the city. The more tagging the longer it takes.
Onyx Vs Kong
"graffiti art"
are you kidding, this is nothing... look for street graffiti (picha√ß√£o) in south america and you'll learn from the best
Wow that's insane!
Onyx lurks
I remember back in the day all the graffiti said VC I don‚Äôt see those anymore
That's how i got my username for videogames "onyx"
Would be impressed if they actually threw up a decent tag.
Pretty sure the type of person that goes around tagging everything with a low-effort tag is the same type of person that blasts music from their phone on the Metro.
Damn that's wild!
I'm always surprised when these post come up how many people are apologists for this sort of blatant vandalism. 
Just because it's part of a culture doesn't mean it's good or needs to be preserved. There are endless great things about graffiti or hip-hop culture that could be focused on instead. 
To defend defacing the infrastructure that we all rely on and pay for for the sake of "the culture" is like saying drug dealing and human trafficking should be preserved because they are essential to rap music. Whatever.
That's not a graffiti artist. That's just a tag.

so many pussies in this thread lol ‚ÄútHaTs VaNdAlIsM!‚Äù 
The city would look better if they just let it get covered in graffiti instead of having them painted over which just means the taggers are gonna hit it again. 
Know whats uglier than graffiti? A wall that was bombed and tagged getting painted over by the city but you can still faintly see the graffiti under it. Thats ugly as fuck. Just let it be.
yea that's the idea

Even rarer, a boarded-up caboose
It looks like hell too.  As a kid, I used to rush outside when a freight train would pass because there was always a dude waving at the kids from the caboose
> caboose
80% of Montreal's infrastructure is from the 1960s
They're not that rare actually, but you don't see them on mainline trains going between cities. Nowadays they're used on local trains that serve industries, they'll sometimes put a caboose, now referred to as a riding platform at the end so that the conductor doesn't have to grip the side ladder of a car while shoving long distances.
J'ai travaill√© sur le site du vieux port et une bonne partie de la job √©tait de dire √† du monde de d√©caiss√© de sur les rails quand un train arrivait!
On pouvait avoir jusqu'√† 10 passages de trains par jours
Better than the mother who was pushing a stroller over a stopped train. 
I'm surprised more people dont die there.
A few years back a woman got both her legs cut off because she tried to go across a parked train on these tracks. The train started moving while she was still wiggling her way through.
Nice pic. Saw this one in the yard the other day and couldn't help but wonder how old it is
Or they could take the CP tracks and not have an active train line in a tourist area.

There's the same thing around the Atwater Market - tracks that lead to Robin Hood silos that people think are vestigial.
but its like a tourist attraction? see many tourists take selfies or whatever on the track esp. when trains are crossing

Ottawa et Montr√©al c'est pas du tout le m√™me calibre. Ottawa n'a jamais √©t√© une ville industrielle.

Don't feel bad about how you responded to late night catcalling. We are human and we have varied emotion responses to how we get approached by strangers and most are valid and normal.
I am glad you are safe and you called the police, you did the right thing.
J'esp√®re que le reste de ta semaine ira mieux, and I hope in general you'll be alright. Thanks for letting us know, that's very good of you as well.
What the fuck kind of explosives do people just throw in the streets?

In all seriousness though, very glad you are okay.
Downtown has been shitty these days. 3 stabbings in less than a months on Ste catherine, one of them literally in front of my building on Maisonneuve and St Mathieu. Hopefully this wave of craziness dies out.
You made no mistake being snarkily.  Standing up for yourself is never a mistake.  I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you.
My school is near there and I had a scary encounter with a begger back in December and I wasn‚Äôt the only student at my school who reported an incident. Luckily I was with a friend so I wasn‚Äôt alone. 
With the pandemic and working from home, there are a lot less people downtown so beggars arent getting as much money and are more agressive. 
Good to know you‚Äôre okay, stay safe.
The vast majority of you have been lovely with your advice and well wishes and I am so grateful for that thank you! Many women have also shared similar experiences which I am sorry to hear about and i hope all of you made it out safely.
But man a few of these comments are just so insensitive and display a frightening lack of empathy and class. I can't imagine reading a post like this and having the things that those few people have commenting being the only thing to cross my mind lol.
I always thought Downtown Montr√©al was a scary place for women, especially at night. I hope you‚Äôre okay.
An explosive??
I‚Äôm so sorry you experienced this. I hope you don‚Äôt encounter him again. 
I sometimes yell back too, as women it‚Äôs tiring to experience demeaning behavior from creepy men most of our lives.
A few months ago I had an intense confrontation with two fat rednecks on a sidewalk whilst carrying heavy grocery bags. They started berating me for waring a mask and tried forcing me off the sidewalk. I screamed loudly which deterred them.
The pandemic has had very negative effects on those already suffering mental illness. I used to feel safe in this city at night and I no longer do.
Everyone should be careful when walking alone at night. Walk with confidence, keep your head up, be aware of your surroundings, think about your footwear. When every second counts, the police is minutes away.
Je suis vraiment d√©sol√©e que tu aies eu √† vivre ca! 
Je travaille dans ce coin de la ville depuis des ann√©es, et j'ai travaill√© durant tout le temps de la pand√©mie. En mars/avril 2020, j'ai r√©alis√© √† quel point il y a des itin√©rants dans Montr√©al et qu'ils auraient grand besoin, en tr√®s grosse majorit√©, de soins de sant√© mentale! Avant, avec la foule des √©tudiants et travailleurs dans les tours de bureaux, ils se fondaient dans la masse. Mais depuis que le centre-ville est vide, il ne reste qu'eux et quelques travailleurs essentiels. On ne peut pas ne pas les voir! Et la crise n'aide en rien, ils sont probablement plus stress√©s de tout ca eux aussi. Beaucoup de refuges et autre aides pour eux ont ferm√©s ou ont √©t√© r√©duits. Je marche beaucoup dans le centre-ville, et certains matins, j'√©tais seule de "normale", je ne croisais que des itin√©rants louches. M√™me √† 7h30 le matin, ce n'est pas plus s√©curitaire. Il ne m'est toutefois jamais rien arriv√© de bien f√¢cheux. Le pire qui me soit arriv√©, c'est une "similation" de me faire poignarder dans le dos (juste avec le point, pas de couteau, fort heureusement, mais ce fut la peur de ma vie pendant quelques secondes, on s'entend!). 
C'est inqui√©tant pour nous, mais aussi pour eux, et c'est immens√©ment triste. Ils n'ont pas une tr√®s belle qualit√© de vie non plus. Et ils n'en sont pas responsable √† 100%.

Glad you‚Äôre safe! What part of downtown was this? Atwater? McGill? Thanks for sharing, and you‚Äôre right that it‚Äôs best to ignore strangers
Ah yes I remember him. Was he wearing some funky clothes ? Like Pink pants with purple shirt? 
If that‚Äôs him, I remember him yelling and insulting at me for not giving him money. For sure he‚Äôs not a normal person
This is to all men:
If you feel the urge to post anything belittling such actions or poking fun at how women are fed up with male disrespect then you are part of the problem.
If you are a man posting to scold the small minded male behaviour that is a nuisance to our mothers and sister and daughters then please speak out loud for the others to hear you.
It‚Äôs the men who will stop the abuse and violence in our streets and homes because it‚Äôs the men who cause it.
Jesus sorry that happened to you. And you should NOT fucking have to explain yourself for being freaked out by it. But since Reddit is dominated by young men with little understanding of the female experience, as well  as incels, it's unsurprising unfortunately. 
Thanks for the warning!
What kind of fucking psychopath is that guy? People in the comments victim shaming aren't any better too.
"aggressive guy catcall me and wasn't in the mood to take anyone's shit today so I responded snarkily. I realise this is a mistake"  
This isn't a mistake. Men like that need to be called out for their shitty behaviour.
Thank you for sharing this with everyone ! You're amazing and your effort and bravery much appreciated !
Around which cross street/area of st cats? Saw a sketch guy earlier in the day around elexis nihon that fits that profile. Did you notice a satchel on them?
Wow. Je pr√©sume que les gens qui commentent "c'EsT jUsTe Un P√©TaRd" auraient une attitude diff√©rente si c'√©tait √† eux que c'√©tait arriv√©...
R√®gle g√©n√©rale, dans la vraie vie, contrairement aux films hollywoodiens, les explosifs et les armes √† feu font des bruits tr√®s similaires √† celui d'un p√©tard. √áa peut √™tre tr√®s difficile faire la diff√©rence entre un p√©tard inoffensif et quelque chose de potentiellement mortel. Il faut donc toujours rester prudent.
Dommage que rien d'autre puisse √™tre fait pour l'instant; √ßa me semble en effet le genre de m√©saventure qui peut arriver √† presque n'importe qui, plus particuli√®rement aux femmes d√ª √† la perception qu'elles sont plus faciles √† victimiser. Une l√©g√®re erreur de jugement dans des circonstances difficiles ne m√©rite aucunement de vivre une exp√©rience aussi √©prouvante et j'esp√®re que le coupable sera appr√©hend√© avant qu'il ne commette l'irr√©parable.
Hang in there, OP.
This is fucking ridiculous! No one should be made to feel unsafe and belittled like that! You did the right thing by standing up for yourself. You shouldn‚Äôt need to do that just for being yourself. I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through that OP.
None of this was your fault OP. Fuck all those morons who think otherwise
SPVM being useless again. Sorry that happened and glad you‚Äôre safe
That's fucking crazy. He threw a firework at you and the cops can't do anything? It's an act of violence.
Lol @ the police. No wonder women are scared, he threw an explosive at you and they‚Äôre just like *‚Äùwe can‚Äôt do anythingggg‚Äú* for fucks sake.
Literally just got home from verbal assault on Milton. This is honestly ridiculous and a saddening topic from all sides.
I wish you had video of him.
Thanks for the heads up and glad you‚Äôre ok! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Guy here. 
Wish everyone's reaction witnessing this situation would be to call the cops immediately.
No one should feel scared to walk down the street.
And I think you reacted good. Unless you are ready for physical interactions with agressive people, ignoring is the best way to go.
I just moved to an apartment a couple blocks from ste cath and whenever I walk through downtown it‚Äôs honestly scary how often men try to hit on me or catcall me. Yesterday it happened 3 times in a 20 minute span, with one of the men following me for a couple blocks until two girls came up to me and asked if I was ok (thank goodness for them). 
I‚Äôm typically a friendly person (who is used to more small town chatting) so when someone approaches me on the street and says hello, I always respond, thinking maybe they need directions of something. And then I regret it when their eyes start scanning up and down my body. Ugh. 
Really sorry you went through this, I can‚Äôt even imagine what I would do if someone threw an explosive. Hope you‚Äôre doing okay.
I work directly in front of that church and have been approached before. Last week, I was approached by a taller British guy, who was pressuring me to follow his Instagram and go to his house. He was super annoying.
However, the funniest thing that happened is that I was vaping when he approached me, and he said "excuse me, what's the closest vape store to here? Gotta make that cloud, you know... hit that nic"
*and at that moment, I knew, this man had never vaped in his life.*
Anyway, there are a ton of creeps around there. I do fear leaving work late, so I always try to leave while it's light out. I live in this area as well and always walk with my keys in between my fingers in case I need to fend off someone.
Some men in this comment section are disgusting. This is our reality. I fear for my safety every single time I leave my house. I scan the road for men like I scan the road for deer when I am driving in the country, check behind my shoulder often, and text my partner if I am out. I have an emergency call system set up by clicking my phone's power button 5 times. I live with my door locked always, and will not leave at dark without someone else.
This is reality.
What a piece of shit. I'm glad you're alright. My wife always has bear spray. It's technically legal and it will definitely get you out of a bind like that.
I dont know in wich area of st-Cath you were, but for a quick intervention, there's a police station between Bishop and Mackay in front of a church (near concordia)
Which part of the city ?
Why were you not pursuing charges? The police can go get security footage and serve some justice. They probably know him, once they see his picture.
Check here to see if the city could have captured it, else lots of private cameras outside businesses.

How the fuck did he get explosives? Pardon my language.
I'm glad you're OK!
[removed]
If we don‚Äôt do anything, street thugs like this one will eventually plaque the city, just like what Australia is enduring a rat plaque. Drug addicts deserve no humanitarianism, because once they chose drugs, you gave up dignity and humanity.
Im no advocate for violence but...
Im getting downvoted for hinting that women should carry pepper spray or smtg like that. Ok lol
Oh, the scary Black man...
Lol threw an explosive...just like in gaza
[removed]
Moral of the story: Downtown is a cesspool, and the sky is blue. 
I don‚Äôt go downtown for that exact reason. Too many sketchy bums and hooligans.
Hyst√©rie ou hyst√©rique?
Love your username, it's a great piece!
Man I remember downtown in the late 90‚Äôs. A woman‚Äôs runs up to us saying some creeps following and harassing her, he gets stomped out for good measure, problem solved. Even the cops wouldn‚Äôt care who beat the creep as he deserved it.
Today, no one will do anything about it because if you touch him you‚Äôll get brought up on charges for assault and it‚Äôll be much worst for you than for the creep. 
It‚Äôs a sad state of affairs montreal.

Quelqu'un peut nous traduire le po√®me svp?
It's an ancient poem about a City near Shanghai called Suzhou which I have once personally visited. Known as the Chinese Venice, you find there networks of water ways and gondolas.
Legend has it that there was a custom of ringing of a bell (of the Hanshan Temple) in the middle of the night (during Tang dynasty 618 to 907) . this is said to have caused melancholia & sadness for those who heard it.
And there is a very interesting twist for us in the west. Hansan the poet, was an important figure to Jack Kerouac.
The temple bares his name; Hanshan  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanshan\_(poet)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanshan_(poet))

The boat is resting at night. The clear view at night and the sound of bells make the author feel very lonely and homesick.](https://cn.hujiang.com/new/p471934/)

This should be standard everywhere
Imagine whole outdoor pavillions for a class.
This is a 10000$/year school with chirurgical grade air purifier in every classroom, purifiers mostly financed by the rich parents of the students. They did a really successful fundraising at the beginning of the school year.  
These outdoor classrooms are just ¬´¬†la cerise sur le sunday¬†¬ª

Distance the logs will help ,running nose from kids.
This is an interesting approach. I would have really enjoyed this as a kid!
Why are the lower logs behind the higher ones? Nice idea but not well thought out.
Too little too late
Have you not heard? Wood is for the rich now. It must cost a fortune!
I hope you're joking üòÇ... On the contrary you need access to _more_ resources to set that up!
I grew up in India and I had outdoor classes in the sun during winters.
Those were always some fun classes.

Parceque ils ne sont pas utilis√© en ce momment.
Those stumps could be moved
Great movie.
Thanks for reminding me about that awful movie. Why hasn't anyone done a true-to-story version lately? I would love to see this done properly with today's special effects.
It's better than in a class, anyway you look at it. Outdoors is way, way more healthy than in a class, especially if you're worried about airborne particles.
The taller logs were the 'desks' and the small ones, the 'seats'. They were bolted to each other.
Nice comment, but not well thought out.
[deleted]
They set those up back in the fall.
Not sure why your comment is getting downvoted; the schools should have been closed for a long time now & the desperate clawing at resources & excuses to get them back open is pitiful and par for Legault's shite administration.
This is a really expensive private school with chirurgical grade air purifiers in every classroom. The outdoor classroom are just for fun.
Seriously! I read people sell 2 foot sectional of log for 50-100$!
Got nothing on Italy, where they do it on the beach.
Pas exatement. Les √©l√®ves du primaire sont divis√©s par les <<bulles-classes.>>

MegaBrain here is right
I would pitch it, as these scenes from the original were cool, like the monsters humans hunting the cattle. that's a cool scene, the transitions in time cool, Orlando jones as a hologram of all human knowledge well selling the 7 UP YOURS add campaign, and still being my fave regular on MADtv.  get the writing, directors, and dop from the new mortal combat and start with movie one in the can't stop the death scene with more creative ways to die where she like puts radium on her face to look more white, and drops dead from radiation poisoning, she get's jacked the rippered.  
you know a little darker and visually stunning.  same as the first MK vs the 2021 MK
 with the movie ending at the end of the 20th-century people dying out because of space X vs bezos blue moon coloeny base blowing the moon up and causing the end of that time, then having a going going going like a last at sea vibe for the open of movie two, plus a long cut off jupiter base, and mars base...  
moving to movie three picking up on him meeting the new peoples, and cooler mutated new human hybrids refusing to fight for dominance against the past ones and the new ones being future people fourth-most in brain dev there the brain stem becomes far more dense and physical strength going huge and no real story of where they could go or could do, and they learn old legends and updated stories from the before fore time. and end of the third one they are start looking like the kids in the first matrix movie literally  teaching some of the fighting last jump learn, the new people are guardian types maybe of the galaxy ... as Disney owns the rights I think, unless they let it expire. and then a merge in tv series adding them to the marvel universe...
But why introduce something worse as an argument in favour of something BAD?  Just space out the seats ffs.
Ahhhh, I see. I guess there's another row of smaller ones hidden. Thanks.
How so?
Schools should have been closed.
I wasn't aware. I thought we were in May by now.
Meh
Yep. They weren‚Äôt even checking the kids temperatures before they were allowed in the school. And parents like myself who chose to homeschool due to the pandemic were ostracized and given zero resources.
It's the √âcole Buissonni√®re... So you're right, a private school - but not that overly expensive especially if you look at tax breaks in Quebec and Canada. In line with most private schools (LCC is, as an example, a _really_ expensive private school). 
The building looks old, but I don't know if there is a chirurgical grade air purifiers or not. You may be right and they may have those equipment. But still, purifiers or not, outdoors are way better than in a class if you're worried about airborne particles.
I guess only the rich get clean air.
>who chose to homeschool due to the pandemic were ostracized and given zero resources
j'esp√®re que tu me niaises, il ont cr√©√© une panoplies de ressources √©ducatives disponibles pour tous avant m√™me la fin de l'ann√©e scolaire 2019-2020 pour aider l'√©ducation √† la maison. Je te dirais que tu dois avoir acc√®s √† 90% des ressources qu'on a √† l'√©cole!
Maybe you're right. A couple of websites?? I'm talking about ability to socialize. For example, they could have at least paired up students whose parents decided to homeschool so they could have socialization. When I told the school I was homeschooling they said "good luck, you're on your own then". I was literally ostracized.
> I'm talking about ability to socialize. For example, they could have at least paired up students whose parents decided to homeschool so they could have socialization.
qu'est ce qui t'emp√™che de faire √ßa toi m√™me? √áa se fait tr√®s facilement par zoom/teams. Tu penses qu'on fait quoi avec les √©l√®ves le jour sur deux qu'ils ne sont pas en pr√©sentiel? Tu as d√©cid√© de faire l'√©cole √† la maison au lieu de faire l'√©cole en pr√©sentiel ou l'√©cole virtuelle, tu t'attendais √† quoi pour la socialisation!
> I was literally ostracized 
se faire dire: bonne chance, on n'a rien de plus √† te donn√© que ce qui est fourni ne veut pas dire ostracis√©... 
J'ai l'impression que tu penses qu'on a des milliers de ressources en √©cole et qu'on les garde juste pour ne pas t'en donner!
I‚Äôm on a Facebook group for Quebec homeschoolers but nobody really lives in the same neighborhood and it‚Äôs not that easy to be in someone‚Äôs bubble during Covid. If the schools paired up kids I‚Äôd have someone local my kid could learn with.
>nobody really lives in the same neighborhood
Dans le commentaire pr√©c√©dent je te parle de faire √ßa en virtuel, comme on le fait √† l'√©cole.
>If the schools paired up kids
Donc tu quittes le syst√®me mais tu t'attends √† ce que l'√©cole fasse la besogne pour toi?
Cute rink and cute Charlie Brown Christmas tree.

Oh my gosh. This is adorable
Quand j'√©tais plus jeune, je me souvient que j'avais demand√© √† ma m√®re pourquoi elle achetait des trucs du dollarama pour mes petits cousins (ils avaient 8 ans dans le temps). Elle m'a r√©pondu que pour moi c'est des cadeaux *lame*, mais pour eux √ßa sera le monde!

T'es au courant que la glace et la neige fondent √† la fin de chaque hiver right?
The size of the rink is about 40cm x 2m, and the banks are lower than the snow in front of my house.
C'est une photo de la murale de Leonard Cohen!
They won't see it. Look icy as any mtl sidewalk ahah.
Also, they don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs too small and they can‚Äôt make money on it
Il manque juste un peu de cr√©ole, d'arabe et d'espagnol.
I certainly am...but purposely piling an extra 1000 lbs of frozen water right in front of where the foundation meets the flat surface isn't the most brilliant of ideas. And as the outer bank is much higher than the ice, which direction do you think the runoff will gi?
Like I said, I like the idea. But anybody with any knowledge in the industry knows that water is not your friend. It finds the lowest point and path of least resistance. I have no dog in this fight so I hope it all works out for everybody.
Depuis le belv√©daire !
>extra 1000 lbs of frozen water right
T'as pas regard√© la m√™me photo que nous on dirait, ya pas vraiment plus de glace qu'apr√®s une bonne passe classique de verglas.
So you think the ice plus the compacted embankment weigh significantly less?
You're the type of neighbour to demolish someone's snowman because it ruins your view, lmao.

Let's revist this giant leap to conclusions so you can explain the mental gymnastics you used.
I originally responded, "I like the idea, but if we get a quick melt the basement occupiers might get a surprize", to which you responded:
>You're the type of neighbour to demolish someone's snowman because it ruins your view, lmao.
>Fucking cartoon villain type.
Give it a shot, braniac.
You're the tyoe of redditor to jump into a conversation without having read my original response to OP because you think it's funny.
Fucking clown type.
I'm not talking about the supporting capacity of the building...remember I mentioned the foundation meeting the ground? You obviously have no understand of what I'm talking about.
I read the entire interaction, just decided to reply to the first comment because it wasn't adding to the other thread specifically.
Cheers scrooge.
Non, c'est toi qui comprend crissement rien.
I've had too much internet today I guess. I'm going outside to shake my fist at the clouds and take note of who puts their recycling bin out before 9:00 p.m. Mrs O'malley the 96 year old widow next door gets her grandson to put it out when he leaves after their weekly dinner, which is about 5:30. I told the city and even have proof.
Use your adult words. You're just showing your immaturity and lack of knowledge on a subject way too complex to grasp.

One thing that's terribly inefficient is your ad blocker.
Toutes ces publicit√©s de Coderre partout font que je me questionne r√©ellement sur le financement de son parti. En effet, avant le d√©but de la campagne, il y avait des articles de journaux qui faisaient √©tat des centaines de milliers de dollars de dette que tra√Æne Ensemble Montr√©al comparativement au tr√©sor de guerre de pr√®s d‚Äôun demi-million de PM. Pourtant on voit des pubs de Coderre dans tous les journaux, les r√©seaux sociaux et autres supports. D‚Äôo√π vient tout l‚Äôargent pour mener une campagne de publicit√© de ce genre qui co√ªte tr√®s cher. Deux choses l‚Äôune, soit PM utilise vraiment mal chaque dollar ou bien Coderre a une source intarissable d‚Äôargent. Pourtant les dons sont plafonn√©s √† 200$ par personne en ann√©e √©lectorale‚Ä¶ 
Ajout: article sur le financement des partis: Je vous recommande cet article de La Presse : Dette de 424¬†000¬†$ pour Ensemble Montr√©al https://lp.ca/d0eEPb?sharing=true
venant du gars qui chiale qu'on s'attarde trop √† sa personnalit√© iiih boy
Le smog affecte la m√©moire des Montr√©alais, √ßa a l'air... revoter pour Coderre.... ciboire.......
J'ai donn√© un surnom √† Denis Coderre: "Business"
Parce que c'est la seule chose qu'il a en t√™te: faire des affaires avec des entrepreneurs multimillionnaires pour faire fleurir leur business dans Montr√©al, au d√©triment des r√©sident, de leur qualit√© de vie, de l'image et du patrimoine de la ville.
Il s'en fout que le Mont-Royal soit cach√© par des grandes tours de condo de luxe au centre-ville. Il s'en fout que lesdites grandes tours ne vont aucunement contribuer √† la densification de la ville puisqu'elles seront majoritairement des tours d'habitation de luxe √† usage presque unique d'investissements et ne seront pas habit√©s. Et il se fout que tout ce que √ßa va faire est contribuer √† l'augmentation du prix de l'immobilier. Car, c'est bon pour la "business".
Il se fout aussi qu'un terrain √† proximit√© de r√©sidences, qui aurait pu avoir une vocation de parc naturel dans un quartier populaire, soit transform√© en grande cour √† container avec des gros camions qui vont y circuler jour et nuit et qui vont empester le quartier, faire de la poussi√®re et une tonne de bruit pour tous les r√©sidents autours, car c'est bon pour la "business".
Il s'en fout qu'un stade de sport au complet soit construit aux frais des contribuables au profit d'un riche promoteur d'√©quipe sportive, qui aurait pu se le payer lui-m√™me, car c'est bon pour la "business".
Il veut encourager la venue d'encore plus de gros √©v√®nements organis√©s, encore par de riches promoteurs et entreprises, au d√©triment d'activit√©s de quartiers qui peuvent stimuler l'√©conomie chez des petits commer√ßants, parce qu'il veut mettre Montr√©al "sua map", car c'est bon pour la "business."
Il s'en contre-calice de la densification des quartiers comme Rosemont, Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Verdun, La Petite Bourgogne, Saint-Henri, Pointe-Saint-Charles, le village, le Plateau Mont-Royal o√π il y a plein de vieux immeubles en d√©cr√©pitudes qui pourraient √™tre transform√©s en blocs d'habitation modernis√©s de 4 √† 6 √©tages et qui pourraient aider √† densifier la ville pour de vrai. Ou que de tr√®s grands espaces pourraient √™tre convertis en parc pour donner la chance aux habitants de la pleb d'aller se reposer un peu et faire des activit√©s de plein-air. Parce qu'en v√©rit√© il n'en a rien √† fouttre.
I hated him before, but now that he's trying to look like austin powers I hate him derisively.

lol, that's terrifying. 
It might be actually be a mistake, but "page takeover" ads are actually a thing. They're meant to do exactly what they did in this instance, make you notice the ad because it stands out so much.
Trying to convince people of what he's not.
Ya un faux sourire de face de bouette
So tired of seeing his smarmy face everywhere
Pour moi ce sont ces pubs a la radio o√π il se montre comme le messiah de Montreal par rapport a la securite pis ces nouvelles pancartes qui misent sur le sentiment dinsecurite des gens en associant coderre avec securitaire. Gros trump vibe
Sibole y'auraient pu au moins diversifier leurs cr√©atifs. Je travaille en pub et je pense sinc√®rement pas qu'on approuverait un habillage √©pouvantable de m√™me
Every ad from Coderre makes me more and more likely to vote for Holness
My gawdü§£ü§£
his high school councillor makeover cringes me out
Web dev (that know how ads work) here, what happens is in the ad purchase they asked to get either a specific way to high visibility or turnover rate or the site has a bad turnover and the parameters are wide enough so its the only ad that can show
J'accroche pas √† ses pub d'halloween √† la radio.
This looks like the websites fault. Not the campaign.
For those of you who don't know, this looks like Google ads. Basically, for those you just upload your ad, set the target and let Google do the rest.
A very large portion of the internet uses Google ads because they are an easy way to have paid ads on your website with very little work. This site just seemed to put them everywhere, and Google ads for some reason made them all the same ad.
To be fair, they got you to share it to a larger forum.
Coderre est Iffy-cace, un con-p√©tant.
I hesitate to click on any e-commerce website anymore because I know I'll get attacked by a flood of ads just like this. Online marketers have no chill
c'est drole, jai eu la meme spam d'ads sur TVAnouvelles, mais des annonces de PM "ya de quoi sourire" ou qqchose de meme...  jme demandais honnetement si c'est 1) le parti qui achete TOUT les spots "sponsored ads" sur X site, ou 2) les vendeurs d'ads qui sont paraisseux ?

Looks like it‚Äôs time to run a Pi Hole instance as your dns server to blank all these ads.
Wow il y a encore du monde sans ad blocker?
come on... ABP, Privacy Badger. How can you live with all those ads.
Ah yes, I remember the days when I didn't have an ad blocker.
This is why you use an ad blocker, in case anyone is still wondering. There's more ad space on this page than actual article.
Google Ads... digital nonsense.
Je suis presque s√ªre que c'est ill√©gal s'il n'y a pas de pubs pour l'autre parti dans la page.
Je suis pas un fan de Plante non plus mais je pense qu'elle est beaucoup moins destructive. Plante fait chier parce qu'elle met un jardin public ou une piste cyclable o√π √ßa fait aucun bon sens, Coderre fait chier parce qu'il va vendre les bijoux de la ville √† des d√©veloppeurs pour 1$ et √ßa va ruiner des quartiers au complet.
I do think our choices come down to Plante and Coderre. Plante, for all her faults, has a plan in place. She might have shot herself in the foot many times in the process and the provincial goverment is doing everything it can to fuck with her but I think overall her plan remains solid and I can at least see they're actively investing in infrastructure. And if the worst that happens is that she has a shitty bike path installed I'm not going to stay up at night thinking about it (I bike a lot, so I want that to be a thing anyways). Coderre is a corrupt sack of shit. I can't believe people are actively contemplating voting for him. It's mind boggling.
Ben non, il veut beaucoup le bien des citoyens... qui sont aussi ces amis riches.
C't'un vieux criss de mononc. Tout comme toi, je ne trippe pas n√©cessairement sur Plante, mais je vais voter pour son parti sur toute la ligne. Mais pour ma part, c'est pas un vote pour Plante, mais bien un vote contre Coderre.

Absolument! Et quels cons chez Twitter pour l'avoir laiss√©, tout comme Trump et des milliers d'autres, propager des fausses nouvelles se validant en appellant toute v√©ritable nouvelle une fausse nouvelle.
Il y a trop de cons sur cette plan√®te pour laisser des gourous propager de la haine ainsi. La libert√© de parole ne vient pas avec le droit d'utiliser une plate-forme si ca contrevient aux bonnes r√®gles de conduite de cette plate-forme.
Un gaspillage de cellules humaines.

Get these people off mainstream platforms and we‚Äôll avoid mass radicalization like we‚Äôve seen in the US.
If they cluster on Parler, they‚Äôll have a much smaller reach and its network effects easily studied to detect at-risk clusters & individuals.
This is the classic counter terrorism cyber playbook.
Plateform like Parler have no moderator, and people posting any kind of stuff including videos of decapitation, stuff like that.  Not the kind of place matante Denise will ever post pictures of her grand child.  People there are already radicalised.  The problem with facebook is matante Denise might end up with a Qanon vid on her feed and start wondering if pedophiles rule the government.

Parler a √©t√© retir√© du Play Store [source](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/08/tech/parler-google-play-removed/index.html)
Naah forget about Parler. Those guys (Radio Quebec, StuDio, etc) are all on VK since a while.
Stu Pitt have been building his audience on VK since at least 3 years...
VK is a russian Facebook with very few rules and laws.
[deleted]
Is that a new app or ?
What made you think Parler is being shutdown? Google removing it form the Play store isn't the same as shutting it down. This isn't China where the internet gets censored and Android also isn't the locked imprisoned environment of iOS. The Apk can be side loaded.
Besides having these radicals communicate in an open forum makes it easier for law enforcement to infiltrate them and prevent terrorist attacks. Parler existing isn't a bad thing in that respect as the mainstream will reject it.

I don‚Äôt think that matters cause they‚Äôre too far gone anyway. Shutting him down may limit otherwise normal people from finding him.
It'll prevent him from increasing his base though. The existing one is a lost cause of idiots already.
I‚Äôm honestly really ok with a company limiting the promotion of toxic, racist, sexist, destructive and harmful hate speech on their platforms. This is exactly the type of content to be censored.
Twitter can do what the fuck they want. If these poor fascist assholes can't afford $10 a month to run their own website... well in Canada these fascist assholes will just blame Trudeau for literally everything. The CPC even blamed Trudeau for their own MPs being anti vaxxers LOLOL
I don't care. They're a media company and they do editing.
hmm which ones have been proven true ?
Did you drop an /s ?
What is an official position? 
Stop this bullshit fear mongering. 
If you will break *laws*, entice violence to overthrow a duly elected government, attack its institutions and clamour for heads on a pike - you deserve to be deplatformed. 
Violence is not a part of the democratic process, period, and this goes for both left & right. It just so happens that right wing extremists have a near monopoly on violent actions & murders in the US. 
Might that be because their ideologies have tendencies towards racisms, corporatism, individualism, anti-science and white supremacy? 
That‚Äôs a rhetorical.
This is a private company deciding what is acceptable use of their platform, and not the government silencing our free speech. Huge difference.
Nenenon. Pas de Chant des Anciens pour lui.

Nice pic! Ah Pizza Madona and the Belle Province across the street... my regular late-night meals after work a decade ago... I love this part of the Main. If you want a trip back in time, use Street View on Saint-Laurent from Sherbrooke to Mont-Royal at different dates. Crazy mix of places that have been there forever, buildings hosting a new business every two years and sadly, vacant spots.
Our city, our home. We see it through different eyes, but i suspect we all feel the same about montreal.

Nice. Do you have a website?
Nice one ! I got couple shots that look like that too when I used to work on Saint-Laurent 2 years ago
Why am I getting the division 2 vibes?

J'aimerais √ßa qu'un journaliste demande √† Coderre combien d'apr√®s-midi il est all√© *chiller* sur l'Espace 67 depuis son dernier mandat.
Je l'imagine bien se tirer une p'tite couverte et s'asseoir sous un soleil de plomb pour regarder son beau ciment √† perte de vue en se disant:
>  Ouah, in autre projet porteur √ßa, Denis! Criss qu'on est bon.
Ce matin je m'obstinais avec un de mes chum apr√®s lui avoir envoy√© le lien de la presse qui parle de Coderre et de l'entrepreneur en construction. Je me souvenais de ce post sur reddit qui montrait la destruction du parc jean-drapeau et j'ai r√©ussi √† le retrouver avec la recherche reddit (un miracle!) alors je me disais que c'√©tait le bon moment pour ressortir cette image sur le sub :) Le post original √©tait gracieuset√© de notre /u/Matt_MG ici : https://old.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/mrfne8/superficie_darbres_et_de_milieux_humides_d%C3%A9truits/
Ils ont pav√© le ruisseau?! 
Tabarnak‚Ä¶. Quelle honte.
I took a pic of this monstrosity on the ground a while ago. In hindsight, I remember hearing vague rumblings about this but I didn't realize how bad it was.  
https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/pf5c7m/havent\_been\_to\_jeandrapeau\_in\_years\_what\_is\_this/
Large concrete spaces with no shade are notoriously good for heat buildup. Good stuff.
Yea and because of it they moved all events to the racetrack which meant you couldn‚Äôt cycle on it and most of the time couldn‚Äôt even cut through. That summer or two was was annoying
I'm not a huge fan of what they did, but it also seems as if most people who complain about this had never been to Jean Drapeau prior to the changes. 
It wasn't as if they removed lush and dense old growth forests to make this concert venue.... they mostly just paved over what was for 6/12 months of the year a giant mud pit because of the events that were already there annually. 
Could it have been done better... yes. Did they massacre a huge beautiful forest to make a flat amptheatre no. 
iirc it was about 1000 trees they removed for the whole project. Out of just under 20,000 trees on the Island. So somewhere around 5% of the total population not including Ile notre dame.

On remarque que l'√Æle s'arr√™tait environ √† la piscine (le b√¢timent √©tait d√©j√† l√†). L'enti√®ret√© de la place Avenko √©tait dans l'eau.
Je n'essaie pas de d√©montrer quoi que ce soit avec √ßa, j'ai seulement pens√© que vous trouveriez √ßa int√©ressant.
1) Ruin Parc Jean-Drapeau
2) Blame your successors
3) Get re-elected
4) ???? (Probably shady backroom deals)
5) Profit!
for people that regularly attend festivals on the island, the change was needed.  Prior to this you would come home and essentially have dust buggers for days.  For the people complaining, do you even visit this space?  Probably not.  The open space can be used for biking/rollerblading and any other activity on wheels away from traffic.  As a regular runner, I've seen parents teaching their small children to bike on this space during the summer.  A few years back they setup a Japanese light show a la botanical gardens.  If they are smart, they can even setup some rinks for the winter.  Yes some trees were taken down but there are still plenty of sections with greenery to hang out in.
Fuck you Coderre.

Don‚Äôt forget when he dumped RAW SEWAGE into the St. Lawrence
It's not finished. They need to bring in a gigantic circular saw and "cut out" large chunks of the concrete and make tree islands out of them. Seriously, this can be done!
A few trees cut but so what? You still have many national parks if you want peace in nature. I have so many good memories of going to evenko concerts. You need to consider the entertainment value this brings to Montreal.

Et c'est probablement Coderre qui a eu des ristournes et non les montr√©alais.
C'est un parc qui appartient √† la ville non? Evenko est juste un locataire.

Ton chum aime pas les gros bloc de ciment laids?
Ben voyons donc
Knowing what it looked like before is so heartbreaking
Oh ya, I remember it well. And if you ever go there during an average weekday now that the work is done, it's a flippin' parking lot. It's complete dead. Not a soul uses that area. It's "useful" but a few times a year. How we allowed a park to be overtaken by one company for a very small handful of events is something we should never allow again.
The other travesty in this project is how it cost us taxpayers 70 million dollars and all the profits are going into Evenko's pockets. Socialize the costs and privatize profits is a scam
I think it's less about the # of trees as it is about the sheer square footage of concrete that replaced them and the small wetland areas. It's a huge heat island now, and sure, the trees that they planted will grow eventually, but in a less bio-diverse setting.
I think the point some of us are trying to make is that it should remain a park, a natural park.. not a parking lot and not a "mud pit" caused by one company. It comes down to what you want from your parks. A natural place for all, or a commercial area where one company can profit but a few times a year, leaving a "mud pit" for the remaining time. 
It also comes down to how you see your city, a tourist destination that benefits tourists a few times a year, or the actual people who live here and pay taxes.
It was not the best before those changes, but now it simply sucks (except for evenko).
In the summer, there is no way you can relax there, its simply way to hot.
Hopefully, Projet Montreal's plans to improve the site will help.
Hyde Park in London host many events too and it's not covered in concrete. It's all grass.
What Coderre did in the Jean Drapeau park is an abomination.
Aussi, l'√Æle √©tait en fait une s√©rie d'√Æles, la plus au nord s'appelant simplement l'√Æle ronde. C'est le lieu o√π sera b√¢tie la Ronde et l'origine de son nom!
Le fr√®re de mon ami fait partie d'un groupe militant pour prot√©ger le parc.  
Le groupe a d√©j√† contact√© et le maire d'arrondissement, Alan DeSousa et Val√©rie Plante et les deux veulent prot√®ger le parc.  
Cependant ce n'est pas la ville de Montr√©al qui loue le terrain √† l'AdeM, c'est le gouvernement f√©d√©ral.  
Ni l'a√©roport, ni le f√©d√©ral disent que c'est leur probl√®me.

Makes me wonder how Montreal would have evolved if we kept older architectural styles as we grew the city!
J‚Äôai pris un bon caf√© dans le centre du parc, j‚Äôai pas tellement remarqu√© les maisons mais ils sont pas mal comme tu l‚Äôes a dessin√©! C‚Äôest cute!
"Montreal's Moving Castle" :)
Lol and I forgot the orange cone sticking out of it too
Thank you :-)
Je connais la s√©ries t√©l√©vis√©e mais je n'ai jamais su qu'il y avait un bande dessin√©e
I live literally a half block away, feel like I get disenchanted with it. Nice to see a fresh perspective
En fait je pense que c‚Äô√©tait un livre avant la s√©rie
J'adore, tu as m√™me mis les oiseaux sur la statue.   
\+++
Le monument aux h√©ros canadiens de la guerre des Boers. C'est durant cette guerre, en Afrique du Sud, qu'ont √©t√© mis en place par les Britanniques parmi les tous premiers camps de concentration. Et y'a un peu de Montr√©al l√†-dedans! Ceci dit, c'est la seule statut √©questre √† Montr√©al et on peut pas nier qu'elle ait fi√®re allure.
Beautiful!
Umm wow. Do you sell any of your pieces?
j'admire ton talent!
En temps que dinosaure contemporain, j'aimerais tellement que les cartes postales se modernisent avec des cr√©ations comme la tienne plut√¥t que les classiques photos plates!
this  is fantastic.
Very nice.
Love it!
Nicely done!
üëç
It just look so cool .. wanna se more for sure ;)
Beautiful urban sketching. Love the purple tree trunk.
stunning!
At night it's something else üòÇ
Les oiseaux sont un partie du parc pour moi lol et ils ont vraiment fait ca, c'etait un jour tres chaud.
En fait, les canadiens fran√ßais supportaient m√™me les Boers !
It's literally a monument to imperialism!
Merci, je toujours apprend quelque chose nouveau quand je mis un peinture ici.
Oui, j'aimerais savoir aussi!
Thank you, yes I do. Hopefully this won't be seen as spam since people are asking for information. Here's links to shortcut finding stuff on my site: [Original paintings of Canada](https://www.artkarolina.com/product-category/original-art-for-sale/oa-subject/og-canada/), [art prints of Montreal](https://www.artkarolina.com/product-category/art-prints-for-sale/montreal-travel-art/), and I just started this where I will take [art commissions of locations from photos](https://www.artkarolina.com/art-commissions/) (and if I can, I will probably visit them) - scroll down to the travel art section. Painting Montreal has become my "thing" over the last several years and I've really come to appreciate the city by doing urban sketching.
In case you're looking for buying this particular painting, I sold it already so it's only available as a print.
Merci :) Je fait les cartes postales moi-meme, mais si je voulais les vendre au magasin c'est different - le magasin ou le imprimeur doivent m'accepter et si quel qu'un voudrait m'aider avec ca je l'apprecie!
Thank you, it's something I started doing with the shadows many years ago and I much prefer it over heavy browns, grays, or blacks.
I mean, even in the daytime if you come at the wrong time it is something else.
Je suis un amoureux de Montr√©al, mais je ne connais pas beaucoup de gens l√†-bas, alors quand j'y vais, je prend une petite chambre chez les soeurs grises, et je passe mes journ√©es √† me promener ; j'ai reconnu ton parc au premier regard car j'y ait pass√© des heures enti√®res √† regarder la dynamique des oiseaux.  
√âtant un homme de r√©gion, voir la nature en ville, √ßa m'enchante. Voir les Montr√©alais aussi.   
J'vous aime, peace !
C'est difficile de faire plus imp√©rialiste que √ßa. C'est m√™me √©crit sur le monument:   
*In grateful recognition of the patriotism and public spirit shown by Lord Strathcona and Mount Royal in raising and equipping a regiment of horse for service in South Africa as evidence of his sympathy with the cause of imperial unity.*
yeah, beautiful isn't it.
Merci, j'ai r√©pondu dans la dernier comment plus haut.
Wonderful, thanks for sharing. I have several paintings of various Montreal locations during spring, summer, and winter from the same artist but I‚Äôve wondered if I should get one of the Fall. I will check out your website üòÄ
Yeah more fall ones are on my to do list. I usually go hiking in the fall instead so haven't done too many.
J'le trouve magnifique notre nouveau pont!
Magnifique! Envoie √ßa sur r/bridgeporn
C'est de toute beaut√©
Qui est-ce qu'on devrait dessiner sur un des pilliers? P-e Norm Macdonald?
On a vraiment eu des beaux couchers de soleil dernierement!
Whaaaa ! Crissement belle cette photo ! ...je n'ai jamais marcher ce pont encore....c a faire!
Ouais! 
C‚Äôest sick
Fucking belle photo! Bravo; j'adore!
Thanks for sharing. So beautiful
Amazing picture. üëåüèº
Vraiment oui! Et tout un training le mont√© √† v√©lo
^(ou je suis pas assez en forme haha)
Merci! Je vais faire √ßa!
Merci beaucoup!
Personnellement je crois que je laisserais blanc pour le moment. Je le trouve tr√®s "classe"
Oui vraiment !
Merci beaucoup! 
Oui il vaut la peine!
Merci!
Merci beaucoup!
Thank you!
* Le pont Jacques-Quartier a joint la discussion *
Magnifique photo!
Le truc c'est de venir du c√¥t√© Montr√©al avec le vent dans le dos.
Merci! 
Ooh ouais il est assez rough le pont. Ce soir l√† ma conjointe et moi √©tions parti ensemble pour faire une sortie photo √† v√©lo. Elle voulait faire du v√©lo et moi de la photo alors... on a mixer nos id√©es. Ce qu'on as d√©couvert sur notre retour est que le passage √† v√©lo du pont Victoria ferme apr√®s une certaine heure. Alors on as d√ª passer par le pont Jacques Cartier et damn que c'est pas le pont le plus facile √† v√©lo!

Fait int√©ressant sur l'√©glise Saint Michael et Saint Anthony: √† la base c'√©tait une √©glise pour la communaut√© irlandaise (si vous passez proche, observer les formes de tr√®fles sur le d√¥me). Elle s'appelait d'ailleurs seulement "St Michael". √âventuellement, ils vont "merger" avec la communaut√© polonaise et changer le nom. Ils partagent donc l'√©glise.
Beautiful! Is your work for sale?
Is that an Orthodox Jew on the right? The hat looks familiar.
Where can I buy your arttttttttt
Or am I doomed to only ever find it on Reddit for all eternity?
love this! i lived in mile end just before moving to germany and this is making me homesick..
also i would absolutely smash a st viateur bagel right now
J‚Äôadore et √ßa me rappelle que je m‚Äôennuie de prendre des marches dans ce coin l√† ‚ù§Ô∏è
I used to live on that corner! Man, I miss my 3am bagel runs...
this is one of my favourite intersections üòå
Love it! Please update once your art is available for purchase
Nice. My wife is an artist so I get to be exposed to a lot of art. (sounds dirty) You have a sense of whimsy that will titillate you and reach your audience. Love the contrast between hard and soft, light and dark. I feel invited to stroll along and listen for what may come along.  Lovely!
Love this soooo much used to be my old neighbourhood looking from the ymca haha wat paper and brand of water colours do u use I do line drawings but it might be fun to add watercolour
Wow I basically live around there, please let me know when you start selling prints, would love to get one!
Beautiful
I love it!
Lovely!
Gorgeous
Definitely reminds me of Montreal... been gone for around 4 years now
oh wow!! √† c√¥t√© de chez moi
Love it
wow thanks! it comes after lots of failed drafts and lots of frustration so reading that makes me happy!
Merci pour l'anecdote √ßa fait toujours plaisir !
wow int√©ressant! j'avais remarqu√© les tr√®fles.
Thanks!! Not yet! And this one needs at least another iteration but I'm going to set up prints of a few of Montreal scenes soon. I finally found a print shop and was happy with the print quality. I'll keep you posted!
yes! -
 those hats have the best name! it's a shtreimel <3
Ahhh thanks ! I'm working on this and will keep you posted!
So good straight out of their wood burning oven!
so much character and good bagels :)
thanks! I'm working on this!
Thanks so much for this comment!  <3
It's a great neighbourhood - I miss going to the YMCAsoooooo much! 
I use Windsor & Newton watercolors on 25% cotton cold press paper but I think whatever you use is fine! For sure watercolors turn out nicer on watercolor paper though.  It's trial and error with watercolors but a lot of fun! Also, if you're going to mix with water, use archival ink waterproof pens and save yourself the frustration of seeing your nice lines melt with the water on the paper.
It's such an interesting neighbourhood. I live there too! I'm still sorting out the prints but I'll let you know!
thank you!
:) thanks!
<3
thanks !
with lockdown It's not quite the montreal you left 4 years ago, but the bagels are still being served out of the wood fire oven!
cool :)
thanks!!
me too!
<3
I think I miss the bagels the most. The bagels in Toronto are crap.
On peut dire que c‚Äôest  toujours le cas en 2020 aussi vu l‚Äô√©tat de la chauss√©e
Les vendeurs de pare-brises ont du faire une petite fortune.
√ßa aurait du rest√© un tramway et plein d'arbres
Always thought it was a ridiculously narrow space for 6 lanes, 
makes sense that it was only intended to have 4.
C'√©tait toujours aussi laid...
The D√©carie and the 40: two embarrassing blights on the city.
Can you imagine coming to Montr√©al for the first time, entering the city from the east, and taking the 40 and then the 15 south?
Honnetement, c'est la pire autoroute que j'ai pass√©. C'est 70km/h, mais tout le monde va √† 110 et te traite comme un fou si tu oses suivre la lois.
It was a mess back then and it still is.
The fact that you exit right into traffic lights is crazy, but the worst for me is the need to cross lanes. Most of the traffic jams in Decarie going north are caused by upcoming traffic turning into the 40 East, and at the same time cars merging into Decarie in the Jean Talon entry going West. It just blows my mind how badly designed the whole thing was, specially when i have to drive by every morning (or had to, thanks Covid!).
that concrete is so smooth and bright :D
Cette autoroute me donne envie de me pr√©senter √† la mairie avec comme √©l√©ment principale de ma plateforme de remplir D√©carie avec de l'eau et d'en faire un canal. Je vais √™tre le premier a faire du paddleboard dessus.
Quoi? ce n‚Äôest pas toujours le cas? on dirait une route en gravier en tout cas...
I drive this everyday and am blown away by the potholes that constantly return in the exact same place due to horrible repairs
Beginning of the end.
√áa a aid√© en rien de rajouter des voies, √ßa bloque √† cause des sorties et de l'√©changeur qui sont pas capables de prendre le d√©bit.
Wow d‚Äôo√π vient cette photo?
Je te dis. Les chars des ann√©es 1960 l'air chic.
LOL, il y a aussi toujours des voies en gravier!
Le vendeur de garnotte itou!
Avec une piste cyclable et une guillotine pour les banlieusards qui s‚Äôinfiltrent en auto dans la ville.
Il devrait m'√™tre un toit dessous. √Ä Boston il en fait sa, c'est vraiment superbe. Les toit a des parcs est des places pour des resto durant l'√©t√©.
It was always intended to have 6

> Can you imagine coming to Montr√©al for the first time, entering the city from the east, and taking the 40 and then the 15 south?
Can you imagine spending your life in Ottawa?
even worse is the dorval circle. i had an uncle fly in to visit in the mid 90s, it was under construction. couple years ago he flew in again, and asked "wtf its still under construction?"
Urban highways are always ugly, unless it's a tunnel. It's either an urban highway or a neighborhood that's super slow to drive through like the Plateau.
Huh? What's wrong with the 40 and the 15?
At the time it was all planned, A-20 was supposed to run across the Ville-Marie route and connect with Av. Souligny to get to the tunnel.
So approaching from the northeast, if you were heading downtown you would just head down to A-20 for the direct access.
720 has entered the chat.
Or arriving by plane and the first thing you see is the Dorval Circle? Or even worse Mirabel in a corn field.
As tu pris le nouveau pont Champlain ? 110 t'es mieux de te tenir √† droite sur les 4 flashers !
as-tu pass√©e la une fois ou y'avait pas de trafic peut-√™tre? Car je peux t'assurer que ca roule pas toujours en fou!
Meme si le debit augmentais sur l'echangeur, sa ferais juste pousser le probleme a un peu plus tard. Si tu ajoute de la capacite, l'humain vas l'utiliser avec plus de voitures.
Tout aurait √©t√© mieux s'ils avaient construit l'autre autoroute nord-sud dans l'axe du boulevard St-Laurent! /s
Oui, et c'√©tait garanti de crever dans un accident, ils n'avaient pas de zones d'absorbtion ni de ceintures de s√©curit√©. 
Y'avait facilement 20-30 morts par semaine sur les routes dans ce temps-l√†.
ashes to ashes, gravel to gravel
Pas autant que le vendeur de ciment!
Peut-√™tre un jour √ßa aurait regarder comme [cette autoroute] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheonggyecheon) mais je r√™ve.
>[...] et aussi en direction de la Transcanadienne projet√© d'est en ouest sur l'√Æle de Montr√©al.
J'imagine qu'ils parlent de la 20 qui devait originalement traverser l'√Æle par le sud (√† travers le vieux-montr√©al plut√¥t que de partager un tron√ßon de route avec la 10/15/132 sur la Rive-sud.
&nbsp;
Aussi : 
>C'est en effet √† cette date [printemps 1967] que le boulevard D√©carie troquera d√©finitivement son nom pour celui d'Autoroute D√©carie et offrira aux automobilistes, **au lieu des embouteillages d'antan**, ses six voies √† circulation rapide, entour√©es de chaque c√¥t√© par trois voies de service √† sens unique.
... lol!
20M wow maintenant pour 20M on a un petit overpass lol
[deleted]
C'est pas serr√© du tout. Les voies d'autoroute ont la m√™me largeur que partout ailleurs.
Ottawa - the town that fun forgot.
no cap
Haha touch√©
Don't get me wrong, I love my city, but these two stretches of highway are some of the worst in Canada in terms of urban planning and aesthetics.
Highways bad!
Traffic is pretty awful from 7am to 7pm moat days. Some intersections are just designed to be congested. And potholes.
Faut en profiter pendant que c'est encore smooth!
Elle √©tait cens√©e √™tre sur Papineau; c'est d'ailleurs pour √ßa que Papineau est pleine de magasins k√©taines qui √©taient suppos√©s √™tre d√©molis...
Y'aurait eu aussi l'autoroute Mont-Royal qui partait de D√©carie et Monkland, serait pass√©e dans Villa Maria pour passer dans un tunnel sous la Montagne qui serait ressorti √† Rachel et Parc, pour passer au nord du campus de l'UQAM qui aurait √©t√© √©rig√© sur le quadrilat√®re Rachel - St-Urbain - Des Pins et St-Denis, apr√®s avoir tout d√©moli ce qui s'y trouvait...

Wow you managed to get such a good view of the mountains to the south! It's not everyday you can see that far so clearly!
gorgeous sunrise üëå
I love my cat. Really. But he makes me see the sunrise every morning because he‚Äôs ‚Äúhungry‚Äù (he wants pets).
So beautiful! Thanks for sharing with us.
Tu es ou environs??
I guess you don't get to see the sunrise because even from a highrise because of other ones blocking you.
J‚Äôhabite au 3√®me maintenant mais c‚Äôest au-dessus des autres immeubles, et les lev√©s du soleil par la fen√™tre valent chaque dollar.
Those are the mountains to the east, otherwise the Sun wouldn't be coming up behind them ;)
Thanks^^
Selon la vue, il est quelque part sur le mont-royal, au niveau de la rue Peel environ.
Even with the skyscrapers you can fully see the [sun rising in the horizon](https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/nj0iss/just_to_show_that_you_can_fully_see_the_sunrise/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
"Montreal South"
Oui Peel proche du vieux port
Non... Proche du mont-royal. On voit pointe-saint-charles et le pont victoria
Lol bro la rue Brennan et prince dans le vieux port c‚Äôest √† 5 min du pont Victoria vas voir Google map
Lol bro mon point est que le pont victoria est au fond fond faik lol bro l'angle est donc pas proche du vieux port. Et aussi meme si c'etait le cas, mon point demeure parce que on essayait de pinpoint de ou est pris la photo, et donc 5 mins de char "c'est loin" si tessaie d'aller au vieux-port pour re-cr√©er la photo. 
Donc non, dans les 2 cas c'est pas proche. C'est proche dans le sens hey ctu a montreal ou a blainville, ca oui si c'est proche..
Ahhh ok oui je viens de voir tu as absolument raison
C‚Äôest pas le pont victoria √ßa en passant
Y'avait quand m√™me beaucoup de gens en v√©lo hier (en fin d'apr√®s midi).
Gosh, je m'ennuis de p√©daler dans la neige. Avec le t√©l√©travail, pas ben ben de v√©lo possible entre mon lit et mon bureau.
*High-five* guy on a bike. That was me yesterday in Laval and its still pretty hell on the roads right now. My little 5km commute normally takes 10-15 minutes depending on wind. It took 40 yesterday.
Oui, le velo durant l'hiver c'est tres Montreal.
I am so impressed by these cyclists! I can't even walk in snow aside from a penguin shuffle, kudos to the real Quebecois!

Le v√©lo d'hiver explose vraiment ces temps-ci. J'habite pas loin du REV Saint-Denis, pis je suis surpris de toujours voir du monde, m√™me quand il neige. Bon pour notre plan√®te.
Moi aussi, √ßa me manque de commut√© au bureau en v√©lo.  
Je vais attendre √† demain que √ßa soit un peu plus d√©gager avant de sortir faire ma loop sur le REV st-denis.
J'ai jamais fait de v√©lo en hiver. Comment √ßa se compare √† l'√©t√© en terme d'effort physique et confort?
Fais le tour du quartier? :)
un classique parmis les classiques.
Mes d√©placements quotidiens cet hiver se passent √† peu pr√®s tous sur St-Denis et Bellechasse. M‚Äôa te dire, je passe un excellent moment en v√©lo.
J'aimerais ben √ßa aussi... Je vais voir si je peux pas me trouver une shop de v√©lo d'ouvert...
Il y a juste un peu plus de facteurs en prendre en compte.
Id√©alement, √ßa prend des pneus en cons√©quence. De bons crampons, voire des clous, vont te donner une excellente adh√©rence dans la plupart des situations, mais C'est sur que plus il y a de neige, plus √ßa glisse et moins t'as de traction. Par contre les jours o√π la chauss√©e est vraiment enneig√©e sont plus rares. Donc pour l'effort physique la majorit√© du temps, on peut p√©daler tranquille sans se faire chier. Par rapport au confort, √ßa d√©pend de ta monture et de tes choix de v√™tements. Perso, j'avais √† peu pr√®s toujours trop chaud... Avec un bon syst√®me multicouches, c'est parfait. Les plus fragiles sont les mains, mais il y a des solutions pour √ßa aussi. Des trucs pour recouvrir les guidons, avec de bonne mitaines. En ce qui me concerne, j'avais des bonnes mitaines de ski, avec un gant √† l'int√©rieur. Faut faire attention √† ne pas couper la circulation aussi, donc faire attention au poids qu'on absorbe sur le guidon. Les bottes d'hiver sont un must aussi. Voil√† en gros! Dans tout les cas, le plaisir de rouler sur une petite neige fra√Æche le matin vaut tous les mauvais c√¥t√©s!
Et j'ajouterais, les lunettes de ski ou un casque avec visi√®re sont indispensables!
Oui √©ventuellement, mais mon v√©lo a besoin d'aller √† l'h√¥pital des v√©los, et avec la covid et tout, √ßa √©t√© rel√©gu√© loin dans les priorit√©s comme je n'en ai pas besoin pour mon commute.
Super r√©sum√©! Je rajouterais qu'avec le REV, c'est incroyablement p√©nard de circuler. C'est hyper agr√©able car tu y vas √† ton rythme sans stresser pour les chars.
bookmark pour un futur personnage de roman qui fera du v√©lo en hiver
I know it was finals week but they could have at least posted things they didn‚Äôt need for free on Facebook Marketplace or donate it so people who would need furniture or stuff like that could just come and pick up instead of throwing out everything in the street like trash.
Is all of that being thrown out? Talk about wasteful
Looks to be a decent office chair in that mess among other gems. What a shame as I wasn‚Äôt far from there today I would have swung by and picked some items.
Le nom de la rue... :/
Sadly these people most likely didn‚Äôt pay a penny for their rent or furniture; likely funded by the Bank of Mom and Dad. They didn‚Äôt work for it so they don‚Äôt respect these items and also they don‚Äôt respect their neighbours.
It's like this all over the ghetto. It's absolutely disgusting. The sidewalk on Prince Arthur was almost completely blocked by furniture and junk when i passed by this afternoon.
Quand j'allais a McGill (j'avais des cours au gym, c'est plus rapide de marcher a travers le ghetto a partir du metro), je voyais ca **tous les jours**.
C'etait vraiment degeu et trise.
Lots of cheaply made furniture with a short lifespan. Landlords charge tenants if the leave furniture behind. So instead it gets thrown to the curb.
Montreal's best thrift store is open again for a limited time only... returns again July 1
Our street (Saint-Urbain) looks like a garbage dump... Didn't wanna do another post with pictures... I have a question though, does the city know about this? are they going to pick this garbage before next wednesday? or is this gonna stay until then? It's gonna be raining during the week and some of this 'garbage' is actual garbage (food stuff etc...). It's already disgusting as it is. 
Extra vent: they could have at least put scavengeable things separately, I've seen a vacumm cleaner in perfect condition (among many other things like printers and such) but it was covered in disgusting things so couldn't even take it -.-.
And so many of these kids spend have their days virtue signalling online about sustainability issues.
There was a post on r/McGill asking why McGill ghetto is called a ghetto.
I think this answers that question pretty well.
Lol I lived downtown for ten years, this is usually what end of semester looks like
Uncivilized barbarians
Dunno why renters don't rent places with basic furnishings (bed frame, +/- mattress, dressers, desk, chair, sofa, dining tables) and then just collect damage deposit for broken things? 
Would be easier and don't have to throw everything out afterwards.
Im new at Montreal, wtf is going on?
Ahhh la future √©lite du pays.
Why May 1? Moving day is July 1...?
Wait until July 1 and the rest of the city will look like this (although at a smaller scale because you don't have an entire neighborhood moving out at once.)
They should fine these assholes.
Dang, 1er juillet en mai cette ann√©e?
PROPERTY VALUE GOING UP KACHING. Disrespectful idiots!
So long, Marianne!
The future leaders of our country
There are Facebook groups that would have rehomed the stuff easily like montrealers helping montrealers . I have seen so many things get a second life there and people asking for things they need and someone offering to drive it over . This is so wasteful and makes people look like slobs.
As a McGill student, I‚Äôm embarrassed :(
That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt let her go through your phone
To think that I once have spend >$300 hiring garbage collectors to collect my couches, and these people just dump them on the street!
Gang de sauvages.
C'est des gens √©duqu√© qui font √ßa? Holy f\*ck!

Someone getting evicted on the 1st of the month by the looks of it. Happens in my ghetto too. South Oshawa, ON.
All that sector looked like a shithole yesterday. I saw so much trash and crap all over the street on St-Urbain yesterday.
Damn this is on my street..I know exactly where that is  and who did this too...it‚Äôs right at the bottom of Sainte-Famille just before Sherbrooke.

When mommy and daddy pay to refurnish your new place every year
Presque autant de meubles que de pixels
Undoubtedly this is horrible... but this happens every May 1st. Clearly the city needs to do something about it.
When I last moved I had to drive a good 20 kilometers to dump a mattress (it was in horrible condition and nobody wanted to take it for free). Keep in mind that these people are students and driving a U-Haul truck for an extra 20 kilometers isn't an amazing option. 
The city could introduce a service where they charge $50/$100 per apartment to pick up all this stuff. I am sure people would be interested.
Nice.
This is our new generation of smart kids. Welcome to 2021

Memories of losing $250 playing Texas Hold 'Em poker! 
(Back in the days when I thought I'd be a poker champ, but the Casino de Montreal taught me the harsh realities of life, probability and statistics instead!)
Lovely work. Colours, composition, and post-processing is all on point. 
Well done!
J'y suis all√© 3 fois dans ma vie sans succes malgr√© mes connaissances.
Les 3 fois c'etais avec les meme amis dont un, les 3 fois arriv√© sur place nous surprends en ayant pas amen√© une cenne et nous demande de lui passer 5$. Pas de probleme pour un ami genereux, il nous partageais beaucoup d'alcool etc. Un bon gars.
Les 3 fois y'as reussi a monter entre 3 et 500$ sur un coup de chance incroyable. Le gars etais chanceux comme 10. 
Le gars as jamais sorti de la avec plus de 20$. On en rie souvent.
She's beautiful.
I miss it. Last time I was there was Christmas 2019
I really don't like this building. I don't know I just find it lacks boundaries for me and seems like it's trying too hard.  Maybe I'm missing a perspective to appreciate it differently
I love seeing pictures of my investments
Belle photo!
people here on this subreddit really like the casino
That‚Äôs a lot of flags, what flags are those?
Ah que j'en ai perdu du cash dans cette place l√† rendu quand j'venais d'avoir 18...
$250? Those are rookie numbers. 
I lose/win that in the same orbit, heck in some of my games that‚Äôs likely a preflop bet size
Unless you played the high roller tables, the casino actually taught you one single lesson.
The house always wins.
Support Playground Poker instead. They know how to treat their clientele as opposed to the miserable employees at the Casino.
Thanks! Funny story, I was there for about 5 minutes setting up my tripod for the sunset before security came out to ask me to leave. Apparently you need a special pass to take photos on site. Nonetheless, I got what I was hoping for at the very least.
Go to Playground Poker. They treat you way better and you eat and drink for free and free massages.
Oh yeah did I mention that they treat you way better than the miserable louts that work at the Casino?
Well, Expo 67 was every country coming together to see who can try-hard the most.
The actual Casino is a dump too compared to most other major metropolitan areas.
Look at Mr. Moneybags over here!
Ok, thanks for the tip! 
Currently just started watching Daniel Negreanu's master class videos, and planning on reading a few more strategy books. After that I'll put aside a couple of hundred dollars here and there, and practice in person, with live people. 
So I'll definitely try Playground Poker like you mentioned. 
(Probably when more people are vaccinated and the Corona-Virus begins to die down a bit.) 
--------------------------------
Also just wanted to ask you: 
As for the skill level of the poker players, would you say they are more skilled/difficult to beat at Playground, or at the Casino? 
If they're easier to beat at the Casino, maybe I should try back there first, even if the employees are not the friendliest? 
BUT... if the difficulty level of players is pretty much identical between Playground and the Casino, then for sure: I'd much rather be in a better environment, that's for sure! 
I've never actually been to Playground. 
--------------------------------
Side note: I had once mentioned to my GF that we should check out Playground club... and she was like, "Playground? Is that a Swinger's club or something?!" Lol!
That‚Äôs preposterous. I‚Äôve never heard of anything like that. You‚Äôre allowed to photograph in public.
Bouffe, breuvages, et massages gratuit?
√áa coute combien la partie avec ces avantages-l√†?
Lmao how is this guy getting downvoted? Mtl casino has overprixced food/alcohol while most casinos in most cities have free booze at the very least. The only things the Montreal casino will ever give you are a free Diet Coke and easy ATM access
Playing 1/2 or 2/5 win rate is the same, but you pay much less rake at 2/5 in comparison. 
PLO or short deck is where the moneys at now anyways
Both 1/2 are identically garbage at either. Go to PG during hockey/sports games, it‚Äôs a donkfest
The best way to practice, right now, are some of the live app games that are interactive and you play with free tokens.
I just find the surly attitude of just about every Casino employee such a turn off. Rude and unhelpful and unfriendly. They‚Äôre unionized and it‚Äôs a cushy government job where you can‚Äôt really get fired and they know that.
Playground is INCREDIBLE! Unlimited food and beverage and alcohol while you play and valet parking. Yes there‚Äôs definitely a higher caliber of players there though but also lots of whales which is easy money.
For the record I go around once a month with my best friend and we play the same table so we relax and socialize. If I lose 100 bucks I drank and ate like a king while doing so.
I've been turned away many times shooting buildings, also the A25 bridge back when it was under construction.
Architecture can be copyrighted. They can ask you not to take picture of the building as they want to retain control on how it is portrayed.
It is still a part of copyright laws that is less known and even less enforced I would say.
Vous doivent juste jouer. Si vous n‚Äô√™tes pas √† une table c‚Äôest pas gratuit. Mais si tu joue il y a steak gratuit, pizza, bi√®re, etc.
Playgrounds rake is fucking high tho especially at 1/2
Thanks for the support.
I have to agree with you that the crap tables could have lower price not only in the weekday
15$ for the pass is a bit too high. A bit of diversity like the roulette tables would be great.
1/2 and 2/5 tables during F1 weekend ü§ë
How long ago have you been? Cause it‚Äôs changed. You don‚Äôt have access to everything at the lower blind tables
That‚Äôs printing
Quoi?
Nourrir et souler du monde co√ªte encore plus cher que de les voler au Poker?
Ben voyons donc!
It‚Äôs been awhile since around February 2020. What‚Äôs the minimum now for the free grub?
Can‚Äôt remember, just know that you wont be eating a filet mignon at 1/2
There‚Äôs still a free food menu at 1/2, can get shit like pasta/burgers/poutine/salad
Didn‚Äôt say there wasn‚Äôt any free food at 1/2
Ah yes, the good old McGill U. campus shuttle. I kept my student ID card from the mid-90s and was able to catch free rides between Sainte Anne de Bellevue and downton untill the late 2000s when they installed a RFID chip reader and quickly flashing my card to the driver no longer worked.
That's the McGill campus shuttle, which ferries students to the Macdonald campus in Sainte-Anne.
Normally they have some red decoration with the school name, so this is probably a new addition/replacement.
I miss downtown üò≠üò≠-a Vermonter that misses Montr√©al and all of you Canadians up there!!!!
Bro the way the bus b O U N C E s
Concordia has a similar old-style shuttle bus that took students between the downtown Sir George Williams campus and the NDG Loyola campus.
Prison bus!!
Un autobus scolaire ~~jaune~~blanc?
This bus is the reason I moved downtown.
That's not an old bus. It even has an LED sign. It's just really ugly and looks out of date.
NOW THISSSSSSSSSSSSSSS ON THE OTHER HAND
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lgCUYl7KCo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lgCUYl7KCo)
Why does every shot of Montreal make it look like an Eastern European third world country ?
I knew people who did the same to get to work the few years after they graduated!
Wow RFID chip reader clearly didn‚Äôt last long, we've just flashed our cards briefly to the driver for the past 5 years!
Just wait until they connect A35 and I-89. You‚Äôll be able to get here in noooo time haha
[deleted]
It still does as far as I know (or used to right before covid)
hey mcgill isn‚Äôt *that* bad
The mix of... dirty winter sloshy snow and its distinct brutalist architecture. Although it's not very present here. Idk.
I‚Äôm gonna guess you have limited experience with actual Eastern European third world countries.
Ya I was going to say I don't remember any RFID chip card. I was using the shuttle 5-7 years ago, though, and we had to have a semester-specific sticker on the card
I didn‚Äôt know they were connecting 35 to 89. That will be great! I live about 20 minutes from the border on 89 so it will be a breeze
ü´Ç thanks haha. I can‚Äôt wait to come back
They got rid of the semester sticker again, so it's just flash your ID to board, although there's a 2 day pre-registration now in Covid times.
NGL I expected Leonard Cohen
That‚Äôs very cool! Where is that?
That's by earth crusher
https://www.instagram.com/p/BXjBYdrBRG9/?igshid=fba1a7n2c2ub
Not new - been there for ages and it‚Äôs great. It‚Äôs on St Mathieu right off st catherine in downtown.
that's EARTH CRUSHER, big fan
Earth Crusher!!
C‚Äô√©tait un po√®me l√† on dirait ?
I lived right on that apartment !! This is a few years old...
Should have been a Titan.
Yeah my boi Earthcrusher is still holding it down!
Pretty and ominous
Does anyone know where I can buy prints of artwork from any of the Ashop crew?
Earth Crusher!!! Love his work
Murals are just one of a long list of things I love about Montreal!
r/im14andthisisdeep/
Montreal reddit starter pack: a)Leonard Cohen mural, b)Farine Five Roses (particularly the neon sign), c)Mount-royal lookout,  Oh, and let's not forget d)Poutine
Its actually Cohen as kid with his mother
I'm actually kinda disappointed that it's not.
wait we have a Leonard Cohen mural?? WHERE?!?!!?
Meanwhile all my colleagues that would ask me for a tour of the city were so touched when I would take them to see our "tribute to Anthony Bourdain" mural on Crescent street...
http://ecoquartierpetermcgill.org/en/2017/03/25/two-new-murals-in-the-peter-mcgill-neighbourhood/
Also a better angle
Saint Marc, like a block away from St Catherine
Yeah I believe he has another mural on or near Clark too in the Plateau near Rachel and Duluth
Oh snap, that's by the place where I get my clothing tailored
‚ÄúAges‚Äù.
It‚Äôs been there for 4 years
St. Marc, not Mathieu
Edit: I was wrong. It is on St Mathieu
/r/ImOldSoThingsSuckNow
Gotta be honest I don't see enough poutine on this sub. Cohen pics are weekly or sometimes even daily. But poutine? My eyes and stomach demand more
You forgot about bain colonial
non, en faite c'est Anthony Nimoy
Thanks! Heading there once it's done raining!
Dang kids get off my lawn.
It‚Äôs been there for a couple years...not ages
https://goo.gl/maps/4piSDYrq95TnJGeM7
It's on St. Mathieu, not Marc
I'm glad I don't see poutine.  I'm trying to lose my covid 15
Oh I forgot to add Orange Julep. That can count as a double since the poutine at the Orange Julep is good.
C'est Leonard Nemoy, voyons donc
Hey, sorry, it's actually St Mathieu. Just a block away
Ah damn really? I might have to try them one day, I usually just grab a pogo
√áa d√©pend de ce que tu veux dire par "√† l'habitude", √ßa commence √† faire longtemps que c'est comme √ßa ;)

Vous n'avez pas de neige a Montr√©al ? ü§î
C'est vrai que √ßa fait vraiment diff√©rent des 364 autres journ√©es dans l'ann√©e! Belle photo en passant
Le Vieux-Montr√©al est habituellement jam pack en √©t√© , et m√™me jusqu‚Äôen d√©cembre facilement avec les touristes , les h√¥tels , les restaurants qui font des √©v√®nements , des banquets , des mariages , etc etc . Dire que le Vieux-Montr√©al est toujours vide ? Come on .
Ca ferait de beaux casse-t√™tes, surtout la premi√®re!

Ca a pas mal fondue la semaine pass√©e
Haha si quelqu‚Äôun a une proposition de titre je suis pr√™te √† le changer :) Mon dieu merci je pensais pas qu‚Äôelles allaient √™tre autant populaires!
Exactement, le titre dit qu‚Äôen ce moment c‚Äôest beaucoup moins occup√© que d‚Äôhabitude!
J‚Äôy avait pas pens√©! Mais oui quand m√™me :)
Merci tellement!! J‚Äôai juste utilis√© mon cellulaire en fait
Geez thanks! I might start posting more of the pictures I take while on walks of our great city :)
Same same but different
"Band√©" est aussi un mot.
Absolument d‚Äôaccord avec ton titre , c‚Äôest les commentaires bas de gamme plus haut qui me chicotaient .
IPhone? Je veux integrer la photo a mes randonnees.  
C'est impressionant de voir a quel point les cameras de telephones sont rendus performantes (relativement).
Yessss do it, what you got here is so good! If you ever wanna meet and duo shoot, let me know, I love downtown photography, just recently came from a recent shoot in China town and old port ^^
Oui absolument iPhone11 :) 
Je prends des photos partout o√π je vais et j‚Äôai l‚Äôimpression que √ßa me permet de plus appr√©cier la beaut√© des lieux et de la nature.
Fun fact: the building in the thumbnail was later donated to McGill and was used for the CIA MkUltra project.
I recommend the documentary "The Rise and Fall of English Montreal" for a interesting look at this period among others, though the documentary exudes a bit much Anglo arrogance.
Les gens parlent de Montr√©al comme √©tant la capital financi√®re du Canada dans le temps. C'est clairement pas la population qui en profitait.

√âdith : Matt McGachy, pas Lord Worm. Mes excuses.
When we say that Canada is 3 mining companies and 1 lumber company in a trenchcoat, this is what we're talking about.
Ah, la belle √©poque!
Well now 99% of the wealth is held by 1%
And in 1497, when John Cabot arrived... 99% of the wealth was with one individual...
Thomson House on McTavish is owned by McGill Graduate Students and is paid for mostly by food and alcohol sales.  I spent a lot of time there....
That‚Äôs where Trudeau‚Äôs family house is.
Has anything changed?
Et ils √©taient tous blancs est la meilleure donn√©e pour comprendre ce ph√©nom√®ne.  /s

‚ÄúDuring the Quiet Revolution, some of the businesses created in Montreal, on whose fortunes the Square Mile had been built, moved to Toronto.‚Äù
Gee... wonder what happened.
Il y a bien de rumeurs de corps enterr√© derri√®re ce b√¢timent dont tu parles (ravenscrag)
Very fun!
Funny how many people still think that it is a mere conspiracy theory, when the US government has released the documents related to this project a long time ago.
Oh! Is this the Allan Memorial?!
> though the documentary exudes a bit much Anglo arrogance
couldn't tell from the title
Any link? I only found a 12 min version of it on youtube, can't seem to find the full 51 min documentary

S√©rieux, c'est tellement exact ton commentaire, on dirait que je l'ai jamais exprim√© ainsi quand certains disaient "you see what we lost because of bill 101."
Tu croit ceux qui habitent Toronto profite de son economie?
>Les gens parlent de Montr√©al comme √©tant la capital financi√®re du Canada dans le temps. C'est clairement pas la population qui en profitait.
exactly this.
Extreme wealth inequality brings good architecture at least
We're back!
I enjoyed this poem, thanks for sharing
C'est pas Lord Worm qui √©tait sur cet album.
The top 1% own 25.6% of Canada‚Äôs wealth.
Top 1% au Canada c'est a peu pres 250K de revenu brut. Alors des m√©decins, les professionels les mieux pay√©s et de petits entrepreneurs. Pas les milliardaires que les gens imaginent...
Not really, but we're getting there. Unfortunately
The rich Canadians are now more scattered around the country.
Montreal and some affluent suburbs.
Toronto
Vancouver
Et anglophone.
Why even comment that
The quiet revolution has nothing to do with the referendum, FYI. Like 20 years apart.
Montreal was already on the decline after the war. A study showed that industries were already shifting towards Toronto in the 40's and 50's.  it accelerated when the Seaway was opened. But sure blame the french-canadiens.
des corps d'enfants...!
Yup!

sadly the NFB seems to have taken it off their website. It used to be free to view in its entirety. Some universities in Qc have it, but that's a hassle. I'd email the NFB to ask what's up
Avant que les orangistes ne br√ªlent le parlement
They have better average salaries that‚Äôs fir sure
Back then it did. Today's wealth inequality somehow just yields a bunch of philistines.
On rigole, mais il y a clairement une causalit√© entre le co√ªt de la main d'≈ìuvre et la qualit√© architecturale. Un immeuble ouvrag√© comme celui de la Sun Life serait impensable aujourd'hui.
Back again!
T'as tellement raison! merci, je corrige imm√©diatement!
Rookie numbers, Canada. Step it up if you wanna catch us in the US!
any idea about the worldwide stats?
Maybe he was inspecting the building ? That seems like an expensive drone used by companies.
There was a drone flying between the ghetto and the McGill sport center Wednesday morning, and it was operated by road workers.
Looked like that exact drone too.
I know it's probably not you but that big antenna make you look suspect hahaha
In the ghetto??
Walk up to the window. Naked.
Make eye contact with the camera.
Masturbate furiously.
That drone was going to a prison for a delivery
Better hope they had a drone license, Downtown is Class C airspace.
why you have windows ?
Do you have a slingshot?
Use it to take it down.
This is quite obviously a pro drone.
The world doesn't revolve around you, I'd bet money they gave no fucks and were doing building inspection.
This looks like a commercial drone with some kind of a special camera mounted on it ‚Äî maybe they‚Äôre doing thermal imaging of the building?
Drone this big definitely requires a licence and permit to fly at a given place and time. If you‚Äôre really curious, you can follow up with TCCA, they would have a record of this.
Says the guy with a drone remote...
I bet you'll find it on a certain hub in a couple day
I hope that footage makes its way here, that‚Äôd be fire tho
SouthPark vibes
[deleted]
This is so fucked. I hate drones.
Unofficial SPVM drone
Tell him I'd be more effective at night
Lorne Crescent?
That's a survey drone. Probably doing video for an upcoming construction project.  Possibly replacing the ghetto!!!
if you believe this is a drone incident worth reporting, you can do it here :
[https://tc.canada.ca/en/aviation/drone-safety/report-drone-incident](https://tc.canada.ca/en/aviation/drone-safety/report-drone-incident)
I'd show some slingshot skills üí™üèº
Man thats when you grab a slingshot with a ball full of oil to hit that fucker
Edit: apparently not cuz its operated by city workersüòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖ
I‚Äôd say we subventions ours - government paid 
And take out theirs
This happened to us in pierrefonds in the West Island someone had their drone passing by my windows. My windows are huge so it‚Äôs easy to see inside üò´
In the ''ghetto''..?  Wtf can you not
That‚Äôs illegal you can magbe report them?
I think that's illegal nowadays on downtown
Lmao paranoia much
That‚Äôs not impossible but he was apparently really going window to window, and we didn‚Äôt get any notice from the management about an inspection, so that makes me think it wasn‚Äôt that :/
No, this guy was ripping it around Roger's place a few weeks back and the police helicopter was over head. Can't tell where it's coming from. It can't be netted because it's always over a busy spot in the city. And the guy who's flying it is super crafty. He lowers it so the police go there, then up again and like 100m away and then it lowers for real.
This is border line city perv...
A few years ago a house inspector told me he wish he could use drones to inspect the roofs so he doesn‚Äôt need to climb up any more, but they won‚Äôt allow it. I‚Äôm not sure if for higher buildings the rule has been changed.
Hummm that would make sense, we‚Äôre right next to the sport Center and there has been road construction all week on Alymer, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs the same drone, thanks :)
Haha, i promise it‚Äôs just my girlfriend‚Äôs tape deck
What, why?
Mcgill Ghetto / Milton Park Neighbourhood.
Poor drone pilot that was hired to inspect the building lol.
FBI open up... lol
They did, it was authorized drone building inspection.
We can‚Äôt all live at the Palais de Justice
What are you apologizing for?
I hate that the term drone got so popular it took over.  They aren't drones, they're RC's.  But i'm also old and grumpy and no one cares about my opinions. :D
Care to expand why?
Hobbyist camera drones have had zero impact on my life.
The medical drones in remote Africa do bring me joy, that people can get medication and care even when they are in the middle of owhere. Fuck yeah, technology.
Quick on the trigger huh
You can do allot of cool stuff in research with drones. Don't hate the machine, hate the pilot. Don't let a few assholes ruin your opinion of an impressive piece of tech
It is legal with the proper permits. Big time illegal without said permits
it's a 10k+ drone, specifically a DJI Matrice 300 RTK [https://candrone.com/products/dji-matrice-300-rtk](https://candrone.com/products/dji-matrice-300-rtk?variant=32194206597201&currency=CAD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&matchtype=&network=g&device=c&adposition=&keyword=&campaign=794092989&adgroup=pla-18283950120&gclid=CjwKCAiAm7OMBhAQEiwArvGi3OXSHivQ28kJck-UFag_v5_PmI96gFvBJVXA7lCPRqUuld1N-eRomxoC1QwQAvD_BwE) Your everyday pervert won't have that, but instead something like a Mavic Mini for 1/15 the price.
&#x200B;
I expect it was a thermal sensing equipment, and he was looking at leaks around the windows. By the looks of it, it's a Zenmuse H20 [https://www.dji.com/ca/zenmuse-h20-series](https://www.dji.com/ca/zenmuse-h20-series)
&#x200B;
Edit : reduced URL size
Yeah going window to window, sounds like he's just working. Would have been nice for your building manager to give you a heads up
They literally had a car on the stret saying "Drone building inspection".
If you guys like this sort of thing, I have lots more I can post.  Any old Montreal-related logos that you guys particularly like?

These are great! A real throwback.
If you have more why not dump them on github!
A blast from the past my friend. I‚Äôm 40 and I grew up with every single one of these logos. Do more!

Someone else has been remaking them for the past 4 years, it was featured on Radio-Canada a while back (around 400+ vintage Quebec logos, from shops to Tv shows). Another started to make parodies of them as well. Keep up the good work!

All of them but Lafleur. (Though it..feels familiar. Where were they?) That old Eaton's Centre logo is bringing back amazing memories of visits to the mall with my parents as a kid. :')
This one is a long shot but how about the Cumberland pharmacy logo? (Everyone else suggested all my other suggestions, lol)
Tous!! Nice one :)
Damn that old MusiquePlus logo :')
Omg, I recognize all of them!!! I must feel very old!! Wow
It's a cool hobby!!!

All of them. A friend of mine used to collect ‚Äúbec‚Äùs. Any name logo that had a bec added to make it Que-bec centric. Great collection
The old lotto max logo it was called super 7 back then
This is super cool! Bringing back lots of memories. All familiar apart from the canal famille one...What about MovieLand? Not sure that was as big a thing for everyone else but we spent every Friday night there renting movies! I remember when I was at Concordia there was a prof who collected old signs, they were installed all over the Loyola campus...
Other iconic MTL signs:
- Super Sex on St Catherine 
- Mr Hot Dog 
- beauty‚Äôs
Some of these are only Montr√©al-related if you never left Montr√©al in the 80s/90s, but I suppose they're Montr√©al-related in that they were found there as well as elsewhere.

Funny as fuck.
Tu compren po c de lart modern /s juste au cas o√π.
Trouver des installations comme celle-ci un peu partout est l'une des raisons pourquoi j'aime tellement Montr√©al !

√áa fait tellement assimil√©.
Technically being on the west side of Atwater makes it St-Henri
Art is weird.
Oddly enough, this is just ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢
Un parc acote d'un bar sur notre dame
A la place ou le n√©on flash H/M-otel. Man that place always looked sketchy... Based on the neone sign only.
I've seen it just now.
C'est vrai que √ßa sonne assimil√© ! Mais ya eu un grand afflux d'immigrants anglophones il y a longtemps, notamment de communaut√©s noires antillaises, avant que le quartier prenne ce nom-l√†. Oscar Peterson et Oliver Jones, deux l√©gendes du jazz, viennent d'ailleurs de ce quartier. 
Ce n'est donc pas de l'assimilation selon moi, parce que la pr√©sence anglophone venait de la classe ouvri√®re pauvre, pas de la bourgeoisie. Pis je trouve √ßa juste normal de vouloir nommer ton quartier dans ta langue
Quelqu'une dans mon groupe de m√®res sur Facebook disait qu'elle √©tait √† 'Two Mountains'. En ville je comprends le bilinguisme mais au rive nord...
Justement, c'est √† l'est d'Atwater. √Ä c√¥t√© de la Drinkerie Ste-Cun√©gonde
That sign is east of Atwater, in the park just north of de Levis. The park is adjacent to Drinkerie st cunegonde. Near the edge of, but in petite bourgogne.
Art is anything if you are ready to call it art, someone took a dump right next to the toilet ? Eh, has some chaotic creativity, he probably aimed it there in purpose, the emotions he/she must have felt ... yup, it's art 
:')
Isn't that right next to Atwater market? Not really sketchy
Ah ce chic endroit avec la piscine vide?
Can‚Äôt believe someone spent a few thousand dollars on this billboard
Ouais, avant c'√©tait au sud du Esso Notre-Dame/Atwater. T'as raison!
This billboard has been up for over a year. They change the text every month of so, most time not very interesting. This is the first time it is funny/ makes any sense.
En effet, j'avais pas pens√© au fait qu'il avait chang√© de place... Petro-Can tho, non ?
Yep, correct again
Very cool
You got talent at drawing.
I'm gonna need a farine five roses bag for size.
very nice!
Cool drawing, well done.
But why the fuck is this a cultural landmark of Montreal? It‚Äôs just a decrepit, ugly ass building next to an equally decrepit and ugly port. Whole area sucks; I never saw the appeal of this region.
I miss the FLOUR part of the sign. As a resident of the south shore, I have seen this sign too many times to count. Well done.
Great painting, the rem is rly awful
Thank you
It is a controversial area indeed, as was the entirety of the Old Port for a time, but the silos are a vestige to Montreal‚Äôs history as one of the leading (if not the #1, second only to NYC) ports in North America, specializing in the export of grain. Generally, grain was transported by rail to Montreal, stored in the many silos/freight sheds in the port and then distributed to ships by marine towers. 
Farine Five Roses (previously Ogilvie) is now offices I believe, and there was a lot of backlash when they said they would not be ensuring the sign‚Äôs survival. Many Montrealers grew up with that sign, even if the words on it changed over time. It has reached iconic status, so I think people were happy when they eventually decided to keep the sign. Silos 1 and 2 that used to be in the port were demolished in the 80s I think, but Silo 5 is of course still there. The central part (Elevator B, the super rusted one) is unique because the silo bins are made of steel and are square, unlike the reinforced concrete cylinders you typically see on any other silo complex. So it has some serious historical value that you don‚Äôt see anywhere else.
Also these architectural ruins have a solemn grandeur about them. Sometimes eerie, certainly mysterious, accentuated by their proximity and reflection off the water. Difficult to pinpoint exactly what makes them so special to so many. Also it‚Äôs kinda nice to occasionally have something so different (dirty) sitting there. Sparkly clean neighbourhoods/areas often lack a real sense of character that can only be built over time. But that last part is just my opinion. Silo 5 in particular is recognized as a structure of historical value by the Federal Heritage Bureau but is not protected under any provincial status, and redevelopment projects for it have been up in the air for years. 
A long comment, yes, I‚Äôm just really into stuff like this
I mean ugly and decrepit is kind of what Montreal excels at. I love it here but it‚Äôs also a broken down dump.
That's the Bonaventure expressway.
The REM will run along the viaduct and embankment behind this perspective.
Thanks! I've always wondered this. When I just got here, I'd often make the trip to and from the Eastern Townships and Farine Five Roses was how I knew i was getting in the city!
They really fit the industrial/Brutalist aesthetic of Montr√©al.
I understand why people would think they're ugly, but for me they're just magical. I've spent lots of time and still do just hanging out in the parks in front of it and just looking at them, it's like being in a video game or movie, I'm expecting 90's Batman to be perched on it or something.
You‚Äôre right, damn i didnt reflect long enough. Thank you
Same here, I‚Äôm always looking up at the broken windows to see if there is anyone looking out (I‚Äôm expecting urbexers but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Batman made an appearance). So far no luck but maybe one day
Tellement une belle journ√©e! D'o√π vient la photo? Parc Angrignon?
Beautiful Morning/Day. This is why I don't mind the cold
j'ai pens√© qu'on √©tait d√©j√† termin√© √† cause de la rechauffement les derni√®rs jours, mais l√† je suis content de voir une autre belle couche de neige.
En v√©lo ce matin c'√©tait magique.
Belle journ√©e pour aller patiner !
It was so pretty late last night and very early this morning. It looks like icing sugar is sprinkled on the trees.
Oui la vue est assez manignifique! :) C‚Äôest au Parc Ferland √† Saint-L√©onard.
Beautiful day for a walk outside, honestly.
Avant paques c'est assez rare, a vrai dire. 
Mais une chance. J'aime pas trop le printemps boueteux.
√áa ressemble plus √† Pie XII je te dirais. Ferland n'a pas autant d'arbre.
C'est quoi l'id√©e de me downvoter, c'est impossible que ce soit Ferland, c'est le parc Pie XII du cot√© de Lavoisier. Regardez le nombre d'arbre c'est juste Pie XII qui ressemble √† une for√™t avec la caverne en dessous.
Regardez ensuite sur streetview et comparer on voit l'enseigne verte de la piste cyclable et le poteau qui a l'enseigne corridor scolaire et √† cot√© le derri√®re du panneau 30km/h.

C‚Äôest ma cousine qui m‚Äôavait dit que c‚Äô√©tait Ferland vu que la photo a √©t√© prise par elle, sinon c‚Äôest correct si c‚Äôest PI-9.. √ßa ne change pas que la vue √©tait magnfique aujourd‚Äôhui :)
Oui c'est Pie XII, ma belle-soeur habitait en face pendant 15 ans.
C'est parce que Pie XII est bois√© et les paysages hivernaux sont magnifiques donc dire que c'est Ferland c'est presque un crime.
Je ne suis pas le seul alors qui sait que c'est Pie XII.
Pour √™tre honn√™te, je suis √† STL depuis toujours et je n‚Äôai jamais mise les pieds √† Ferland ni √† PI-9 donc je ne connais pas la diff√©rence :P Mes parents habitent en face de Coubertin donc c‚Äô√©tait le seul Parc o√π j‚Äôallais et ou j‚Äôam√®ne mon fils maintenant
Je comprends, les 3 parcs sont assez proche l'un de l'autre sauf que les 3 ont des caract√©ristique bien diff√©rente dont Pie XII et son bois√© sans parl√© de la caverne qui s'y trouve aussi.
S√©riiieux y‚Äôa une caverne??? On dirai c‚Äôest moi qui vit dans une caverne.
Pie XII oui.  Tu pas vu la nouvelle de la d√©couverte qu'elle √©tait plus grande que pr√©vu il y a 2 ans ?

My old 'hood...  I miss that area so much
I grew up on Favard, right by Marguerite-Bourgeois park. 
Good times!
Nice! Almost looks like a painting..
Cool shot! Thanks for sharing!

I used to live around there too. It was only a short term rental but we lived in the neighborhood for almost 10 years. :)

looks like an oil painting, nice picture
Stunning!
looks like a painting!
Is it a good idea to take a picture from inside your house at the street? Aren't you afraid people will know where you live?
Salut voisin
Random I know mais tu habites vraiment a l'ile dorval? Comment √ßa va? J'ai toujours voulu savoir
Thats what I was thinking
I‚Äôm thinking about buying in the area. This or St. Henri
thanks!
Anyone reading this should feel free to knock on my door and come have a beer.

Non, mais je trouvais √ßa ben dr√¥le que les mods aient mis √ßa dans les choix, pis en plus, j'aimerais ben
It's gotten stupid expensive. Sold my condo on Centre, between Ropery and Island for way more than it's worth.
That's the attitude! Avec les restrictions, une bi√®re aux Sans Tavernes serait un meilleur choix, quand la terrasse va ouvrir
Salut trois voisins!
Someone I know bought a townhouse in psc recently for close to a million. I grew up in Sud-Ouest and remembers how rough and tumble the point used to be, property going for those prices doesn't sit right with my spirit.
Count me in!
Nice job. Ah Super Sex, I remember visiting in the 80's and that sign all lit up in it's glory.
Calforex sign almost says sexy!
Needs more orange cones.
Yo this is cool
Last time I was there the 'Five Guys' was a 'Nickels'
Looks like the cones are lining up for Super Sex
I'll always remember the last time I was on Ste.-Catherine.  The Super-sexe bouncer was on the sidewalk in front of  the club, promoting all the "Vagin mouill√©, Vagin poilue.  Vagin souill√©, Vagin qui pue", Cheech Marin-style from From Dusk 'Til Dawn, in mid afternoon, with little kids walking about.
Got taken to the buffet for lunch at super sex a few times ...very odd experience lol
I was walking behind a couple who had a young girl with them and she asked "Is that a Barbie store? Can we go in? " 
I love your work and admire your talent.
Ah yes... the hot & cold buffet...  * wicked art btw.
Nice! Do you sell your work?
J'ai un souvenir particulier de l'enseigne du Super Sexe. Quand il y a eu la crise du verglas j'√©tais
Es messager √† pied dans le centee-ville, et tous les commerces sur Ste-Catherine ont ferm√© leur enseignes et leurs lumi√®re et le centre-ville √©tait noir, tous sauf un seul, le Super Sexe. Le contraste √©tait tellement fort qu'on la voyait presque jusqu'√† St-Laurent.
Apparently Super Sexe used to have a great breakfast buffet. That‚Äôs what my cousin told me when he lived here.
This series might make a great book someday!
Nice one avec les c√¥nes!
Amazing! The Five Guys used to be a cinema, le Palais I think
Ahh SuperSex where I used to dream of going when I was a hormonal 13 year old and never bothered as al adult!
Is the Five Guys still open?
Mi gusta!  My Tuesday lunch spot after drawing class
Nothing left of the fun Montreal.
haha ofc the three orange construction cones had to be in it, well done! :)
Celebrated my 18th birthday next door at "Super Danse Contact" just about 18 years ago... Oh god.
Well anyway, nice painting! You nailed the cones!
I read that Super Sexe closed in 2017 and the building owner wanted to take down the sign but Historical group in Montreal wanted to keep it as a landmark. Does anyone know how/why the sign stayed up?
Tried to go on christmas 4 years ago but it was closed. Went to kingdom instead.
I believe/think/hope that's intentional! Mildly amusing juxtaposition between subliminal advertising, below, and the overt, overtop.
Came here to say this.
thanks!
I believe that the Nickels was to the right of the Five Guys.
Lolll
also thank you!
THANKS!
Wow maybe!
Merci !
Le Palace!!! trop de bon souvenirs d'une ado paum√©e. On payait pour un film pis on allait en voir un 2e en cachette.
So many hours spent there as a kid.
r/nostalgia, mais serieusement j'ai tellement vu de film au Palace et √ßa m'attriste qu'il n'y ait plus rien de semblable. Coupl√© √† l'arcade qui √©tait √† cot√©, o√π il y a le Piranha Bar maintenant, a √©t√© deux sources de bonnes soir√©es pendant mon adolescence.
Lol thanks! The cones are so emblematic of the entire downtown.
i was there for my 21st bday, which was last march lol.
Yeah, I went back up to Montreal 3 years ago and it was closed. I heard from a dancer at another club due to a lawsuit or something but who knows.
oof tell me about it! i went there monday... and i remembered why i‚Äôm never around that area
It's open again? Well, was open again? Not sure of Covid restrictions up there.
Probably some shady business because the club was

That sounds like such an adorable idea. I hope a fellow teacher responds!
Interested! I teach grade 5!
u/boony pourrait voir si √ßa int√©resse le prof d'anglais √† ton √©cole!
Bonjour,
Je suis enseignante en 6e ann√©e, int√©ress√©e si vous cherchez toujours un groupe avec qui correspondre.
Hello! I‚Äôm not a teacher but my son will be in 5th grade this year, in an English intensive course‚Ä¶ i can ask his teacher if it‚Äôs a project she would be interested in‚Ä¶ school starts in 2 weeks ! Let me know if I should pursue further (school in the Montreal suburbs)
I teach grade 5 French at a small school just outside Montreal! Send me a message if you are still looking!
I don't know if that would still work, but when I was a kid we'd send letters addressed to "Anyone, Anywhere in Australia" or "Any grade X high school in Montana" or something and let the postal service take care of it - which they often would providing the postage was enough. Adds a little randomness too.
I went to a french immersion school in Ontario and we had penpals in Chicoutimi.  We did an exchange where they came and stayed with our families for a week then we went there.  My french improved significantly after the exchange.
Would you reach out directly to schools? I can PM you with the names of some schools that might be interested
Super id√©e! J'ai une classe de 4e ann√©e si vous ne trouvez pas preneur! :)
would it be okay if the teacher is a michigan fan?
What an amazing idea! If I still had a classroom of my own, I would have LOVED to participate!
Hi! I teach 2nd grade in French but I will ask the English teacher if she'd be interested! I can also ask my 4th grade colleagues. I will let you know!
Check out r/Qu√©bec too!
have you ever tried contacting the csdm, theres also the emsb if you want students that might be more anglophone aswell
Pm'd you
This is amazing!!! Hope you find great candidates! :)
I just want to see the exchange letters ‚ò∫Ô∏è this is gonna be so cute ‚ò∫Ô∏è
This is extremely wholesome.
It would be cool if anglo/french kids living in Montreal were allowed to participate in language exchange programs across school boards. French kids are prohibited by law from registering in English schools though :(
√âcole kenwood!
isnt it "e-mail pals" in 2021 ?
or do people still write(by hand) actual paper letters to each other like we used to do in the 80s ?
[removed]
Thanks.  Me too!
Excellent.  I will message you soon!
Merci beaucoup.  Je vais vous envoyer une message directe ce soir!
Same for my daugther
Thank you  (and /u/MitchAubin too!) for the offer.  If I'm not able to connect directly to a teacher here, I will follow up with you.  I appreciate your offer!
I will follow up this evening.  Merci!
That's kind of how the US Postal System has been working lately, except the opposite.  You send something to a specific person and it ends up with "Anyone, Anywhere, Eventually".  Great idea, though.  I love the randomness.
I think making a real, live connection like this can be a great motivator for students.  They won't be "writing" a "letter" to a "friend" that I just read and give them a grade on.  (Boring!)  I always found meeting people who speak the target language to be much more compelling that doing activities from a text book.
I'm hoping to connect directly to teachers, if possible.  I've gotten some good responses so far, but I may reach out to you if they don't pan out.  Thanks for the offer!
Je vais vous envoyer une message directe.  Merci!
Bottom of the pile!  (Just kidding.  Absolutely!)
I'd like to focus on Montreal for now, mostly because I have visited several times, but I will keep Qu√©bec in mind as well.  Merci!
I may try that if I can't find a teacher directly.  Merci!
Thank you!  I will follow up this evening!
Thank you!  Lots of good responses already!
Me too.  We'll give the kids some guidance, but it will also be interesting to see what they come up with on their own.  "Do you play Minecraft?  No way!  Me too!!"
Probably?  And I'd be open to that.  But there's also some value in writing by hand.  Plus, it's hard to match the thrill of receiving a paper letter.  I'm inclined to go old school, at least in part, but I'd be open to a digital component as well.
as a teaching tool writing by hand is best as far as I know.
It's like postcards. Sure you can take photos and put them on Facebook, but a postcard is something tangible you can hold, something more personal. I think today's children also have had enough screens as it is with Covid.
Most kids are already familiar with email but some may never have used the postal system, which is still a very useful tool in today's world : most gov communication comes by mail before anything else, and learning how to address a letter/package is an interesting lesson. They may also learn about the epistolary style or novel and many other things. History affects the present.
Sure letters have vastly been replaced by email, but I see much more letters than, say, fax, which was meant to replace it.
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind.  Merci pour vos conseils!
Super !

My parents took me and my penpal to Canada's Wonderland, definitely not boring!
Sounds like your class needs to start saving and fundraising for a trip to Montreal at the end of the year.
You should try asking in r/Quebec as well. Plenty of French speakers living outside Montr√©al too.
Kids love receiving actual mail. Think it a cool idea. Also more petsonel to see the actual hand writing. Great idea!üëç
yeah.. i guess i forgot the feeling after all these years of LOL's and IDK MY BFF JILL.
I hope getting a kid will bring me back there!
Got on a bus outside a train station in Oslo, Norway and asked the driver if he would let me know when we got to the stop closest to the address I gave him. He cheerfully agreed. As we approached the stop he let me know it was coming up, then said, "Hang on, I'll just take you there." He then drove to the address dropped off me and my girlfriend (at the time), and resumed his route.
That was over 30 years ago, and I'll always love Oslo because of it.
Im not really sure why people are trying to defend the bus driver. Its pretty common in most other cities for the bus driver to be able to confirm their own bus route, and even help direct you to the proper bus if needed. Especially on an airplane route. I get that hes not a tour guide, but this is just some basic human decency. Just because youre not obligated to help someone doesnt mean you have to go out of your way to be a dick.
OP, I was getting ready for a feel-good story about an STM employee, so I could pass this story on to my great-grandchildren, and they could ask incredulously, ‚ÄúReally, great-grandpop, there was a nice driver once?‚Äù
I was a regular of the 747 for almost a year, 90% of the drivers had soul crushing attitudes.
When you hate your work that much, you find something else.
It‚Äôs not just the 747. A few years ago, I witnessed a few tourists asked the 61 driver if the bus went to old Montreal, which it does but the driver answered no.  
I understand that drivers are not tour guides but they can still confirm their route. Even as a local, sometimes I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm taking the bus in the right direction and I‚Äôll ask the driver if they are headed a certain way.
You should file a complaint to the STM.
I witnessed a bus driver berating a passenger for not speaking French. It was on C√¥te-de-Liesse at one of the stops facing a hotel, the passenger asked if the bus was going to a metro and the bus driver replied "metro du coll√®ge". The passenger didn't understand what that meant and they went back and forth several times repeating the same thing and not understanding each other, eventually the bus driver yelled at him "Do you speak French? We are in Quebec here and we speak French here". The driver could've simply answered "Yes, this bus goes to a metro" at any time but instead the tourist/traveller had to go through a really unpleasant interaction. 
I filed a complaint to the STM and got a call back a few weeks later to go over the incident in greater detail. Not sure what resulted from it but I think it's something that should be logged. There's a mixed bag of bus drivers and some just shouldn't be on routes where you'll find a lot of tourists.
"Chu syndiqu√© mo√© tabarnak! Spa dans ma convention d'faire le guide touristique!"
\- Un chauffeur de la STM
I used to take the 747 whenever I arrived into the city until I finally caved and took uBer. No offense, but the 747 is not exactly the best brand ambassador for Montreal.
[deleted]
When I was in CEGEP I took a bus driver to see his manager with me because I had asked him a question about the route and different time schedules and he had literally replied to me to look at the pancarte, in a very rude way. I told him I looked at the pancarte and still couldn't get an answer to my question, I was only asking for help. What a douche. They all seem so sick of life. Not gonna start on certain tellers in the metro.
Many STM employees are incredibly unhelpful and rude, despite most of them making over $100k/year. The bus drivers easily make this with the overtime they do. I've seen similar rude behaviour even to locals.
As a Montrealer myself I cannot wait for the REM train to start working out if the airport! Metro is not bad but I always avoid the buses.
[deleted]
[deleted]
Not even a stupid question, since both Toronto and Cambridge have 'Avenue Road'.
I got on a 747 at 4am to make it for my flight at 6am. Had a $5 bill and coins and the driver refused to let me on as the machine did not accept $bills. A kind stranger offered me coins. Made it to the airport in time.
Our transportation infrastructure and staff could really be abysmal in some aspects.
For example, the electronic indicators for buses and bus stops. In Seoul, more than 10 years ago, they already had super reliable real-time indicators in all buses and at all stops. Fine, it's Seoul, I thought, but a few years later in a small town in Germany, they had something similar, just less fancy. When STM finally installed those indicators in buses, I was beyond elated. Then... very soon, some indicators stopped functioning, there's no sound, and some totally went blank. Some drivers couldn't give an eff about informing passengers where they're at even when asked. Worse, some didn't even bother to refresh the signs at the front of the bus, and was offended when you tried to verify it with them. If there's a major detour (due to snail-paced road repairs all over the city), some drivers don't find the need to inform the passengers.
To be fair, some drivers are quite courteous, but some don't even bother looking you in the eyes, let alone greeting you or giving a nod. I know it's perhaps asking too much to be like Tokyoites, but surely we can aim to be half as good?
The facilities - elevators, escalators, etc - at some major metro stations are out of service 1/3 of the time. Like, is it too hard to get the basics right? When I was in a small city in Austria, there's nothing fancy at their stations, but all the basics run well and are well-maintained.
Sure, there are no pickpockets roaming around like in Rome or Athens, and metro stations are cleaner than some of those in the States, that's perhaps one of the only few things to be grateful for...
Travailler avec le public, c'est tr√®s difficile. Il y a tout et n'importe qui dans les bus de Montr√©al. C'est comme √™tre caissi√®re chez Wal-Mart. Fais √ßa pendant 2-3 ans, pis ton amour pour l'humanit√© en prend pour son rhume. 
*Source* : TOUS les thread r/AskReddit sur le sujet "working with the public"
Extraits du [premier que j'ai trouv√©](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/nyi4vf/what_do_you_hate_most_about_working_with_the/) en cherchant avec la loupe :
1. Honestly, so many people are great to work and deal with. I get pleasure out of helping people. But then you've got the arse holes that just want to ruin your day. I've moved away from customer service now. I refuse to go back for my mental health's sake.
2. Oh god where do I even start. People man, they are so closed minded, rude and fail to empathize with people who might be different than them. Society is very toxic and as a pizza delivery guy, I deal with it lot.
3. I feel you guys! I am veteran grocer miself, and today i almost fucking quit, i cannot deal with these morons anymore... Should i quit for the sake my mental state? I feel like my brain is rotting away every hour behind the register.
The only time someone has refused to meet me halfway language wise has been on a 747 bus, the first one I got on going to the airport with a the wrong bill to pay for the ticket instead of a ticket, I wonder if it's the same driver.
> Now, listen, I get it. You hate life and everything in it. That's a job requirement of working for the STM
lol my friend work as a driver for the STM and he's one of the friendliest person i know.
Never really understood the whole thing of hating someone cause they don‚Äôt speak French.. so stupid
Something is really wrong in Montr√©al right now generally speaking, a bad vibe has settled. Shootings, stabbings, assaults, it just doesn't end.
I've been here 2 days, never had been, and don't love its bus drivers honestly. These folks could not give less fucks.
I remember getting on the 747 at the airport, put my suitcase in the tray sat down and put my little backpack between my legs.
Few minutes later, the doors close and the driver goes "pas de depart avant que les valises ne soient a leur place". And he repeats that several times with increasing anger, never looking at me or indicating in any way that he was not down with my backpack. I was 4ft away from him.
You're dealing with people who have been travelling for many hours, who probably don't even speak french ... and you're being a dick about it?
Last time I took the 747. From there on it's been Car2go or uber.
Fuck you, buddy. Fuck you STM.
Simply put he doesn't have to help her but he could and decides not to. It's not if he should have or shouldn't have, it's more of a question of one's moral fiber. It saddens me a bit that others aren't willing to help when they are in a position to do so. Put yourself in her shoes.
It might not sound great as an answer, but it's a good indication of the bureaucratic life in Qu√©bec.
I was planning to go to Mon Royal park last Sunday to see the live music. The 11/711 bus route was re routed. Waited for 1 huyr before some girl told me the stop had changed to somewhere else. Walked there, got on bus. One couple US as well were in the same boat. They asked why are you not going on mountain. That mf driver mislead them by saying take 165, it will take you mountain. I followed tej couple. But the 165 was no where.near going top.of mountain.
I asked the couple "you sure bro"?. We asked the driver. He was mad yelling at us. "I don't go on the fucking mountain, do you speak any French? Get out and take steps". we were flustered. One old lady explained us on how to get their. 
It was fun. FML.
Every once in a while I'll come across a nice STM worker.... but it's rare. Most of them are the complete worst Montreal has to offer. 
Metro booth workers are quite possibly the worst though. They will grunt and point to the automatic card machines and refuse to answer questions while they hide in their hut.
Stm as a whole has me disgusted. 
I work at the supervised injection site and my shift usually ends at 2:00 am.
At least once a week there‚Äôs no service on the 350 line to Verdun. I‚Äôve had to walk from east downtown to Atwater staying on the bus path in case it was late. Usually it comes near berri at around 2:40. That day when i got to Atwater and spoke to a stm guy who called the dispatch center then he simply told me that they had 3 departures canceled that night and there was no way for us to know when that happen.
I immediately complained on Twitter @stm_info and their reply was that all buses were running and gave me a link to contact stm. To what they answer that there is nothing they can do to help.
So now i know that at least once a week i‚Äôll be getting home at almost 5am.
It feels great to pay for a service that is unreliable like that.
>So, yeah, STM guy, thanks for making a tourist on an airport bus route make her first experience in Montr√©al (and probably Qu√©bec in general) an unpleasant one. Classy.
On the bright side you turned that around completely and the tourist can now say "people are so friendly/helpful in Quebec!"
Your actions today put us all in a good light, thank you OP.
I love your city, but everyone who works at your airport is frankly despicable.
Downloading an offline map works wonders and doing a bit of research before traveling. As someone who has travelled all over the world I actually find MTL to be a great city. The one time I had to take the 747 I mispronounced Guy and not only did the driver not make fun of it he announced when my stop was coming up. I really think it‚Äôs a two-way street and people start with attitude as soon as they come here where it‚Äôs like they have poor expectations and do what they can to fulfill those.
Once had a 747 driver ask me where I was headed and because I was the only passenger left, he dropped me off straight at my destination. Such an awesome guy ü•≤
It's rare you find a decent stm driver.  I think it has to do with working with the public too long
STM bus drivers are super unhelpful lol
Every time I've asked a driver about a stop on the route, they didn't have a clue how to answer and were frequently rude on top of that. One would be bad enough without the other. But also how do you do the job if you have no fucking clue where you're going?
Oh you say it so well!!! What a Nuckle head
And so true about stm bus drivers it is definitely a prerequisite to be completely miserable. 
Thanks for the laugh üòÇ
OK, but...
Look -- maybe the bus driver was really an asshole, he wouldn't be the first or the last.
Or maybe, just MAYBE, depending on how the person pronounced the word "Rue", the bus driver didn't spot that she was confused. And if the bus driver doesn't know every single street in the city (which, who tf does?), how does he know there isn't a street called "Rue"? Montreal is a big place; for all the driver knows there is indeed a street somewhere called "Rew", or "Roo", or even "Rue"....
Besides, maybe the driver isn't so fluent in English. Like, maybe he understands it but he isn't comfortbale enough to give directions or discuss elaborate things. Maybe "no" is all he can think to say if someone asks him, "Does the bus stop at this place." and the bus doesn't.
For fuck's sake, this kind of thing happens all the time, it's not because people are rude or unhelpful or jerks. It's because languages are difficult. It's a part of life.
Good job, OP!  I frequently travel solo and although I always learn a few essential words in the local language, there are times you need help from a friendly local. For me, friendliness and willingness to help (or lack thereof) leaves perhaps the most lasting impression of a city.
Montreal isn‚Äôt the friendliest city in Canada
STM driver are all trash
You can report it to the STM, they care. I personally wouldnt though
C'est pas unique a Montreal,  les chaffeurs de bus √† travers le monde on des airs d'envis d'chier, √ßa vient avec la job j'imagine. Autant que possible j'essaie d'√©viter l'autobus.
Can't say I'm suprised that a francophone didn't equate the word STREET with Ste, which in his mind is Sainte anyhow. It's not even the English abbreviation. She needed to add in the key word of Catherine. Rue Street Catherine would prob have helped a lot.
I mean, he could have been nicer, but....
Je suis pas chauffeur, mais j'ai une tonne d'amis qu'ils le sont et les gars ont pas le temps, c'est pas des GPS, si y fait une faveur c'est nice mais les chauffeurs (ou chauffeuses) ont pas d'obligation √† aider tout le monde √† donner des directions.
J't'all√© √† Vancouver √ßa fait quelques mois de √ßa, tu sais combien de fois j'ai ask le chemin √† quelqu'un? Litt√©ralement zero. Je me suis pas perdu une seule fois. Toute les infos sont sur maps et y as le wifi for free dans l'a√©roport.
Pi pourquoi tu l'as pas aider alors? Parce que t'as bug sur le moment? Qui te dit que lui aussi y as pas bug sur le moment? Peut √™tre qu'y a eu un texto qui lui a dit que son fils est encore retourn√© en urgence √† Louis-H. Peut √™tre que sa femme l'a laiss√© pour son ami d'enfance et y a catch √ßa ce matin.
Toi t'as le droit de rien dire parce que tu te sentais mal √† l'aise mais monsieur le chauffeur connait pas 'Rue Street' et c'est lui le wack?
Ah yo, va dormir toi.
C'est pas le travail du chauffeur de jouer les google maps. 
Le temps qu il lui fasse repeter, qu'il explique le probl√®me etc. le bus prend du retard et des gens peuvent etre en retard / rater l avion etc.
En plus si il doit le faire en anglais, c'est une barri√®re en plus.

How she was able to make it this far in life is the real question. Has she never hear of Google Map?

Pretty on brand for redditors to complain about this and then go into the next STM thread and cry about their bus not being on time. 
He's a bus driver not a tour guide.

Dude... it's still nice and quiet here. Keep it on the down-low before some douches start having raves and shootings.
Ahh I remember those days of somebody getting stabbed behind the dunking doughnuts, now rent is 1200$ a month
bright sunny weatherüòç
Verdun mostly build out in 1920's and 1950's, anyone know how all that waterfront green space south side of Lasalle blvd survived?  Any other city that would now be houses or condo towers.
LOVE secret hideaway places :)
This bring back good memories of when I used to live in Verdun years ago as a student.  The bike path and parks along the river is such a great feature of the neighborhood.  * *sigh nostalgia* *
Looks like it could be a Monet!
So this is where the Angel of Verdun got her name.
Your next victim? Lol
*intensify heavy breathing*
I know exactly where that is.  Used to walk my dog down that path when i was living in Verdun.  Miss the area.  The walking area that is, not Verdun.
Great vantage point to watch the bodies float by.
it's already happening, since the beach opened it's full of douchebags and loud obnoxious people.
I actually have no problem with PART of the park being that kind of party area, as long as the choice exists to go elsewhere. It's a huge park.
For example, that shelter near the Douglas where they do square dancing, well maybe they can also have some industrial nights too ;)
They are already burning down the waterfront with fireworks. Have you not noticed all the patches missing of fragmites? People are also tearing them down. There are so many massive scorched sections. People are terrible.
I can see that happening, old port is already compromised :(
We've been throwing raves in Verdun for 10+ years..  plz, you've just never been invited ;)
A dude was stabbed to death a few blocks west of the dunking donuts in February.
If you look at topographic maps over the years, you will see that that green space didn't exist in the years you mentionned. All that green space is actually backfill (concrete, asphalt, various debris, snow dumping, etc.) accumulated in later years. Such backfill is generally unsuitable for construction. Many parks in Montreal/Laval used to be ancient quarries that were also backfilled in a similar manner. There are 2 bike paths along the green space, the northern one (nearest to the street used to be along the river. You can  see the lamp posts along the path that used to be barriers to prevent cyclists falling in the river.
Back in the 20s the river had a boardwalk, it's still there, sort of. The river used to come all the way up to the Natatorium. This boardwalk was built on a levy that was built earlier to protect Verdun from the annual spring floods (Verdun still has an occiasonal flooding problem). 
Down by the water in the 50s, like at arthur Therrien park it was literally a dump. They covered it with land from the metro a construction which extended the embankment considerably.
So the river was always a greenspace that has only expanded with time.
Extra note: the land in front of the 17th century farmhouse near the Douglas on the river, there are hundreds of spots where old native camp fires we're discovered. That spot was a staging ground to portage around the rapids.
POV: you're the Zodiac killer on the prowl
I have no idea who this person is, but I hope this picture finds them. It was taken yesterday, June 6th at 14:28. Coordinates: 45.466, -73.560.
Bodies of what... branches?
The beach hasn't opened, the fences are pushed down and it is swim at your own risk.
When the beach officially opens it'll be crowd control and rules again such as but not limited to no smoking on the beach.
I could agree with that as long as it was in a controlled and well-organized enviroment.
That's actually done by the firefighters in a controlled manner... you should look things up before speaking out of your ass. ‚úå
I'll add that the backfill was made on purpose, it was a plan by the city in the very early 1900 to prevent the city to be flooded every spring.
This always interested me so much when I lived in Verdun. You can still see lots of old signs of how built up the waterfront used to be, faded yellow lines over paved road barely peaking out of the dirt and bushes, random worn down chunks of concrete foundation jutting into the water. Super cool!
For a second there it looked like you didn't know who Zodiac was but you hoped they would get the picture... 
[And it just sounded like a bad idea...](https://i.gyazo.com/49940e9d8eb704dcdaa599c51186a3bf.png)
I hate people who take pictures of unsuspecting people and then profit from it while never bothering to let the person who was photographed know. That moment wasn't yours, it was theirs. Creepy.
Edit: Ok, story time! I was traveling with a photographer friend, and we were in the metro of a major European city. She takes a random picture of the train coming into the station. One guy comes up to her and asks her to delete the picture. She said "I didn't take a picture of you", he said "you took a picture with your camera directly pointing at me". See, to her she hadn't taken a picture of that guy, but that guy was still at the center of her picture. She tried to argue but seriously, she didn't have a leg to stand on - kinda like OP. Photographers can be very selfish and oblivious for the sake of "a good picture".
I guess you would have had to have grown up in verdump to understand.
I meant since it opened a summer or two ago
Sorry if it comes off as creepy. I just thought it looked nice having a sole person in the shot, I feels it adds to the picture. The person is quite unrecognizable so I don't think it's too harmful. Also I'm not profiting off this, just thought I'd share a nice picture.
With all due respect, chill out. It's just an innocent damn photo in a public space.
People are photographed unsuspected all the time. What are you on about? You can't even see the person's face.
I guess you haven't been to Verdun since then because that hasn't been the case in a while.
Ah. Well, it's a beach on the island of montreal. You can't really have high expectations of people.
I get your point I just don't agree. If I'd find out someone took a picture of me - even if it's distant - and I come across it, I'd be creeped  out. And you are profiting, just not financially.
Agreed. Besides, when you're out of your residence, you have no expectation of privacy. So that means it's fair game for a photographer to take a picture. He is not hurting her in any way, shape or form.
That's your opinion, I can have mine
There's a difference between appearing in a photo and being the  subject of one.
Happy to hear that the Hospital upstream has improved their swimming program.
I'd say she's actually more in the category of "appearing in a picture" then being a "subject of one".. the canopy and path way leading to the water were the subject for me. The person being there doesn't draw my attention. It's all perspective, part of the art.
Not sure why you‚Äôre downvoted - I thought it was pretty funny. .. upvote in protest
I guess you had to be there...
Belle photo!
I‚Äôm moving to this area in a few weeks, this just made me even more excited

The metros have DEFINITELY gotten sketchier. Every time I head to/from work now, some dumb shit goes down. Yesterday night (11:30 PM, Station Mont Royal) some dude was destroying a turnstile by kicking it, no mask, screaming in people's faces as they walked by. Two tired STM workers were quietly filming it for the cops, looking like it was the 7th time it happened that day. Wonder what it's gonna be tn.
This is so anxiety-inducing. The pandemic is of course absolutely horrifying, but idiots give us a lot of anxiety indeed.
Idiots who not only didn't cover their mouths, but sneezed/coughed like they're singing opera. That's pre-pandemic, now they do the same and also experiment with ways to wear a mask incorrectly. Idiotic young, seemingly healthy, men shamelessly jostling for a seat. Idiots who think their voluminous hairs, bags and fur-lined hoods defy physics and don't take up space (who doesn't like a hair breakfast? they'll flap it multiple times to make sure you're fully fed). Idiots who want you to think they're cool because they're listening to loud, phat beats. Idiots who want to make sure you get to hear every single detail of their private lives because they would later come up in the quiz of life.
Then, just when you thought you could finally breathe a little... you found that the escalator's out of service (the case for half of the time). And on the way to your office, you put yourself at risk because idiotic construction managers don't bother about the safety of passers-by. You also wonder why the same stretch of road took more than 3 years to repair. Then upon reaching your office, you're greeted by someone lecturing about what a transcendental human experience it is to contribute to a company.
Ok, I'll stop here and curl up and cry in the corner.
I for onw wish really hard my company decides to stay on a remote work basis, been home since March last year and it's great.
Pour vrai j'ai vu du monde au parc laurier a soir f√™t√©e un anniversaires pis drop une vingtaine de baloune dans les air comme si la pollution plastique c'√©tais un truc du fucking future.
>People are fucking stupid.
And this is why my friend the pandemic is still not over.
If you think it's over people are in for a bad awakening.
What kinda bubble are yall livin in? People have always been stupid.
I miss the fucking people not zooming off the highway near my place at 11pm.
Downtown was so peaceful for the last 6months
I've never seen so much shitty driving as I have these last few weeks.
And lack of respect for sharing space with other people.
I miss the empty streets the most. I hate cars with a passion and it was such a nice time when for a couple of weeks, no one went anywhere.
i'm retaining as much of the hermit style as i can
i love that the metro is there and try to avoid using it where possible. it's comforting to know i can be at work in 20 minutes but not going at all is better
what sucks about being cooped up is not the not going out it's the *inability* to go out
I'm working from home permanently.  I do NOT miss riding that metro during rush hour.
J'ai pris le m√©tro aujourd'hui. Et √ßa m'a saut√© aux yeux : depuis le "d√©confinement" le m√©tro est rendu glauque. La jungle d'utilisateurs est rendu wild. J'assiste √† des engeulades, des bousculades (encore aujourd'hui), du monde qui savent juste crier quand sont en groupe, des anti masques trop contents de montrer qu'ils sont "woke" des pr√©dicateurs, des itin√©rants turbulents, on se croirait √† New York!
This guy is right but it‚Äôs like this everywhere and not just the metro or Montreal. Have you driven lately? Everyone tailgates you regardless of your speed or if you‚Äôre in the right lane.
People are obsessed with their phones. I miss the days when it was just people talking on their phones. Now it‚Äôs texting, Facebook, IG, etc. No one signals and 95% of Quebec drivers have zero ability to anticipate red lights or minor traffic.
Oh, I think people have lost some of their socialization during the pandemic, so now we‚Äôre all slightly more sociopathic assholes. I wonder whether we‚Äôll come back, or degenerate further.
>Of course I don't miss all the death and depression and bankruptcy
Hang in there buddy. It's coming.
...it‚Äôs not even over yet. People are just pretending it is because vaccines have been rolling out.
Anyone else feeling more anti-social than before the pandemic?
I used to meet with people pretty often, professionnally and socially. 
Now that it's slowly getting back to normal, I rarely feel like either professionnal coffee meetings or social meetings. 
I still like to talk with people, I just can't be bothered to make too much of an effort to see them.
I bet rush hour is still far from peak affluence probably gonna get worse in fall with schools and more return from WFH in offices
I loved taking the metro during the pandemic.
I loved riding my bike downtown during the pandemic.
Now, there's just too many people again.
What about fuck that shit lol.
Covid was the worst year of my life and it can fuck right off.
Absolutely! I‚Äôve been taking public transit(mostly subway) for 20 years and I don‚Äôt know what happened but there is definitely a shift. In general everyone is good but since January every time I travel there is always 1 or 2 that just don‚Äôt get how the courtesy works and it‚Äôs getting worse.
I agree as the deaths, infections, businesses affected, etc. were no fun for anyone but it did give people a new way to live or think of life. Especially last year, when everything was closed for two weeks, it was as if everyone‚Äôs lives were put on pause. There were (and still are) pros and cons.
Sa fait 1 ans que jai pas sentie une mauvaise haleine et depuis qu‚Äôont est passer au Vert sa devient hardcore
There is nothing I wish more than to put this pandemic behind me. I'll take whatever shitty experience we submit ourselves to in the metros than another day of misery because of goddamn COVID
People forget how to drive every time snow hits the roads, so... Yeah...
--> r/unpopularopinion üëç
Saaaammme omg I don't know who I can talk to about this!!! Reddit can be hit or miss and decently you can't voice that opinion irl
There was a couple months when the Metro was near perfect. It was kept clean and wasn't crowded. I can understand the fact that there's going to be more people, but they seemed to have given up on keeping it clean. I've seen the same seat over multiple days with a random stain on it. Probably coffee, but who knows.
I‚Äôve been living in Montreal for years and was using the metro everyday, I‚Äôve got used to confort when working from home to the point that I went fuck it and bought a car when I got forced to come back to work.
Less stress, more comfort, I save time on my commute, I don‚Äôt have to deal with idiots, and wearing the mask for a prolonged time tend to give me panic attack especially in high humidity.
ya i'm job searching and all the work from home offers are gone, its all office or current WFH with return to work soon.
i dont want to work in the office waste 2 hours a day commuting, in person meetings, being bothered by small talk ect.
feels like people realized WFH is better but, offices want you back anyways.
&#x200B;
i still remember going to st-cathrine in april 2020 and it being empty with multiple parking spots, never will see that again.
The general public has high levels of stupidity and annoying behaviour. Covid demonstrated that. Hard to deal with people like that
Don't worry, total lockdowns will return. Always a new variant when old subsides.
Will never end, a bit of reprieve in summer just to lock us down come winter. 
Other countries do just fine with no lockdowns or mandates of any sort.
J'ai vu un collant sur un camion benne qui m'a bien marqu√© :

"j'suis vaccin√©, c'est correct!"
I'm in the process of moving out of the city. this whole thing triggered some really bad anxiety in me, whenever I'm in a crowd of more than 5 people I get paralyzed and melt down.  
This whole thing brought the worse out of people, I feel like we live in a zoo now.
Don't worry, it'll be back.
Agreed with this. The beginning of the pandemic was horrible for me. However, I have gotten used to the peaceful life of not dealing with people. I only got to deal with people I really wanted to see. One year of the pandemic made me realize that most of my stress was coming from‚Ä¶.other people (not only public transportation, but also work wise, forced social interaction, etc) Hell is other people as they say.
''L'enfer, c'est les autres.''  
J-P Sartre
On the roads it's just as bad.  I have never seen so many people looking down, presumably at a phone, completely oblivious to what's going on around them.  When I am never to them, I lay on the horn and they look up like "what?".  
Invest in a good front and back dashcam if you're going back to commuting everyday.
Also a thing that bothers me is people willing to yell over the phone or sharing personal matter with someone else so that it is a matter of everyone else within the wagon or the whole stm bus.
I like Covid shutdown because it made me feel more inclined to learn stuff there was nothing else to do.
The peace and quiet while living in the city was nice. Similarly the lack of noise from douche mobiles was nice.
the society is pushing people to become more and more 'individualistic' ‚Ä¶.which in my terms is called being a goddamn selfish a-hole.
What happened üòÇ
Miss COVID?
La Peste by Camus is JUST THE BOOK FOR YOU! *slaps cover* this one here will ensure you understand that there is always a plague from now on for ever and always! 
!!! Act now and get Epidemic (1987) for FREE !!!
I was also thinking of this at the Pharmacy, when I went to pick up a scrip at the counter. COVID made it easier because they were doing more deliveries, which meant fewer people waiting. I live right near so I don't need delivery and don't have serious risk factors and I'm not old. They also changed the practice of paying, so you could only get scrips and OTC, nothing else, which was also great- no more people with their carts piled high, crowded into that tiny waiting area, while everyone else has to sit and wait. I truly hope that they leave it like this.
Oof. This title ain't it chief. If you know someone who had to go on a vent... 
I've actually found the metro to be more pleasant now compared to the beginning of the pandemic. Still a few people not wearing masks right, but in the early days (I think it would have been April/may 2020?) it was pandemonium. Maybe 1/5 people had masks and everyone was tense.

Montreal drivers complaining about Montreal cyclist taking up space on the road. Montreal cyclist complaining about pedestrians on cycle paths. Montreal pedestrians complaining about cyclist on pedestrian streets.
There's a common theme here, I'm not sure what it is.
√† pointe saint-charles aussi c'est la m√™me affaire, les joggeux sont dans les pistes cyclables, les b√©ciques sont sur le trottoir pis les ptits vieux en cart sont en plein milieu d'la rue
I'll give an opposite point of view, without taking anyway from yours:
Please, for the love of life and all that is Holy, please use the bike path when there is one. I live in Chambly now, near the 223 - Boulevard P√©rigny. There is a dedicated bike path, separated from the 70km/h six lanes road by a cement border, five feet of grass and trees, and it's a nice flat bike path made of gravel.
I understand that there are not always bike paths and I am fine with sharing the road, really. But you'd be astonished at the number of cyclists who will forgo the bike path to cycle in the 70km/h six lanes road.
Like I said, this is a plea for safety. I understand there's problematic users amongst all the transportation modes, and that roads are meant to be shared, but please, be safe.
solution: courir plus vite que les cyclistes √† v√©lo
I'm an avid cyclist and activist for more cycling paths. My only issue with joggers and pedestrians on cycle paths is that they want to use space that cycling advocates fought for, but often don't join that fight themselves. We all deserve safe, smooth, spacious routes that are protected from cars and trucks.  I think the more people out of their cars the better. Sidewalks suck. They are too narrow, usually bumpy, not  easy to descend from and I do NOT mind sharing space with all manner of pedestrians, joggers, etc.
If everyone who ever jogged or walked on that nice safe new bike path thought to join the pressure to remove parking, narrow roads and put pressure on politicians to provide more space for people, then we wouldn't have to fight over scraps.
I commute daily by bike through the West Island to work and back, and it is incredible the amount of people who walk or jog in the bike lanes. 
The few times I have politely pointed out that this lane is not for pedestrians, the replies are often a snarky "I am allowed here too"
Well...you aren't: 
["Road signs and pavement markings indicate that these lanes are reserved for cyclists."](https://saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/road-safety/modes-transportation/bicycle/signs-signals-bikeways/)
[Since 2014, cyclists, electric bikes, rollerbladers, wheelchairs and motorized wheelchairs are permitted. But scooters, mopeds, joggers, walkers and skateboarders are not](https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montreal-bike-paths-whos-allowed-on-whos-not)
I also don't understand people walking in the street instead of the sidewalk!? Usually 2 people side by side. I assume it's because the sidewalk is too narrow for them?
‚ÄúI am an avid cyclist‚Äù or ‚Äúas a walker‚Äù. Why do people feel the need to self identify into their respective armed camps before commenting? I‚Äôm an avid cyclist, a daily pedestrian and a frequent driver - all three have an equal amount of asshats
What about strollers?
Happens on the post-Vendome part of the maissoneuve trail every day, the sidewalk there is tiny though so I can't really blame them.
Sorry, but if I'm a pedestrian in your little image there I'm walking in your lane. It's either that, the middle of the street or the grassy/trash area. Cyclists and their "I own this part of the road" attitude, never gets old.
La pancarte dit "v√©lo" seulement.  Est-ce qu'il y a un r√®glement municipal qui dit que le logo "v√©lo" inclus les patins √† roues et les chaises roulantes motoris√©es?
Also please bike in the right direction‚Ä¶ (with the flow of traffic as pointed out)
So many times I see bikers biking on their opposite direction and I can‚Äôt stress enough how dangerous that is. When pulling out of a double stop it is too easy to miss the full speed cyclist coming in the wrong way of the street.
Just go bike in the street, you belong there as mutch as a car.
I know I will get flamed for this, but here it goes. I'm a jogger (10+ years) and I regularly run along the de Maisonneuve bike path (which used to have rollerblades on its signage btw). I'm not the fastest runner in the world, but I'm fairly quick (\~13 kph avg). I run as close to the edge of the lane as possible and always make room for cyclists when they pass, which includes scooting into oncoming car traffic occasionally.  I have tried moving over to the sidewalk, but I have found this to be even more dangerous for a runner. Pedestrians are slow and not accustomed to looking out for runners on the sidewalk. There are also far more cars backing out of driveways and blind intersections to contend with. For the most part, I think I get along with the cyclists on the path. Only rarely does one of you shout out at me "trottoire!" I agree that walkers should probably be on the sidewalk, but I think there should be increased tolerance for quick-moving runners. What I think makes more sense, since the bike paths already allow a multitude of non bike vehicles (ebikes, emopeds, one-wheels, rollerblades, etc) would be to have a min and max speed....something like 8kph to 25kph.
Dear Cyclists. Stop signs count for you too.
Surtout : ceci n'est pas un stationnement temporaire pour les autos/camions.
Quand vous utilisez une bande cyclables pour vous arr√™ter, vous forcez des cyclistes √† faire des man≈ìuvres inutilement dangereuses. Trouvez-vous un endroit s√©curitaire pour faire votre arr√™t.
Just scare them one at a time, buzz by real close or pretend to not see them head-on and hit the brakes at the last possible moment. 
People are stupid and unimaginative until it happens to them, then they understand.
Practice your singing like that guy: https://youtu.be/Ehh8ZdIMMj4
And e-scooters?
Les voies cyclables sont souvent la pour pouvoir justifier de l'exclusivit√© du reste de la chauss√©e aux autos‚Ä¶ Les autres se d√©brouilleront, s'ils ne sont pas en voiture ils ont surement le temps.
Tu dit que les joggers ne devraient pas aller dans cette voie, mais que les chaises roulantes ont le droit? De mon exp√©rience les joggers vont plus vite que les chaises roulantes donc je voie pas pourquoi les joggers te d√©range tant que √ßa. Vivre et laisser vivre, tu vis dans la ville la plus peupl√© du Qu√©bec, c'est sur que tu va croiser quelqu'un de temps en temps
Why not? Bikes go down the car lanes‚Ä¶ just feels fair
Soooo, someone is upset that the rest of us, at times use the bike lane with the same disregard that cyclist use every lane, all the time?
Pisses me off when cycling on the bike paths along the canal and pedestrians walk on the bike path but going in the opposite direction, AND they don't move off the path when a cyclist comes at them. And even worse, if that cyclist doesn't yield to them (which they should not cuz the pedestrians are in the wrong), and the pedestrians get really pissy.
Although people's lack of caring and attention is cannot be ignored and us extremely dangerous and frustrating, I do believe there is a significant issue with our urban planning.
Visiting any other city with decent and thought out urban planning is incredible because you realize how badly our city was planned.
The amount of areas outside of the center of Montreal that has no sidewalks, unprotected bike lanes, insane congestion where roads meet, no crosswalk where there should be one, everyone on the same signal... 
Our pedestrian streets are narrow (only one or two smaller people can walk comfortably), its terrible for anyone with mobility issues, either because of age, accident or disability. We let electric bikes, electric wheelchairs and scooters race through and on our bike lanes.
Anyone who has a pram/baby carriage or those drag along bags for groceries have to drag it up and down using our public transport. 
Again, we can't ignore the irresponsables behaviour from our fellow citizens and I often have very short but intense bouts of anger but I try to focus on better planning of space in order for fellow Montrealers can use the space we have without endangering themselves or others.
In the picture you link there's no room for pedestrians st all. Are they supposed to stay home?? Yes if there is a sidewalk I agree with you but in this example.. as a pedestrian I'd prefer to walk on the bike lane instead of the car lane!
Ironic
Ok ben les v√©los, je veux pas vous voir ailleurs que sur vos voies r√©serv√©es!
(Walking pedestrians aside) I don't think that most cyclists and driver's realize that runners don't go on sidewalks because it's just not healthy for them. Asphalt roads are much softer than concrete sidewalks, so if you're someone who regularly goes for runs it's better for you long term to run there. If Montreal wants to create more running paths next to bike paths, which I've seen, that would be great.
Bike lane? Oh, you mean that lawless Mad Max lane where the rules of the road don't apply.
There's an intersection at University Montreal metro that's at the bottom of hill. The bikers have no concern about pedestrians crossing there. The bikers need to go fast and god forbid they slow down for others.
If they're not going to follow any rules, why would anyone follow their rules? People can have a picnic in those lanes for all I care.
'cos bicyclists never break the rules. lol. speaking as a bicyclist.
OP you're right and thank you for bringing this to attention. That said it's hilarious how many redditors and west islanders and montrealers love nothing more than to bitch about cyclists on sidewalks as if west islanders even go anywhere without their car LOL. Although that's a seperate problem. If there is a cycle lane, let the cyclists use it, if there isn't,  then cyclists must share the road with cars. If the road is too dangerous to cycle, then they must find an alternative route or bring it up with their city council, but cyclists do not belong on the sidewalk and montrealers have got to stop bitching about it. Those who do it will not stop because an anonymous redditor is upset.
These are so dangerous
While you're right, I suggest ducking. Once the car addicts see this they will lose their minds. Cyclists can never be allowed their space or rights.
Interesting, reminded me of how jay walking was a crime invented by automobile clubs... 
https://new.portside.org/2015-01-21/forgotten-history-how-automakers-invented-crime-jaywalking
This is how people that drive cars feel whenever cyclists decide to go on the main road when there is an empty bike path right next to them
These are probably the same people who ride their bikes on sidewalks
It's because they're so foreign to us. Maybe if our mayor got it together and started putting in bike lanes and paths, we could grow accustomed to it.
And eskates! Mouhahahha
This is a problem in all of montreal's parks. The city refuses to put up signs saying it's for wheeled-movement only because it would be "non-customer-friendly".
The only thing keeping pedestrians off these lanes are those midlife cyclists in their spandex speedlusting and blasting judas priest in their earbuds
...and skateboards
This really grinds my gears
Tell me about it. In and around Downtown, you've also got every manner of motorized modes of transportations on bike paths as well: motorized scooters, vespas, electric skateboards, uniwheels, you name it. It's super dangerous.
Also to West Islanders:
The paint along the sides of the road [here](https://goo.gl/maps/uv7BPFfivKg1L6RR6) denotes a shoulder, not a continuation of the Bois De Liesse bike path. Stop giving me the stinkeye when I pull over here to make a phone call or reset my GPS.
I hate all the dog walkers who also don't keep an eye on the leash even more. I onced got a dog run on the path because they always have the dog to the wrong side and he got hut by a bike at full speed. Dunno if he was chasing a bird or something. Even worst, I use an electric unicycle so if it would have been me, I would have flew off my wheel.
Or strollers. Fuck them!
In the West Island there is a nice long bike path along pierrefonds blvd that is used by almost no one except a few leisurely cyclist and some joggers. Most of the cyclist prefer to ride a hundred meters to the north in the middle of the single lane gouin blvd
They actually aren't. 
That is a Bande cyclable, which prohibits everything other than bicycles. 
If it we're a piste multiusage, those other things would be allowed

Great job /u/alex_kasyan_artist! The treatment on the bridge, and the greenery on the left are really fresh and exciting.
I'm guessing this was this done in acrylic? What size canvas are you on, and what's your process for these - do you do any thumbnailing, value studies, pre-sketch, etc.?
I adore this. It makes me want to start painting again ü•≤. I can just imagine the quiet hum of sitting by the water and the wind against the grass and trees.
This is so lovely, thank you for sharing this! We need more beautiful art like this of Montreal imo üòå

Word of warning do not walk on that bridge, though the sign is hidden and theirs a walk way its illegal, same as crossing train rails. 
Their was a cop hiding waiting to fine anybody who crossed 150$. Never went on that stupid bridge again.
wonderful work and view altogether !
Hey I saw you and your friend working on that yesterday! Watched you guys for a bit as I'm trying to get into painting myself, if I knew you were a fellow Redditor I would've said hi. Absolutely beautiful painting btw!
Great composition and subject.
I'd love to hang it in my appartment !
Lovely üíê
Near that office building on St Ambroise?
Lol my buddy took the photo of yall whilst painting
Thank you! It is oil on panel, 8x10. These paintings are done alla prima. I start with a thin wash of background color creating a color base over the white panel. Following that I build layers of paint over applying thicker paint with each pass. The photo doesn't do justice to the original in my opinion as it doesn't reflect the effect of the size and detail relationship. 
These are fun to do, especially since the weather is so nice out.
Lachine Canal is a great spot for painting. I went out painting with my buddy and we met another artist who came to do a watercolor painting of this location.
Thank you very much!
Thank you!
Thanks!
Thank you!

Rooftop of the Montreal General Hospital Parking lot.
Its abt 6 photos stitched together.
I never dared walk onto the top of that parking lot, to take some photos...
I am totally surprised they did not close it and moved it to the Arthur Porter Memorial Hospital, because that building would make terrific condos, and doing that would totally fit in the corrupt mindset of the liberals...
That building would make for absolutely terrible condos, I highly doubt the floorplate, wiring, plumbing, insulation basically anything behind the walls would be suitable for a residential building, there's probably asbestos in the walls.
They'd sooner knock it down and build something new over it then try to convert it.
They are still talking about it but they are at the same time sinking millions into it to renovate it so who knows what will happen to it.

Pas certain de ton interpr√©tation de ¬´ fixed ¬ª dans la mesure o√π le toit montr√© semble une toute nouvelle construction avec des ajouts, plut√¥t qu'une r√©paration, non?

Je pense que ton interpr√©tation n'est pas mauvaise non plus. Je voyais le "fixed" comme un clin d'oeil au fait que le toit a souvent √©t√© bris√© et jamais r√©ellement termin√©.
Dans cette phrase, 'fixed' signifie fix√©, maintenu, immobilis√©, imuable, qui ne bouge pas. En opposition au toit actuel du stade qui n'est pas fixe.
Ou peut-√™tre que oui, on veut dire r√©par√©, mais je ne crois pas.

This is a bit of a sidebar, but can someone explain the psychology of someone who gets in their car with the sole intention of driving around and honking their horn becausesa team won a game in another continent?
Just trying to understand the goal, not hating. It just  seems like an oddly specific and non-intuitive reaction to good news. I get being excited, maybe high-fiving a few people in the room - but picking up your car keys to drive around and randomly honk is baffling.
To think of England won, the celebrations would most likely only span the Burgundy pub and bits of the West Island

it's not so much about the team winning, but an opportunity to celebrate your heritage
Because there's something emotional that just happened that has the potential to be a shared experience. For many of us, we watched at home and had the winning feeling on our own or with a few buds. Driving around honking and cheering allows us to find other fans with whom to share the jubilant energy. Things like this are always more fun when shared. :)
Sort of reminds me of my time in Barcelona in which every time FCB scores a goal, the whole city jubilates with the sound of a car‚Äôs honk  and the word ‚Äúgoal‚Äù being inescapable
Yes, and that is because Montreal anglophones don't exactly identify as British.
West Island might be anglo but I doubt it has a large British population lol
West island...they don't care about England.  If Canada won at anything, that would be different.

Evenko's playground
Honestly the funniest/saddest part to me is that it's not only worse as a park; *it's worse for concerts, too*. The surface is hot, there's *zero* shade, it's too hard to sit down on, and so on. I went to Osheaga for several years in a row before the pandemic and my impression was definitely that both the original configuration and the alternate site on √éle-Notre-Dame were better than the shiny new plaza they unveiled in 2019.
A big outdoor concert, especially an all-day festival, is not just 40,000 people all standing shoulder to shoulder 500 rows deep. You have some people standing that way at the front, of course. But as you go back beyond that pit, you get more people sitting on blankets, resting under trees, spreading out and lounging around, etc. 
I don't mind the idea of a permanent platform for a stage and a standing crowd, but the footprint of the concrete should have been much smaller, with meadows behind that, with some light copses of trees/planters/furniture/etc sprinkled around, making for a more gradual transition back into the forest. That would've been more pleasant for concertgoers, and also much more useful and natural-feeling the rest of the year.
Honestly it's such a disaster that I think the city should spend the money to fix it, even if it just reopened. I don't think Plante's suggestion of reducing the number of stages is the right way to reduce the impact on the park. That will reduce the diversity of acts at the festivals, and it won't do anything to address the actual problem, which is this enormous ugly unpleasant concrete field.

Montreal used to be full of culture, music joi de vivre. Now its mostly condos and fucking air bnbs. Famous clubs closed cause new condos complained. This is a visual metaphor for what montreal has started becoming over the last 10 years.

How is this even supposed to make music festivals better though??!!

There used to be so many trees and such. It was amazing. 
It's impressive right now, but not really in a good way.
Standing on concrete for 10+ hours is never fun - even when listening to music.
I‚Äôve been to Osheaga multiple times, this will make me think twice about making the trip from Ontario.
I loved the fact that there was so much nature and ‚Äúpark‚Äù around the site, such as the pool.  In other words, not simply a permanent spot for a few events that sits unused the rest of the year.

I‚Äôd never thought about it that much but everyone is right. Makes no sense at all. They basically built it for hosting a few festivals (poorly with no shade, place to sit, and then there is nothing there ALL year. Ridiculous

Last time I was there was in 1998 for Van's Warp Tour.. Loved that parc and that amazing event by the way. This to me looks like they really fucked up its landscape which was the best part of this parc. Greedy dicks.
If you ever witness these types of incidents get an image of the perpetrator‚Äôs face, phone 911 and follow safely at a distance. 
As a fairly big guy if I witness any sort of violence that is victimizing someone frail or weak I would yell STOP/ARR√äT and flag down the next big guy I see on the street to assist. 
Remember; you can‚Äôt yell help as it‚Äôs ineffective. You must physically point at someone and ask them to help. It‚Äôs basic psychology 101.
Racism against Asians is just dumb. There's so many good Asians here, direct your hate towards the CCP, that's the target.
The amount of 'I'm helping!' casual racism in this thread is worrisome. 
The comments that are in support of the movement are eyebrow raising. You don't need to asterisk your support of anti-Asian racism.
Been thinking about this a lot lately. See Asian women and feel so bad, I hope this isn't as widespread as it seems to be popping up in the news. Not everyone hates anyone else.. I'm  white dude and I have no issues, prejudice or doubts of anyone of any race as a principle. We all have pieces of shit, it's sad that this is a thing. Hopefully if anyone sees this hate speech or verbal assault happens you stand up for your fellow peoples.. I know I will.
Anyone see that picture of the cop following behind the demonstrating giving the demonstrators the finger? https://www.instagram.com/p/CMxIZ42H1Z9/?igshid=nq4to28esrhe
I feel bad for my neighbor sometimes. She's Asian and I see her looking around everytime she goes to her car as if someone was gonna either physically or verbally assault her.
Worst of all of this to me is that it doesn't even seem to be about race really, it's just an excuse and these people think that Asians are hated by all so no one will care if they assault them.
It's like people who beat up wife beaters or child molesters; they don't do it out of a sense of justice, they do it because it's an easy target, they wanna bully someone to make themselves feel good and they know NO ONE will defend them. It's a cowardly act.
This is hapening throughout Canada :

So are anti Asian crimes actually going up or are we just assuming they are because social media and main news stations say so. I'm seriously curious to see some real data on this
Seems like a good opportunity to date for yellow fever guys like me
James Franco with noose around his neck meme and '*insert your ethnicity*' label:

The rigorous discipline required to cultivate individuals capable of confronting the evils of racism and violence is antithetical to today's unicorn fart society. 
So many of these disgusting attacks happened in broad daylight, in front of numerous bystanders who chose to carry on as though nothing was happening. 
The cold truth is that most are weak, cowardly, and effective only at regurgitating platitudes and posturing. 
We will need more than marches organized by political vultures to set our world right. We need to genuinely start breaching the confines of our ego created shells and find the courage to love each other as fellow human beings.
Was this in Montreal? Why were most of the signs in English then?
Once again people in Montreal follow the trendy social movement in the US media du jour. We are living under a curfew that restricts our basic rights as citizens to move freely and travel in and out of the country freely, but now because it was erroneously reported that a shooting in Atlanta of all places was a hate crime (it wasn‚Äôt, he was killing sex workers), people protest. Unbelievable thing to see. When will people here realize that this isn‚Äôt the united states....

[Here's some more bystander intervention tips.](https://www.ihollaback.org/bystander-resources/)
On the day of this march, I witnessed an act of violence on St Catherine. A kid no older than 14 punched another 14-yo kid in the face twice, and then kicked him in the groin. They appeared to belong to the same group of teenagers walking around. This was downtown on St Cath, 2 blocks from the police station, in broad daylight, among DOZENS of people, and there was police everywhere for the march. I was so shocked and I didn't know what to do, apparently no one knew. Minutes later I realized I should have just yelled "stop". It made me so sad and shocked.
Racism against any peoples is just dumb.
Idiots are angry about covid and are looking for a target to vent their frustration on. Oh look, the virus came from China so all Asians are the culprits ! This is so mind numbingly idiotic that it makes my brain melt. It's on par with people sending hate on social media to actors because they don't like their character in a show.
What does that even mean?
There's so many good asians here. What?
We can not change the CPC.
So I'd rather direct my hate towards the local racists and fascists since that's something that we CAN change.
Governments and corporations convinced us to hate each other based on ethnicity, race or politics. You can attack the CCP without hatred for Asians, just like you can call Israel an ethnofascist apartheid state without being anti-Semitic, or Saudi Arabia a degenerate state sponsor of terrorism without being Islamophobic. Most Montrealers know this, I try to believe.
I would go even more specific and say to direct your anger towards the CCP policies that you find objectionable.
[removed]
Racism as a whole is just plain dumb. 
We should have denounced it when we did BLM but everybody just wants the spotlight. We all want equality only if we're the centrepiece. 
As an Asian though, some of the stuff is exaggerated. The whole "they called me corona" is brought up in our own communities. We say it ourselves when people came from Asia and joke about it ourselves. 
You can't play the xenophobe card if only white people say it. That's hypocrisy. 
Honestly, seeing how some of us do not even want to name out kids traditional names or even teach our kids our native tongue, the whole Asian pride reasoning is very lame.
Oh come on. It‚Äôs damned if you do, damned if you don‚Äôt; I‚Äôd rather show my support than remain silent. Don‚Äôt be such a misanthrope.
[deleted]
If you're willing to step in, let her know if she's scared she can come to you, or keep an eye on her in case she ever does need help
maybe she‚Äôs just scared of covid and other people?
How is targeting Asian people because you assume everyone hates Asians *not* racism?
Also are you advocating *against* beating up child molesters?
In the time it took you to write this vaguely dismissive comment you could have done the research yourself.
These marches do serve as a way of drawing public attention and galvanizing political action. I know for a fact that this Montreal march has done that. For example, there are now legal professionals assisting Asian elders to report hate crimes who have been connected through social media groups that helped organize this march.

Too thin skinned to face the truth, but they'll stand up to violent racists. What a joke.
Because many Asians in Montreal are recent immigrants and students to Canada. Learning one language is hard enough and if they do not just want to limit themselves to Quebec, learning English first make the most sense.
The protest is to decry racism at home but also to show support for those globally and our neighbors in the USA, English is a more universal language.
there was a OQLF budget meeting at the same time
I think the signage in English reaches more people internationally. This increases the audience and therefore the cause gains more supporters. If you look at images of past protests from other countries, you will see English signs along with the local language. 
Any form of racism, sexism and all the other forms of bad behaviour should not be happening on this planet.
Je me disais la m√™me chose aussi. C'est quand m√™me dr√¥le qu'il y ait pas une seule affiche en fran√ßais.
There has been a [dramatic increase in Asian-targeted hate crimes across Canada](https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/reports-of-anti-asian-hate-crimes-are-surging-in-canada-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-1.5351481), which is what the march was focused on. But sure, keep reaching.
You realise a lot of Montreal and  Quebec Asian communities and people have been victims of a reason uptick in violence and harassement as well? It's not a trend. People aren't protesting JUST for the Atlanta killings either, there have been other assaults, there have been more racist attacks and vandalism even here at home.
Sure, I‚Äôll believe what the killer said... killing sex workers who all happened to be Asian huh? What a coincidence. Also, asians are being harassed here, whether you acknowledge it or not.

Thanks! I actually had to do some editing: the long-exposure was going great until a car drove by at the last 10 seconds of the flyover and ruined the shot. So, it's a composite, but past similar photos I've done I don't create composites.

Opinion personnelle, la visite de fant√¥me c'est plut√¥t des Acteurs qui font un show que des gens qui font des vraies visites guid√©es

Heavy, not really, if you want something not expensive try film cameras, good ones can be around 200 $ and each film(36pictures) is around 26$ to buy and develope, film is a bit harder to use but the results are worth every penny, check out r/analog

Good message, but why on top of such a beautiful artwork?
I love that burrito wall thing
This is completely off topic, but I visited Montreal from Brisbane, Australia in 2012. I took a photo of this artwork, and I‚Äôve always loved the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt you want a burrito‚Äù part. I didn‚Äôt think I would ever see this again, and I was surprised to see this on my front page today. I would love to look at this on google maps, is there any chance someone could let me know the exact location? Thank you in advance!
Good thing I took a picture years ago so we can remember how great it was.

The ultimate victimization slogan. Just because a tragedy occurred doesn't mean sayings like these have any validity.
The perpetrator made it clear that he was targeting specifically women. 
From Wikipedia:
> On December 6, 1989, Marc L√©pine entered a mechanical engineering class at the √âcole Polytechnique and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. He separated nine women, instructing the men to leave. He stated that he was "fighting feminism" and opened fire. He shot at all nine women in the room, killing six. L√©pine then moved through corridors, the cafeteria, and another classroom, targeting women for just under 20 minutes. He killed a further eight before turning the gun on himself.
And there have been two mass shootings in Montreal since Poly.
I'm not sure I understand how you see it then. He shot targeted and killed women, not men that makes it feminicide by definition. Also he did this in an institution of learning for a field that is largely dominated by men. If I were a woman thinking about going to Polytech in the years following I would definitely have reconsidered, I believe his actions had a large impact on women in university at the time.
Also thank fuck it's never happened again like this. I don't know how this being a crime against women would make it more likely to be reoccurring.
Alek Minassian would like a word.

I get it, he had serious problems and hated women, I get it, was horrible and insane. Still, one crazy guy doing something is not indicative of much, in my opinion. And all the downvotes and inability to enter into calm discussion will not change that. Thanks for your answer.

Maybe because there aren't entire groups formed around the hatred of school children? And that school children don't exactly forma distinct group other than "easy targets".
He's on the wikipedia list. The victim's names were:

- Christopher Ross Michaels-Martinez, 20
- Veronika Elizabeth Weiss, 19
- George Chen, 19
- Cheng Yuan "James" Hong, 20
- Weihan "David" Wang, 20
Except he killed more men than women.
Ah yes, clearly events can only be analyzed within a specific local context because reasons.

Doesn't change squat about his motivations. I won't get too much into it because Wikipedia does a much better job than i could do, but he did describe himself as an incel and his "retribution" revenge was caused in great part by frustration due to being rejected by women.
[deleted]
He was not because incels were not a group at the time, but we can safely infer he would have been now that people who espouse his exact ideology/world-view organise as group.
Two of the other examples I've provided happened in Canada. But it's clear you have no intention of arguing in good faith, so I'll just downvote and move on. Kthxbai.

Your shot got me hyped to have a drone, ~~do you need any drone pilot license~~ to fly the mini or the weight make it all good?  
edit: Nevermind i found the info, you don't .
No issues with aeronautical restrictions?
Nope ‚Äî it falls just under the weight requirement where you have to get approval to fly it.

Verdun et ses magnifiques sentiers forestier. Une ville au coeur de la nature !!!!
Est-ce que c'est plus facile √† stationner quand le d√©neigement tarde?
Two winters ago, I came across a guy dog-sledding down Notre-Dame (intersection with Atwater). Nothing surprises me either :)
I live in Verdun too. What avenue?
Au Plateau et √† Verdun l'√©t√© en Vespa, l'hiver en Ski-Doo
En 1971 mes parents habitaient √† Verdun et ma m√®re √©tait tr√®s enceinte avec moi. Le 4 mars il y‚Äôa eu une ¬´¬†temp√™te du si√®cle¬†¬ª qui a d√©pos√© une cinquantaine de centim√®tres de neige en quelques heures. Mon p√®re travaillait au centre ville et a trouv√© quelqu‚Äôun qui l‚Äôa emmen√© √† Verdun en skidoo. Je suis n√©e la semaine suivante.
A snowmobile makes sense to be fair. It's the determined unicyclist that I've seen while waiting for the 61 in all sorts of weather that blows my mind.
Tim‚Äôs in lachute has more skidoo‚Äôs than cars on the weekend üòÇ
Jo Corm qui revient de sa tourn√©e de skidoo
That‚Äôs a daily occurrence in my hometown of Timmins, Ontario. I remember kids taking their sleds to school in the winter.
un beau mach-z
j'en ai vu un se promener √† l'est du parc lafontaine √† la premi√®re temp√™te de √ßt'ann√©e.
Hey that's me!
A Verdun ?  Jai vu pire lol
This is hilarious ü§£ maybe I could hitch a ride to the local supermarket.

C'est chill si tu verses un peu de gatorade dans le r√©servoir d'huile.
Faut croire que oui...
Bah, √ßa se stationne pas mal o√π tu veux avec un Skidoo!
There was a guy w a makeshift dog sled going along the canal last week...it was constructed from wood and was just, like, a standing platform?? He kept veering off centre haha but it was cool
Manning, just below Bannantyne.
When I lived in western NB people would take their sleds and 4 wheelers to tims and mcdonalds regularly in the winter.  You had to be careful once you got past grand falls heading west because people would do crazy shit on the trans canada.

T'as pas besoin de c√©dille! R'monte ta cedille en apostrophe: Cette + ann√©e = c't'ann√©e!
Post proof
You don‚Äôt look anywhere close to the middle aged gentleman who was riding it...
Look mom I'm on the internet!
I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd give you a ride!
The guy was having a blast for hours on his skidoo, he didn‚Äôt bother anyone nor was he bothered by anyone. He‚Äôs also in a public environment on a vehicle that is highly uncommon in urban areas, it‚Äôs bound to attract attention.

Right. I see it now. Very nice!
√áa n'a pas rapport avec la pauvret√©, quand on parle d'HoMa ca regroupe Hochelaga et Maisonneuve (qui font partie d'ailleurs du regroupement Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve), et √ßa a beaucoup de sens "localement", car les gens se sentent du m√™me quartier (ca regroupe par exemple la promenade Ontario avec le march√© Maisonneuve).
Ouais vraiment certains sont cool mais il reste la a pourrir
√áa quand m√™me un peu rapport, c'est un truc de d√©veloppeur immobilier pour vendre des condos... Hochelaga c'√©tait pas trop vendeur et HoMa sonnait plus "cool" comme SoHo, Nolita, etc. √áa vient pas des gens du coin √† l'origine.
Mais c'est vrai que Hochelaga et Maisonneuve c'est un beau couple. Mais pas Mercier (/s).
Yes apparently you always need food with you while drinking in public areas. I was approached by cops a while ago while drinking a bottle of wine with a friend, had a empty food container. He explained to me that I should leave a ‚Äúpiece‚Äù of food visible to avoid getting a ticket.
You always need some food. Before the law was that any food would do, so I would always keep crackers around. then they changed it to "substantial" amount of food, which of course, who judges that? So basically always buy something to eat with booze. yes, it makes no sense and sucks, and definitely insane to do when others not getting hit, but it's like that, sucks ass
Im pretty sure thats a drinking in public ticket, not a social distance ticket as those are much more expensive. You cant drink in the parks unless its a picnic with food, its a silly law I know. Just pointing it out there in case you decide to contest the ticket, as Im not sure if youll have much of a case.

Just going to point out that people informing you of the correct law so you and other people don't get fined are not bootlickers but being helpful.
Wow, that is total bullshit
How did your interaction go? Was it "Sorry officer, can I put it in another container or dump it?" Or was it "Why aren't you bothering them? It's just a fucking beer dude, relax. Don't you have a real crime to investigate?".
I've been approached by the police for drinking in public or smoking weed before legalization dozens of time. Not once have I gotten a ticket, just a sensible conversation between adults that resulted in being more discreet.
So you break the rules, get dealt the consequences and then you come here to whine about it all?
The only point here is that cowardly cops only go after people in small groups who wont push back. Everything else about food, blablabla is noise. Go to tamtams on sunday and see if everyone has a snack with their booze.
Contest it? Did you have food?
Step 1. Break rules
Step 2. Suffer the consequences
Step 3. Try to whine about it on reddit in hopes to make yourself feel better
It's just cowardice, they can give tickets to pairs and small groups because they aren't likely to get too much push back or a major upheaval that they can't handle. 
When the crowd suddenly outnumbers you 10-1 they just put on their little sirens and ask politely people to leave because they don't want to start something they can't handle.
Break the laws, faces consequences *Pikachu face*
Yesterday me and a friend got a 128$ ticket each for skateboarding when we were on our way to a fucking skatepark... telling us we skating in the middle of the street, but we were actually on the side walk. I tell them we weren‚Äôt in the middle of the street so why the ticket. She proceeds to then threaten to give me another ticket for skateboarding on the side walk. Cops here are fucking bored.
why are you crying? it is illegal to drink in parks. you got caught. get over it.
Yes, the cops just like any other thug gang will alway hit the weakest. So unless you got the numbers on your side, stealth and concealment is your best friend.
Regulars of the park could also look for ways to support people that get targeted by cops, this could help. It sucks that one of my fav parks in town is getting more policed apparently... usual lack of cops (except during the tam-tams) was one of its best aspects.
You need to eat food too and be in a picnic area, but yeah still very lame.
Fuck them.. they are the worst outlaws out there, at least in terms of danger and peace troubling...
This thread reinforces why r/Montreal is one of the most toxic subs on Reddit. Some of you are sad.
Don't be pissed. You took a chance, but you lost on this occasion.
They probably picked on you two because they didn't want to actually do anything effective or deal with the hassle of intervening in a larger group that was actually problematic and instead opted to create some documentation that illustrated they did something for the day (not sure if booze tickets are a part of any sort of quotas they have).
I'm also not sure why people come to threads like these to act righteous and tell you that you deserved it.  If someone believes there's justice in fining people for finding some sense of normalcy and enjoyment during one of the most depressing eras in most of our lives, and then they have the proclivity to imply that we shouldn't ever examine the merits of laws and when they're enforced, I'd like to put them on a list so I can never invite them to my (future) parties.
It‚Äôs a shitty ticket but you technically broke the law dude. Be happy you got that and not a covid related ticket
Should have said you're a cannibal then looked at your friend.
Wow, you‚Äôre such a hard criminal. So glad the police are cracking down on tough criminals causing harm to the city with their blasphemous beer drinking. /s
No but seriously, I wish cops actually did something to help society. I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you. üò£
Well... It's been like that forever
You can't just drink in public in a park ... That's not related to Covid or anything.... Next time, bring food with you, you will be able to drink WHILE eating. They are not stupid, even if you show them food but you're not eating, you'll get a ticket...
Should've smoked weed instead. That gets enforced less.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
You failed at having a beer in public. The lesson to learn here is.. don't fail again.
Were you sitting at a picnic table installed by the city?
legalize public drinking  
legalize jaywalking
Illegal detre sur le gazon amoin tu fait un picnic. Keep it in mind have a cracker in your jacket
Carry some peanuts or other food if you want to drink in a parc in Montreal, you can have a fine for public drinking if you only have alcool, but if you have food it's a picnic and you're allowed.
You know you should bring food there... that's what P-1 3 permits.
Did you argue with the cops?
All year they have been looking for people who drank without food but gave warnings.
They came to us both friday and saturday but only gave warnings again. They said they only gave tickets to people who refuse to cooperate.
It is ridiculous but just make sure you got a bag of chips with you next time.
Got one too A few months back.
 Trying to be safe and not gather indoors. Thanks spvm.
Yeah it sucks and I wish they would crack down on the bigger groups, but realistically how are 6 cops ganna crack down on a group of 50 people?
Did you have bottles or cans? I‚Äôve talked to cops in a park before while having a can of beer and they told me it was ok (we had no picnic) as long as it wasn‚Äôt glass, in which case they will fine you
I don‚Äôt have words to describe how fucking useless the police in this city are
Total bullshit.
The asinine curfew aside, other "rules" also don't make a lot of sense sometimes.  I once got a $150 fine for "not taking in my recycling container", which was a clear plastic bag that was sitting out on the curb for days in the rain because the recycling truck didn't show up, so the city fined me because the city didn't do it's job. * *slow clap* *
Twice I've had cops ask me to pour my drink out at the park and they just gave me a warning, no fine.  Those cops you had to deal with were useless cunts on a power trip.  In the future if you don't want to have food around you could do what we do and just put your drink in a coffee cup.
Why push the limits and then complain that others are doing worse things? Have a beer with your roommate in your house, or backyard, dont go to a park... 
I get your sentiment and somewhat agree but just give it a couple more months........
Yup beer outside is a nono. Real ones know the polar pop trick lmao
I once got a public drinking ticket on Durocher and Van Horne. I was walking 2 blocks from my apartment to a friend‚Äôs with an open bottle in a bag, not drinking. Cops pulled over and found it, then said ‚ÄúThis is Outremont, not Hochelaga‚Äù. They gave me a 400 dollar ticket to be paid in 7 days.
Pro Tip : Get drunk **before** going to the park. /s
Many of the metropolitan cities' websites state that "drinking alcoholic beverages in public places is strictly prohibited. The only exceptions to this rule are when beverages are consumed in establishments that hold permits issued by the *R√©gie des permis d‚Äôalcool du Qu√©bec* or consumed in a park with a meal, on the specific tables designated for it."

We are all guilty of taking certain "petty" risks that may be close or beyond the borders of what the law imposes.
When stopped by an agent of the peace, it is best to follow with the perception that their observation that you are contravening the law is valid. It is rare that it is not, and it is even rarer that you will change their mind by engaging in discussions. Attempting to argue or to lash out your perception of how arbitrary their application of the law is, unfortunately, does not help.
In your case, it does not matter whether the guys on your side were within less than 2 metres from each other (contravening the laws about public health safety) or whether there were groups of 8+ people around you, drinking, yelling and hugging each other (contravening the same law as you were and other ones about public peace and public health safety): their observation that you were contravening the law by drinking in a public space is still valid.
If you believe that the officer's observation was not valid, the place to contest it is in the courts, by declaring yourself not guilty of the offence. This requires solid proof that you were not contravening the law, and it requires effort, time, taking the risk that you will be proven guilty and have to pay court fees, and sometimes a lawyer.
If you find the law to be unfair and you believe it should be changed, you can approach the media and expose your propositions to lawmakers. This requires a very solid proposition, strong public interest, political desire (which very often are not in line) and time.
In the meanwhile, I find it that it is always good practice to read and to understand local and regional regulations, so that you are aware of the legal risks that you are taking and any of the penalties related to contravening the law. It does not only help with modulating your behaviour and avoid being surprised, but also helps you understand when you are not guilty of an offence and what do you need to prove to defend yourself in court proceedings.
Just declare "not guilty" and send it in. 
The Crown prosecutor and the cop have better shit to deal with and you'll most likely get the ticket reduced or thrown out before making it to court.
The cops go to the park because it lets them get out of the squad car and stretch their legs. If it's not something that they were assigned to then they need to basically validate their reason for being there. It sucks that you got a ticket but it's mostly because that cops particular Sergeant is being hard on them being in places they don't need to be.
What law did you break? There's no law that says you can't have a beer with your roommate because of Covid.
Moi, je suis v√©gane fak je juste commence √† manger le gazon lorsqu'un üëÆ approche. Je dis que le sol est mon repas. Je suis v√©gane en passant
Can‚Äôt drink in bars, can‚Äôt drink on patios (most of then aren‚Äôt big enough to allow distanciation), can‚Äôt drink inside, and can‚Äôt drink in parks? With the summer coming up I sure hope they‚Äôll smoothen the restrictions in park. If they don‚Äôt give us a safe space to drink and gather legally, people will do it illegally and in a way that promotes contagion.
Edit: what‚Äôs with the downvotes lol I‚Äôm just saying we should be allowed to have a distanced beer at the park without a full meal since we can‚Äôt have beers anywhere else.
Yeah, it's also all tiny condos. Great place to live in your 20s when you get your first job downtown or whatever, after that not so much. Once those buildings aren't so new and shiny it's going to feel like a real desolate wasteland.
I would like to add as well-- the Montreal triplex is a great example of responsible urban renewal! While they aren't highrises, they create decent population density. And in the same block, you can have a wide variety of apartments available. Run down ones that are incredibly cheap, newly renovated ones that are stylish and pricey, and everything in between. While it might be counter intuitive to think of a run down apartment as a social good, it keeps rent down for everybody. Easier to charge $2500/month if everything around you goes for the same price. But if there are $500 and $1000/month options available, it brings down the maximum landlords can get away with charging. Furthermore, you end up with different income levels and different kinds of people, which is incredibly important for social cohesion.
I would agree but Griffintown was a completely dilapidated area with a prime location, it‚Äôs not like they tore down thousands or even hundreds of apartments to build new high-rises. There weren‚Äôt many apartments there in the first place. It was mostly abandoned warehouses, factories and wasteland. Im not a fan of condo towers either but it‚Äôs better than what was there before imo.
We‚Äôre having our own SoDoSoPa! Any news of a Whole Foods?
As someone who's moved here from Vancouver (Yaletown), yeah, I'm 100% with you. I would understand if Montreal goes full protectionism over its urban identity. Montreal's urbanism is a big reason I moved here. My eyes are amazed everywhere I walk here. Old town, Saint Henri, Plateau... there's an incredible *sense of permanence* that I'd hate to see Montreal lose for sleek all-glass bullshit that I ran away from out west.
I also fully subscribe to Jane Jacobs urbanism (if you've lived in other cities worldwide she's exactly right). The soulless end of glass and franchise stores in Vancouver, compared to, well, everything Montreal is... Please dear god don't let this happen here. In my opinion, you fully can't delve into this without looking at neoliberalism's effect on everything in society but that's another massively complicated topic altogether.
My personal take: cities are not supposed to be perfectly designed (and so the question, perfect for whom?), or you end up feeling like you live in a theme park. I get that's what a lot of people want: pleasantry everywhere. Then the same people wonder where the soul or culture is? Great cities are give and take, and that exchange/interaction is what produces the so-called culture that attracts you to go check it out. There's no use in moving somewhere to "enjoy the culture" from high above if you have no intention of being part of the human fabric of what reproduces it. Otherwise, you're just a consumer of it and are only contributing to its dilution.
The current administration is working pretty hard to fix some of the problems. The previous administration didn't even planned for a school. No parks... This is being fix also.
At least if there is families it will bring some social diversity. Social housing is also part of the school project.
As for old an new building i'm not sure but I think there wasn't much old residential building there.

Griffintown is a mess. Every other street is blocked for construction. No parking. No amenities.
The city will never change anything though because there's such a high turnover on condos they make ridiculous amounts of money on welcome taxes. Most of the people who buy condos are young professionals or couples and once they want a family they sell. Lather rince repeat.
You do know that Griffintown used to be literally abandoned warehouses, parking lots and factories for decades right? It's much more beautiful now. Some urbanization like this definitely does not hurt abandoned areas like what griffintown used to be.
I think people in this thread are exaggerating the reality of the housing stock in Griffintown. Yes, there are a lot of tiny shoebox condos, but there are also larger apartments and townhouses. And there is also a lot of social housing in the form of co-ops. I think if you compare it to similar areas in Toronto like Liberty Village, Griffintown has a broader social mix.
Griffintown was developed in a very haphazard way but it was mostly parking lots, warehouses and auto mechanics before. Its population before 2006 was around 200 ‚Äì¬†and this is an area right next to downtown. A lot of the new buildings are really ugly but I think the density is very appropriate given its central location.
The big problem with Griffintown isn't the density, it was the lack of planning. But that was because of decisions made under the notoriously corrupt Tremblay administration, and these days there is a stronger planning process for other upcoming neighbourhoods like the Quartier des lumi√®res, the Molson brewery and the Portes Sainte-Marie.
I work not far from Griffintown and notice a trend of people not picking up their dog shit. They'll pay $2000 for a shiba inu or cockapoo, but not $0.99 for a roll of compostable poo sacks. The new greenspace in front of my office is going to be disgusting in spring.
Au m√™me moment, les quartiers centraux d√©fendent avec beaucoup d'acharnement leur b√¢ti historique. En fait, il y a tr√®s, tr√®s peu de construction r√©sidentiel dans les quartiers centraux en dehors du CV et par extension de Griffintown. Le d√©veloppement se fait juste sur quelques friches sp√©cifiques. Le reste, c'est de l'int√©gration. Par exemple, sur le Plateau, on ne peut pas construire plus haut ou plus bas que ses voisins dans une rang√©e de plex.
√áa fait qu'on prot√®ge une √©chelle fantastique, et qu'on emp√™che Montr√©al de se change pour le pire (aux yeux de beaucoup), mais √ßa fait aussi que ces quartiers connaissent une forte pression immobili√®re et ne peuvent r√©pondre √† la demande et la croissance d√©mographique.
On voit donc un ph√©nom√®ne en U de construction: beaucoup de constructions au CV (et Griffintown) dans des tours, et le reste en banlieue, l√† o√π il y a de l'espace pour construire. Et souvent en tour ironiquement de nos jours... (juste entour√©es de parkings).

Griffintown was a missed opportunity.  They replaced a shithole with a beehive.
Definitely something to watch out for... but it will be hard to turn Montreal into Toronto!  :)
Griffintown like Toronto? not really. Griffintown has social housing, affordable housing and regular condos, green space is being developed and it's part of an innovation quarter of downtown Montreal. Up until 2010, it was mostly abandoned and dangerous. Today it's where many people, from students to professions go live to be part of downtown. There's pedestrian only streets and better infra as well. 
The plan you see today is downscaled, this is mainly due to the 2008 recession. The first plan was $6B and was approved by Benoit Dorais (who is now part of PM). But of course, since cities are cash strapped and rely on property taxes, they allowed the scaled down version to go through. 
I can tell you Griffintown, despite the flaws, is better developed than almost all new neighbourhoods going up in cities between the U.S and Canada. At least street level is much nicer and isn't just entrances for parking lots (looking at you Southern Belt, U.S) and it's 100% better than the crap going up in Toronto too lol.
My wife‚Äôs friend has a unit in that condo building that has green windows (colour not environment friendly), i swear its the cheapest crap i ever saw. Everything is cheap, and I mean everything. Some units are good quality but this one is a nightmare. I read an article that basically said buildings with brick is solid and good, the ones with too much glass/windows are future slums. Toronto will have alot of this problem in the future. You can already see them falling apart. Cheers!
Jane Jacobs said, I think correctly, that no amount of additional property taxes could ever offset the cost of servicing these developments.
They‚Äôre built, or allowed to be built, (almost solely) for the purpose of increasing revenues but end up being a financial vortex!

Me, who wanted to move to griffintown: ü§°
Damn didn't know it was actually a bad idea, i really thought it was a nice new neighborhood with cute apartments and the canal view.
Don't like Griffintown and something tells me I don't particularly like the sort of people that choose to live there these days.

The reason those buildings are cheaply built and not well maintained is rent control. In order to not discourage new construction, new buildings are usually exempted from rent control. Eventually, rent control is applied to those buildings. This front loads the profits that can the building can earn. Without rent control, developers would be able to make longer term investments.
Ah look, nimbys in the wild!
Griffintown was factories back in the day.
That's why I'll always vote for someone like Val Plante over someone like Coderre.
[deleted]
What‚Äôs fun about Griffintown is that Montreal learned from it. It was one of the first gentrification projects and the city learned from these mistakes when developing others such as St Henri
you don't say, montreal practically built the rem going straight in to it.
"Potential"? It already is "little T.O."
For the love of God Montreal, do not ever allow yourself to become anything like Toronto. 
Toronto is a sterile, regressive wasteland where fun goes to die and everyone is a self-centred dickhead. That's why all the good art and food comes from Montreal, because conservatives don't live there.
And where in Montreal do you live?
Ikr, I could not believe how POORLY the condos are built. The city only sees as Jackpot rather than "actual living space." Huge disappointment on city and the companies working on the project.
Ah yes the city allowed a massive redevelopment project without thinking about "hey does the current infrastructure support this" which it didn't. Then there was an insane scramble to upgrade sewage, electrical and water supply. Peak redevelopment for me was when century old row houses were "damaged" during a dig and had be demolished... These same houses where the owners refused to sell
As a fellow refugee from Toronto who is in love with Montreal, I completely agree with you. I don't think there is much we can do to stop it, the real impetus is mass immigration of working age professionals. Canada used to bring refugee families, but now it brings condo buying young professionals.
It is going to be sad seeing what happened to Toronto also happen to Montreal.
Well, I have lived in Vancouver and Edmonton alongside southwestern Ontario. I have to say Edmonton has been incredibly gentrified these past few years, and Vancouver is way past no point of return, and Montreal will follow suit.
I wanted to try Toronto for a few years, but housing has me feeling a sort of way, so I looked into Winnipeg, and they seem to be going the route of gentrification as well.
So what is left?
Also, im not surprised about Montreal one bit! Anyone who is surprised is undoubtedly living in their bubble for the past few years.
i don't like or agree with arrogant rich people with a superiority complex but i can understand how they always try to separate themselves from the poor because being poor is sadly viewed as a contagious disease & they don't want beggars in their posh neighbourhoods. Or another example is how recipes work, they don't want to mix high quality ingredients with low q. ones (or just ones that would taste bad in it). A rich neighbourhood tries to do this, the neighbourhood being the recipe and the people are the ingredients.
unfortunately i don't think it's ever gonna change.
i don't understand tho how St.Jamestown failed? because of the lack of diversity? It seemed like the intent was good. i'm not the smartest guy so i'm probably missing a lot of stuff but personally i prefer low cost apartments in old buildings, they have more character and it fits with my preference of buying everything second hand but i know that some people only want luxury and brand new stuff (even tho i don't agree, it's not sustainable & very taxing on the environment). 
What is a good example of cities or neighbourhoods that are well balanced & stood the test of time?
100% agree! The Jane Jacobs book ‚ÄúThe Death and Life of Great American Cities‚Äù illustrates this view on neighbourhoods quite clearly! Its a shame that the book was written 1961, yet cities are just starting to catch onto the importance of urban planning focused on the well-being of individuals!
Bird‚Äôs eye view: https://imgur.com/a/tcVQC6M
I work in the neighborhood (well, did, before the pandemic) and I‚Äôve witnessed the transformation. There‚Äôs definitely too much of one thing in the area, doesn‚Äôt seem like balanced living.
To support your take on how spaces could be more livable ‚Äî check out the writings of Christopher Alexander (eg, The Pattern Language). Lots of interesting ideas in there.
Lol it‚Äôs basically the CityPlace of Montreal
Griffintown is an awful project completely devoid of charm. The city needs to resist these kinds of projects. We should build more medium density areas with triplexes instead, like in the Sud-Ouest and Verdun and let neighborhoods develop.
So people living in Tokyo don‚Äôt generally have the housing costs increase the way we do, and their population growth rates are high just like ours.

We are at a critical junction now, after Covid, where the number of people that will be able to work from home is as high as it‚Äôs ever been. We also have the REM coming online soon. Normally, densification means putting pressure on the transit arteries. We should take advantage of our current situation and a density while we can.
Build condos and bring in heroin, we are not becoming Toronto but Vancouver.
However there are tons of heroin busts happening around town, so maybe we can put a stop to this bullshit.
Small local business closing or selling out to big business (look at Adonis, I remember when that place was a small deli counter and fruit store on l'Acadie )
Ca Va Bien Aller ? 
I agree with the sentiment of your post
Toronto is a soulless city that incessantly copies Montreal but it will really never have any charm like Montreal. Anyhow, I don't want Montreal to become like Toronto but in the end we may have no choice. No matter what though, Montreal can never be a desolate wasteland of wannabe's like Toronto is. Old money, the Hollywood stars and tourists all come to Montreal eventually after they've spent the one day in Toronto to do whatever business they needed to do.
üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè (have heard torontonians say it is their favorite neighborhood in montreal)
I believe it is more due to poor urban planning from the city and and the free hand that private companies have on the development while disregarding the needs of the city. Best example is Griffintown where it only after they realise that the neighborhood needed a elementary school not before. I like how in a sense condos building are growing like mushroom but without the essential services being here, or if they are, being overused. Which stress young families to move out of the city center and go into the suburb which hold more space and more essential services and creates more urban sprawl.
Another point is that developers will always try make profit so condos are a faster way to make profit versus rentals which is why we have a housing crisis here in Montreal because of low supply and high demand. Their may be other factors, like the pricing bubble which makes condos that may worth less pricier which in turn few can afford to pay for such condos. 
I personally would prefer the government or the city administration to push to build their own housing to tackle the ever growing condos boom in Montreal but to solve the housing crisis in Montreal also. Best example is Singapour where with political willingness and many other factor help solve their housing crisis. Although here in Canada we tend to the bear minimum since budget are tight and while developers have lots of money to spend on lavish condos, city and government have much less to spend on public housing. That does not mean they are poor, but they prefer to allocate more money in other ressources like services and etc.
Here the link for the Singapour housing crisis and how they solve it. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cjPgNBNeLU&ab\_channel=BloombergQuicktake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cjPgNBNeLU&ab_channel=BloombergQuicktake)
I believe there is a way to densify the city with everyone taking part in it, both public and private groups. Versus having the city and government going toe to toe with the developers, it is important to better understand the need of the population, to work in harmony, hand in hand.
100% agree. The timeless way of building only ever happens when developers take pride in their work. This is the exact opposite of that.
1. Encourage density at human scale
1. Force many smaller developments over fewer monolithic ones
1. Prioritize owner/developers rather than ones who build, sell, and bail.
1. Prioritize development by people who live in the community. People who have no skin in the game don't care how what they build affects the community.

This is really neat. It really gives the impression that Montreal is in a valley, which I guess it kind of is?

OK so that helps explain the QC-US border for me.  
PS, it looks gorgeous
...and that is why I always rode my bike in Quebec when I lived in Ottawa.
This is so incredibly beautiful!!!
It looks great. I might have favoured a slightly less exaggerated vertical scale (the Laurentians are not the Rockie Mountains), but that's great.
An interesting tidbit of information. The highway map dates from the 1970s or 1980s (the 417 is there to Ottawa and there are some chunks of the 55 in Qu√©bec), yet autoroutes 13 and 30 are not there at all. But it also shows railroads that have been dismantled as early as the 1940s or 1950s.
Very cool map/rendering thanks for sharing
Neat! The adirondaxks and vermont can be seen just south...so cool
A really interesting perspective.
Nice work! I am confused though... Is that a picture of a 3D-printed map, or a 3D rendering? Because the elevated edge of the map is so clean, you either photographed it with a telephoto lens, or more likely, it is an all-digital rendering.
Love this so much! Is the elevation exaggerated?
In what form is this available? Eric efxp0000@gmail.com
Do you have one of just the island of Montreal? I'd love to have this on my wall!
Love it! Do you sell prints?
That's so cool
This is so cool!! Great job!
Ah, that's why it's called val√©e du st Laurent. History class really didn't demonstrate it well.
As someone who's been hiking a lot these days, this is cool to look at!
I love visiting "les 4 points cardinaux". I'm looking a composition of 3 maps, maybe montreal, NA, and world. It's hard to find 3 maps that can be composed together.
Thanks! Will use this to teach history in high school, if that's alright.
Awesome! You can really see how it's possible the whole valley was once a huge lake. I live in a transition zone between the St-Lawrence valley and the Appalachians, and the change is very apparent just like on your map.
You should sell high quality digital versions of this, or even like prints!

I‚Äôve seen others doing similar things so I wanted to make some of Canada. Also, I do GIS for a living so it‚Äôs not far off my normal work
I didn‚Äôt make the name unfortunately. Just happened to be what the surveyors decided to call this grid
Same here! That's a gorgeous piece of map!
It‚Äôs all digital rendering!
Yes it is quite exaggerated lool
I can look for vintage maps of the area and make one! I sell my works on Etsy under the shop name: Modern Cartography
Yes I do! On Etsy under the shop name Modern Cartography
I actually recently started to! Check me out on Etsy at Modern Cartography
OP a mentionn√© que l'√©l√©vation est exag√©r√©, j'imagine pour que √ßa *punch* plus comme rendu
Cool! So, is your process digital (3D printing w/ elevation data), or is this more if an artisanal thing (foam, layers of epoxy, paint, etc.)?
Just curious cause it looks so awesome!
Very nice!
I just looked through it and amazing work! But definitely yea, Montreal would be swell!
why the vintage map (for example the 1975 Montreal map)? Due to copyrights?
It‚Äôs all digital, I haven‚Äôt done any 3D printing as of yet but really want to in the future when I can afford it. Right now I just do digital renders like these
I just like the looks of vintage maps when I add the elevation to it
I have a printer! I‚Äôd print a a few small scale ones for free if you‚Äôd be interested. I‚Äôd like one myself.

March 24th me: the ambient noises outside were insufferably loud and I couldn‚Äôt sleep at all
March 25th me: apparently sleeps through biggest thunder storm in a while
I thought a plane was going to crash on my head. I literally woke up and was like "oh well that's it then" and prepared to die.
yeah it was so loud and roared for a long time.. didn't see the fish though.
That was great. First of the year? I thought "summer is coming"
Also, there was a sudden rainfall at 21:30 for about 10 minutes that stopped as suddenly. Weird.
[deleted]
Holy shit that was real? I thought I dreamt it
... My brain incorporated this into my dream
My house in sainte anne shook violently for several seconds. We thought that maybe a train derailed or something exploded. It was raining but there was no other thunder the entire night.
Here‚Äôs a decent explanation:
> In the more typical, surface based storms, sound waves dissipate in all directions. However, because of the temperature inversion air warming as you go up, in Elevated storms, the sound waves are trapped near the ground or get bent back toward earth or refracted. This trapping and refraction of sound can cause addition sound and amplify the sound of thunder, making it louder sounding. The trapping of the sound waves can allow the sound waves to bounce back and forth. This can also contribute to a louder boom and it can make the thunderous sound last longer too.
https://www.wmcactionnews5.com/2020/03/18/breakdown-when-thunder-rolls-why-boom-is-louder-times/?outputType=amp
Basically it‚Äôs like blasting a speaker in a small room as opposed to an open field. The storm was thick enough to trap the sound as opposed to letting it run free, allowing us to enjoy it‚Äôs terror several times over thanks to refraction.
Broo I felt it in pincourt üòÇit was loud like holy shit
I live in Saint-Lazare and saw the bright flash before the boom. I cannot wrap my head around it being only thunder, and how we all (a large portion of Qu√©bec) felt it simultaneously, and I find it even more curious how basically no news outlets have mentioned it...maybe a little later.
Plateau here, woke me up and I freaked out half asleep before making the connection with the rain
I was in the bathroom, thought it was me for a second.
C√¥te-des-Neiges here, woke me up and was so long and loud I wondered if it was an explosion. However, no one else in the house heard, I thought I was dreaming.
Uhm... Well i was doing an emergency fueling at Saint-Hubert airport at 3:45 and im pretty sure the bolt you're talking about was the one that hit the control tower... Because i really thought i was gonna die. My ears are still ringing right now
I simply cannot accept that that was thunder. I've lived in tropical countries with crazy lightning and storms, and this sound did not resemble anything I've ever heard. I had my window open and was staring outside as the sound was going on.  Simply don't believe it was thunder.
It woke me up here in Chambly. Very loud thunder.
Woke me up at 3h26 this morning. I live in Vaudreuil, crazy stuff!
aw I missed it
I'm downtown. I woke up up to an explosion so loud around 4 a.m. that my first half-awake thought was that it was a nuclear bomb. I got up and went to the window and saw the rain and concluded it was thunder, but boy, I've seen a lot of thunderstorms and have even seen lightning crash within a few hundred feet of me but this was louder than any thunder I've ever head. There was some thunder and lightning evident after that but it had a more typical volume.
Right? Couple fire trucks came up my road bout 20 minutes after, lights and everything. Guess they check out some backyards then left. I thought there was an airplane crashing into my house. Loudest thing I've ever heard in my life.
I AM SPRING, and I have fucking arrived.

Edit : C'√©tait un √©clair finalement.
Shook our entire house. It lasted for a solid thirty seconds. I don't think it was thunder but possibly a meteor hitting the atmosphere?
OMG I can tell you exactly what happened. Around 3:30 to 4am, a huge bolt of lightning hit a tree around 20m behind my house (Mont-Saint-Hilaire) and instantly blew it up. Everyone I've talked to reports this at the same hour. There are pieces of wood in a 75m radius around the tree. No one was injured.
Man every time something happens at night I miss it. If there's a faucet leaking a drop of water every minute I won't be able to fall asleep, but once I'm gone there could be an F1 race below my window and I'd sleep throught it.
It was wild. We woke up just before the storm and watched from the balcony. It was like that one thunder kept going. The cracks of lightning illuminated the sky....we face the mountain from the NE side. It was freakin awesome, we were out there for the whole thing.
Here is a link to a video of the affair, theres no way this is thunder haha [https://twitter.com/PhylBernard/status/1375062902823124996?ref\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet](https://twitter.com/PhylBernard/status/1375062902823124996?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet)
Brossard here ... super loud and abnormally long. I too wondered what it was because it seemed too long to be thunder
Live near Metro Peel.  Horrible thunder! Apparently, in ancient time in Mongolia they were afraid of thunders. Now I can get why.
Woke me up as well. But it did not wake up my dog. He usually hates thunder.
It was just a  thunder. My 7yrs old daughter have not hear it. Maybe the lighthing was close to you but from where i was a regular thunder. I‚Äôm belle-chasse and L‚ÄôAssomption
I'm in Saint Laurent. Heard two of them. Thought it was planes at first, I hear those often. But they were too loud and lasted so long. Definitely thunder.
Heard it here in Beaconsfield, went on so long thought it was a train derailment or plane crash. It was more 3:30ish for me.

EDIT: **MONTREALERS WAKE UP TO BOOM FROM THE HEAVENS, NOT AN EARTHQUAKE**
Montrealers were startled awake around 3 a.m. Thursday thinking the ground might be shaking, but it turns out it was the heavens jolting them out of their slumber.
"We, too, received about 30 reports of something strongly felt in and around the west end of Montreal Island, between 3:20 and 3:30 a.m.," said seismic analyst Nick Ackerley of the Canadian Hazard Information Service.
Both the Earthquake Track and Earthquakes Canada websites reported no earthquakes in the region, which Ackerley confirmed by checking seismographs in the region.
"Clearly a lot of people felt something frightening, but it was likely related in some way to the fierce thunderstorm that rolled through around that time," he said. ¬†
A low pressure system hit the region overnight which brought rumbles of thunder with it.
[SOURCE: CJAD](https://www.iheartradio.ca/cjad/news/montrealers-wake-up-to-boom-from-the-heavens-not-an-earthquake-1.14837718)
I was up, and saw it knowing it was going to freak the sleeping cat when the boom came. But why is it impossible to believe the most plausible explanation? Yesterday's weather forecast thunder at night, too.
Haven‚Äôt experienced it much in Montreal, but in Connecticut we would get rolling thunder like this pretty commonly.   That one was loud but definitely just thunder, esp since the storm started right after.  Sorry internet conspiracy theorists.
Yes! At 3:40 am. The thunder was so loud and it slowly faded away with a rumbling but it took a long time to stop.
I was closing my eyes to fall asleep, and I just snap out of bed after noticing a really intense flash. Opened my window to hear the roar. It was a particularly bright flash indeed.
The crazy thing is how it was only a single lightning strike, and everyone on the South shore heard it.
Me too!!! I was watching videos at 3:46 am (I think) I look outside FLASH I'm like " ok wierd whatever" then I hear this big ass BOOM and I'm like wtf???
From the West Island, heard it as well... I went back to bed instead of recording it ü§£
Damn you guys making me feel like I missed out
All I'm getting here is the sound of construction drilling the pavement at 8 am sharp :(
My dog heard it, poor muffin hates thunder and hopped into bed with me
"O**n that day, humanity received a grim reminder."**
Sorry guys, I had a lot of Taco Bell
"Theres no way that it was just thunder" meaning?

I love watching the sky. Always beautiful.
Great pic! 
Which part of Montre is that? I'm a sucker for old houses and that seems like a neighborhood I'd like to stroll in.
I agree.
The sky in Montreal was one of my favorite things about living there, especially at ‚Äúmagic hour‚Äù
summer in the northern hemisphere is great all around!
I was in a cab to the airport in Montreal at sunset in December 2014 and I texted a friend back in LA "this sunset is a visual representation of a chorus of angels singing"
Ah, you're finally awake !
Aren't pink clouds a sign of pollution?
Every evening, I go outside on my balcony and check out the sky with my boyfriend. It's a nice ritual. We've always have comments about the pretty colours. (yay pollution!)
It looks like Westmount up by the Summit Park.
It is westmount, streets that lead upwards from Aberdeen avenue and towards westmount summit park.
Is that golden hour or blue hour?  Both are amazing!
You were trying to cross the border, right?
It is, but it's not the only possible cause.
i've seen pink clouds in the yukon and alaska so don't think so. i may be wrong tho
Non, √ßa d√©pend surtout de l'humidit√©.
I go by the river (ile bizard) and watch the sunset, sometimes with a nice joint. Very enjoyable. Mont royal has amazing sunsets but I think the ones by water are superior as you can see the reflection. South Africa with it's huge mountains on the coast of the sea is probably one of the best places for that.
Th√©oriquement, ce n'est pas Montr√©al :).
I‚Äôve heard all those names used without distinction, depending if people were farmers, cinematographers, sailors etc. 
What‚Äôs the difference?
I had the chance to work inside the Arctic circle (or very close to it, Igloolik) in August 2011: the ¬´¬†night¬†¬ª was 45 minutes of pink sky.
I remember how intense was their ¬´¬†Let‚Äôs take our city back¬†¬ª campaign.
Golden hour is when every object glows a reddish-yellow.
Blue hour is the opposite, like in this picture, when everything has a bluish tint to it.
Not sure if it has to do with atmospheric conditions, or angle of light, or whatever, but both are pretty incredible. I think golden is right before sunset, and blue right after?
Thanks. 
i know in movies blue hour is when the sun has set but the light is still there. it‚Äôs like a 45-60 minute window. I think Terrence Mallick is using that a lot, maybe Kubrick too in Barry Lindon.
So I would say my colloquial use of the terms is the same as the movies. 
A quick google says in the morning it's reversed (makes sense) with blue pre-rise and golden right after.

Je les emmerde. Je leur souhaite de l'attrapper l'osti de covid et de s'√©touffer avec.
C'est Lucie Laurier qui toute fait √ßa, je l'ai vue
I really can‚Äôt stand these people. I‚Äôm generally pretty patient, but I have none when it comes to this. They‚Äôre all so stupid. I can‚Äôt even understand how they can shit on something they clearly don‚Äôt understand. That‚Äôs some crazy mental gymnastics
ahaha avec les erreurs de conjugaison et de ponctuation, la pancarte lit comme si en effet,  Legault laissait nos enfants respirer, et non comme ‚ÄúLegault, laisses respirer nos enfants!‚Äù. juste un ptit peu ironique.
C'est quoi au juste le nom de leur secte?
Ah more signs of what some called a perfectly peaceful and uneventful protest that in no way interfered with vaccines at that site.  /s
I've learned that if someone has to preface something with they are pro-science, they are about to show you a youtube clip of two ancient and irrelevent doctors in Alberta who think restrictions are bad
je propose qu‚Äôon envoie la facture des d√©dommagements √† la ville de st-j√©r√¥me

I say you should be totally allowed not to get vaccinated.

Pis en plus √ßa se ramasse pas.
La pancarte a raison, c‚Äôest vrai que Legault laisse nos enfants respirer; sans les mesures sanitaires, il y en a beaucoup plus qui aurait des probl√®mes respiratoires en ce moment.
Whenever people spray paint stupid shit, I remember this SNL skit where they talk about the police hiring people who match the handwriting (spraywriting), and add more spray paint to make you look stupid.
In this case, they‚Äôd add ‚ÄúCOVID‚Äù at the end of the first one and ‚Äúnot a‚Äù in front of the second.
Smooth brain time
Parfois je dis √† mes colocs de changer de sujet lorsque l'on parle de √ßa. √áa vient tellement me chercher, √† quel point des gens peuvent √™tre tout simplement 100% straight up dumb as fuck.
La photo de cet article de Radio Canada est juste PAR-FAITE. 
https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1789536/quebec-debout-manifestations-mesures-sanitaires-quebec-montreal-stade-olympique
Les faces... Les slogans... Et m√™me les maths sont On Point.
Dumb AF. 
These people can't be bothered to look up how vaccines saved millions from smallpox/polio.
You all need a hug, can we allow hugs again?
J‚Äôy √©tais. Encore une fois, ya 90% des gens qui √©taient civilis√©s. T‚Äôas tjrs un pourcentage de morons, malheureusement. M√™me si je suis d‚Äôaccord avec le message et que je comprends la frustration, ce graffiti √©tait de trop‚Ä¶
just let those fuckers die, less idiots - better life
Not all protesters are anti science . Some just want to have a choice, a voice.
Fuck these guys.
J'ai une question s√©rieuse: Qui sont ces gens? Tous les Qu√©b√©cois que je connais sont des personnes normales. Je comprends qu'il y a plusieurs Anglo-Canadiens qui regardent Fox News et donc ont √©t√© assimil√©s a la pathologie am√©ricaine, mais les francophones en g√©n√©ral ne sont pas du tout comme √ßa (dans mon exp√©rience).
C'est compl√®tement bizarre.
Il va toujours avoir des √©l√©ments ind√©sirables dans toutes les manifestations. Ce n‚Äôest jamais une repr√©sentation du mouvement complet. Je suis s√ªr que tu serais conscient de ce fait si √ßa aurait √©t√© une manifestation de BLM. Pourrais-tu essayer d‚Äôavoir un peu d‚Äôempathie pour ce mouvement aussi? Tant mieux pour toi si ta vie va encore bien apr√®s avoir √©t√© embarr√© chez toi pour plus d‚Äôun an mais il y a beaucoup de gens qui n‚Äôont pas eu cette chance. Ridiculiser ce mouvement constamment fait juste rendre service au gouvernement qui a, en passant, compl√®tement foir√© tout ce qui touche √† covid de A √† Z. Veux-tu vraiment √™tre un propagandiste pour leur r√©gime?
Im sorry but vaccin kill...
They kill virus .
Yup exactly.. can‚Äôt even protest because of these dumbos
Well, if we wanna talk about science, *some* of the vaccines have caused death and I don‚Äôt think it should be brushed under the carpet. The vector vaccines botched their research on side effects in their rush to produce it as fast as possible. However, the amount of people that will die if we don‚Äôt reach herd immunity will be much greater than those caused by the vaccines. The biggest problem in all of this is that we shouldn‚Äôt have put ourselves in a position where we were this desperate to make compromises and sacrifices. Canada should have AT LEAST been able to take contracts to produce vaccines or even design our own vaccines so we didn‚Äôt have to rely on other countries to so generously sell us theirs.

Imagine: une piscine remplie de vaccin. Un gars tombe dedans, ne sais pas nager et √† 50kg de b√©ton attach√© au pied. Mort √† cause du vaccin. F√™tez recherche.
Yeah, plus most kids do seem to be playing outside? Idk, near me all winter I'd see kids making snowforts, tobogganing or playing pick-up hockey in the alley. They didn't seem too "oppressed." I suppose it was against the rules, but from a pure safety standpoint not too risky since they were outside. 
Some parents no doubt did not let their kids do this, but I can't imagine those would be the same people taking to the streets that the restrictions are too harsh on kids. I think a lot of parents are projecting their own anxiety/fears/stress about their kids/having their kids at home more. 
What do they think happens in other countries afflicted by wars and natural disasters? School and normal life gets interrupted sometimes during extreme events. If the kids aren't fine in a permanent way, it's because of the direct effects of those wars/disasters (deaths/injury of those around them etc.).
Saying to let kids play is exactly implying they don't give a fuck if their kids get covid ... bad parenting all around !
I‚Äôm in highschool and I‚Äôm loving masks because I‚Äôm not confident at all and i think I‚Äôm ugly so i actually hope masks don‚Äôt go to soon
Sounds like you'd like to write some graffiti of your own.
Weren't you a shitty, germy kid at one point? Loving the compassion here.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending vandalism or ignorance which is why this comment seems like the other side of the same coin.
Or even in Quebec. We're not out of it yet, the hardest part is probably behind us but I still see people dying of covid and complications every week..
C'est un vrai Snowdon, le trou est trop petit pour Fairmount / St V
I thought it was a photo at first
If you're not going to tell us what bakery you prefer you might as well not be from Montreal. Regardless, if it's not Fairmount you're wrong.
Fairmount > st viateur dont @ me
Which bakery?
J'ai le go√ªt de brasser d'la marde: est ce que la qualit√© de saint-viateur a diminu√© dans les derni√®res ann√©es?
MTL bagels beat NY bagels. Just saying
What do you mean you painted it? It's the same colour as any other bagel.
(Actually that was a compliment) :D
Looks good enough to eat üòã
Too uniform in shape to be from st-viateur or fair mount - looks like a Toronto bagel to me ;)
Andalos?
It looks appetizing!
Would you mind painting some cream cheese to go with it?
Your painting skills are delicious!
I just like bagels and smoked meat, I didn't expect this to be so controversial.
wow, looks like a picture! very talented!
You painted this?
Obsessed with all your work!
C'est pas mauvais des bagels, mais j'ai jamais compris pourquoi c'est un si gros m√©me.
Wow.
Don't get into any bakery at the moment.  There's a pandemic!
Selling prints?
I like how Montreal‚Äôs only dish is either poutine or bagel. 
Aim a little higher maybe
J‚Äôallais dire Ville √âmard certainement lol
A hot Fairmount sesame on the walk home with a bagful under my arm is my dream afternoon.
the only right answer here no cap
Jla comprend pas celle ca. Jveux pas m'obstiner jveux juste comprendre. Me semble que les St-Viateurs sont plus savoureux, non? Si tu prends une bouch√©e de chaque une apr√®s l'autre le Fairmount est d√©finitivement plus fade. C'est l'impression que j'ai, en tout cas.
It is of course from the unanimously preferred bagel place: <insert bakery of choice>
I used to be a st viateur person but man... It is hard to defend them as the best anymore. Even Bagel Brossard has gotten me on board now! Fairmount is better now... 
I've noticed a significant drop in the last 5 years at Viateur, and their retail bagels are noticeably not as good as their in-house ones.
u my dear friend, have said dangerous words in the montreal sub, u have two choices and toronto ain‚Äôt one
Yes indeed!
That's bloody incredible. (*Applause*).
J‚Äôai rien a apporter a la discussion sur les bagels mais ton accent dans le mot meme me donne envie de flipper une table.
yes please dm me on instagram @erinrothstein
How high should Montreal aim? What are Ottawa‚Äôs popular dishes?
Because Fairmount bagel is open 24h, so if you have a hankering for a 3am bagel (pre lockdown) they can hook you up
Next let‚Äôs discuss smoked meat üëçüëç
Retail bagels occasionally come burnt now and sadly I can taste it. I'm a die hard st v fan but I must agree I've had some sad bagels from them lately.
Brossard bagels are the best on the south shore by far. Nothing better than eating them fresh out of the bag when they‚Äôre still warm.
Real bagel says hi lol
Un m√©m√©.
As a former Ottawan... Shawarma I guess? Honestly Ottawa-Gatineau has some great bagel (Kettlemans, Cadmans, Ottawa Bagel Shop) and poutine (Fritomania, Pataterie Hulloise, Patate Lou-Lou) places too, idk anyone there who would shit on bagels & poutine
Ottawa never claimed to have a famous dish
The Main obviously. Next!
>Un m√©m√©.
This is the best thread on this post by far
Happy cake dayyyy
Fully agree! Best smoke meat and poutine I‚Äôve had in Mtl so far.
Omg no!!! Even Dunn‚Äôs smoked meat is better than The Main. I suppose next you‚Äôre going to tell me that Cote St Luc chicken is better than Chalet BBQ... üö´
Oh wow thanks! You too! I had no idea ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Me neither, I posted a puppy pic at last minute. Had to reap that sweet karma
*Nous sommes en 2025, Tout le monde en parle termine sa 20e saison.*
*Guy A Lepage: "Nous accueillons ce soir Denis Coderre qui vient nous pr√©senter son nouveau livre 'Montr√©al √ßa pue pis c'est laitte; une lettre d'amour √† la m√©tropole'. Denis, la question qui tue. Allez-vous-tu vous pr√©senter √† la mairie?"*  
*Denis Coderre: "Eh bien Guy A. J'ai chang√©. Et oui, je vais me pr√©senter √† la mairie pour vous montrer √† quel point j'ai chang√©"*
He said he would stick around as opposition leader this time, always full of shit.
Sauf erreur, il n'a toujours pas prononc√© les mots : "f√©licitations √† Val√©rie Plante pour sa victoire".
&#x200B;
C'est quand m√™me tout qu'un orgeuilleux pareil. Il est encore en train de bl√¢mer les m√©dias ou ses adversaires ou je sais pas trop au lieu de dire bravo et de r√©ellement passer √† autre chose.

Attitude de merde.
Edit : erreur de ma part, il a rapidement dit bravo en d√©but se discours avant de se lancer dans ses √¢neries habituelles.

J'esp√®re que c'est vrai cette fois-ci !
C o m p √© t e n t
Denis Coderre never wanted to serve the community, all he wanted was to serve himself.
K. Bye.
Il quitte pour se concentrer sur son prochain livre: Reretrouver Montr√©al.
*¬´ Je les aime ¬ª, a-t-il dit. ¬´ C‚Äôest un extraordinaire livre qui se termine, mais fort de cette exp√©rience-l√†, je peux faire beaucoup d‚Äôautres choses, \[‚Ä¶\] tant sur la sc√®ne internationale, locale ou ailleurs. ¬ª*
My French isn't the best, trying to understand what could be *ailleurs* in this case. If not local nor international, where then?
Parole d'un ami: "Denis Coderre qui annonce son retrait de la vie politique, c'est comme Broue qui annonce sa derni√®re tourn√©e."
Womp womp.
Edit: I'm coming to dislike politicians with increasing intensity the older I get. But Mr. Coderre is at another level - the very sight of him, especially in those stupid fucking glasses he's adopted to hip himself up, makes me want to go vote against him all over again. He didn't deserve to govern and I'm beyond glad he lost. Hopefully he can pack up that ridiculously oversized ego of his and find a dumber electorate far from here to try and swindle.
He actually promised he wouldn't do like last time and would stick around. So much for that pledge.

I'm sure it was entirely his decision, and not the will of the city.

Where was this photo taken?
It‚Äôs fucking RAW!
I prefer medium rare Montreal
I love this city
Since when does Le 1000 have red lights on it?
Depuis le Mont Royal?
Je pensais que c‚Äô√©tait une r√©f√©rence √† la WWE √† Montr√©al
I wanted a picture like this for a long time. Thank you
Nice, just finished a 1000 piece puzzle of the same view!
Magnifique !
Fuckin greatest city in the world!
Epic Colors! Which camera and lens did you use?
Le vert √† gauche c'est Desjardins. Notre fleuron national depuis 120 ans.  Soyons fiert!

So I just got the 12 pro max. What exactly is the RAW feature and how do I maximize its use?
Fix the WB first hehe
Huh shi you have a point, i usually shoot raw so i didn‚Äôt bother checking lmao, that sucks D: now i wanna see what you‚Äôd of done >~<
Where is there a mural of Cohen? The only mural I know of downtown  is the one of Bourdain
Out of frame, j‚Äôai une autre photo avec cela mais c‚Äô√©tait pas si beau que ce que j‚Äôai poster. Si tu le veut je peut te l‚Äôenvoyer
I think it is taken from Chalet du Mont-Royal
Monday night
Personally more of a medium-well done my self but everyone kept telling me to try raw, so this was the result
Ok.
It's been like for at least the last couple of weeks
Du belv√©d√®re Kondiaronk fort probablement, je reconnais l'angle et on voit des branches en bas √† gauche.
Photo prise lundi soir
Glad I helped with that then! :D
There puzzles for everything huh lmao, I‚Äôm def too impatient for that so kudos
Fujifilm X-T20 with the 18-55mm lens it came with lmao
RAW pretty much lets you edit the shadows and highlights post-process better. Not sure about how it works on phones though, but id think its the same thing
[Here's](https://i.imgur.com/xjYy4g8.jpg) a quick edit I did in iPhoto. With night photos like these I usually boost the shadows, lower the highlights and cool the temperature in Lightroom. Anyway, it's a great shot!
You can see it to the right of this picture  https://imgur.com/gallery/jALgdeH    
im not sure on which street it is
This, or more specifically ‚ÄúDu Belv√©d√®re Kondiaronk‚Äù at its lookout in front of this chalet looking place

Do they change colour?

Yeah I got the phone mainly for photography and that kind of thing. On a Mac, you have some editing tools to recommend? On the free or cheap side?
wowwww OK that's so so good, really pretty and so much better .0. NOW I RLLY WISH IT WAS RAW AAAAAAAAAAAA
Crescent Street
Oh I thought it was taken from the rooftop of cinema l'amour
Oh how wonderful thanks I just bought a dozen, looking to finish at least 1 before covid ends! ( ¬¥‚àÄÔΩÄ)
I wish i could but I‚Äôm not very experienced on the post processing side of things, i just use Photoshop (that i got cracked for free), and the free version of Lightroom on my iPad with some other random apps sometimes, but that more for portrait type stuff. For landscape and most things if not all, just photoshop. Wish i could give a better answer but i do know there are definitely a ton of great apps on mobile and Mac for free so you can look around, when i was taking pics from my iPhone, i got pretty nice edited results through just the in camera editor, so just play around with it lmao
If anyone who knows their way around different editing apps, do leave your suggestions n stuff ^^
I wish I had that kind of access!
Only a dozen? Hopefully you can combine them for even more fun :D
Loool

So beautiful. One thing that is cool about montreal is how old buildings such as churches can add a lot to an otherwise relatively single height area of town.
Awesome picture. That's my Montreal.
I believe that's tier clock tower on Laurier in Outremont at the bottom too right?
Beautiful
My ‚ù§Ô∏è
I can see my flat from there, such a nice picture. Walking on Saint-Viateur when the sun sets is amazing.
[deleted]
I just moved into this neighborhood yesterday!  Thanks for the beautiful picture!
Where did you shoot this from?
Had a friend recommend it to me after, installed it but haven't used it yet since I only use the metro for my commute
Recommended!
Yep it is
Church of St Michael and Anthony on the left (google maps just calls it "Polish Church" lol) and Saint √âdouard church on the right.
From the North-eastern lookout on Mont Royal
It has subway time prediction too
Thanks - Nice shot.
Buona Festa di San Giuseppe!
Vendredi, le 19 mars, nous c√©l√©brons la f√™te de Saint-Joseph. Voici une photo de u/simonlachapelle de L'Oratoire Saint-Joseph, la plus grande √©glise au monde d√©di√©e au culte de Saint-Joseph et la plus grande √©glise au Canada. 
Voici une interpr√©tation du canticle qu'on chante √† la fin de chaque messe, chant√©e dans la crypte de L'Oratoire : 
[Noble √âpoux de Marie, digne objet de nos chants! notre c≈ìur t'en supplie, veille sur tes enfants!](https://youtu.be/Dfkb86ArJcA)
C'est quoi √ßa la f√™te de Saint-Joseph?? Genuinely curious I've never heard of this before.
Histoire personnelle : notre c√©r√©monie de remise de dipl√¥mes √©tait √† l'oratoire Saint-Joseph au secondaire m√™me si notre √©cole √©tait dans Rosemont. la joke c'est que le coll√®ge Notre-Dame, nos grands rivaux surtout au football √©tait directement de l'autre c√¥t√© de la rue.
On peut √™tre ath√© et quand m√™me appr√©cier l'apport de l'oratoire imo.
All sorts of cool. Great shot :)
The guy is apart of my family lineage, always a cool fact no one believes :)
This is absolutely stunning! Great photo!

La clart√© de la photo. ü§©
Anche a te e buona festa del pap√† a chi la vuole festegiarre oggi, si facciamo une mangiata di Zeppole  üòâ
C'est le temps l√† pour ceux qui veulent se gater aujourd'hui d'aller s'achet√© des Zeppole aujourd'hui √† leur patisserie Italienne pr√©f√©r√©.
The Catholic and Orthodox churches, we have saints (ordinary people who have led holy lives and are in heaven and whom we implore for help). Throughout the year, we celebrate these saints on special days. Saint Patrick's feast day is on March 17 (normally associated with the Irish, green beer, and the NYC police department). Another famous feast day is Saint Valentine, whose feast day is on February 14. La f√™te de Saint-Jean-Baptiste is another feast day. And Christmas is one of Jesus' many feast days.
Saint Joseph's feast day, while it hasn't been secularized to the same extent as other saints, is a very important feast day for the Church, as he is a very important figure.
I hope that helps
je ne sais pas ou il font la remise des dipl√¥mes maintenant, mais on n'allais rarement a l'oratoire, la relation des fr√®res vs les p√®res de sainte-croix n‚Äô√©tait pas la meilleure.
Savais pas que Rosemont √©tait notre plus grand rival, j'pensais que s'√©tait R√©gina.
Probably due to the fact his actual historicity is totally unconfirmed.
Just saying, you might start there before making further claims.
Ouais non je connais les f√™tes de St Patrick, P√¢ques, No√´l pis toute la gang c'est juste que la f√™te de St-Joseph on en entend jamais parl√©, ou du moins c'est pas c√©l√©br√© ni un jour f√©ri√©. Si c'est un jour important pour the Church c'est visiblement pas aussi important que No√´l ou Vendredi Saint.
Si c'est pas un jour f√©ri√©, pour moi c'est pas important lol
*Jean-eudes
Si on parle football et classement des √©coles secondaire. Bah c'√©tait dans mon temps surtout!
Je pense qu'il parle du fr√®re Andr√©, pas de Joseph le p√®re de J√©sus. Le fr√®re Andr√©, il a exist√©...
Yeaaah je parle du fr√®re Andr√© lol, qui est bel et bien confirm√© dans la g√©n√©alogie de ma famille haha but yeah, you are right regardless
Oui, effectivement ce n'est pas plus important que P√¢ques ni No√´l, et culturellement la f√™te n'est pas c√©l√©br√©e comme les f√™tes de Saint-Patrick pour les irlandais ou Saint-Jean pour les franco-canadiens. 
C'est pourquoi j'ai publi√© cette cool photo, pour c√©l√©brer L'Oratoire et donner l'√©clairage √† son patron.
Understatement de l'ann√©e, "il a exist√©" haha.
Edit parce que je suis pas claire quand je parle, je me moque pas, le understatement m'a fait rire quand on pense √† tout ce qu'il a fait, √† tous les gens qui consid√®re lui devoir leur vie ou bien-√™tre, √† l'oratoire qui remplace son cabanon et sa saint-ification (j'ai oubli√© le terme) malgr√© qu'on l'appel quand m√™me fr√®re Andr√©. Pas mal √©pique le bonhomme.
Bingooo hahaha
Ah le fr√™re huileux.... c'est pas mal plus logique!
Exact, tu vois pour nous les Italiens c'est assez gros donc c'est culturelle en effet.
Comme j'ai dis pr√©c√©demment au moins tout le monde ici en peut tir√© profit avec de bonne Zeppole √† manger.
Int√©ressant merci pour l'info!!
On va se le dire, y'a pas mal moins d'incitatifs commerciaux qui fait que la grosse bizness souligne pas la Saint-Joseph comme elle le fait pour d'autre... 
Si y'a pas moyen de s'faire de l'argent pour les capitalistes, on s'en sacre, on dirait!
Sauf que ‚Äúexister‚Äù c‚Äôest binaire: tu existes ou tu n‚Äôexistes pas.  Tu peux pas understater l‚Äôexistence...
On va faire ensemble "la personne plate du party". Le terme peut √™tre binaire dans sa forme, √ßa ne veut pas dire que son utilisation dans une phrase et dans une langue et culture lui octroie un sens binaire √† l'utilisation. 
Les mots et les phrases ont davantage de sens que leur simple d√©finissons du dictionnaires. Dans le contexte pr√©sent, il exprimait exister de sorte √† s'opposer √† un personnage pr√©sum√© fictif. Dans ma r√©ponse, je suppose que exister est un terme trop simple pour d√©crire la vie d'un homme devenu saint, puisque parfois dans la langue, d√©crire qu'une personne existe peut √™tre aussi interpr√©t√© de sorte qu'elle n'a fait que √ßa, sans aucune caract√©ristique int√©ressante √† sa vie.
Winter is coming.
It looks like it‚Äôs cold just from the light and clouds.
Lots of people take our city for granted but truly, Montreal is beautiful.
Tr√®s belle composition !
Wow, elle est incroyable!
Very nice.
I had cause to visit 900 de Maisonneuve (the glass building at left) last year. The view looking south from the upper floors is simply amazing.
Our quaint little metropolis
Phenomenal!
Nice photo.  I miss Montreal!
I thought there was snow on the roof for a sec there ><
Beautiful picture
wowüòç great picture!
Wow
I‚Äôm stealing that pic
Gorgeous!
Put that shit away.
It's the editing actually, i took the picture with a drone so i had go through some color correction and added a bit of a "cold" vibe. Glad you noticed anyway!
Man our city has a vibe you won't find it anywhere else
It definitely has a vibe and is a beautiful but I had been destroyed by construction, bad management and corruption. I appreciate Montreal as a visitor but cannot live there ever again.
Mercii
Merci, √ßa fait plaisir‚Äâ!
I‚Äôm happy to say I installed most of the windows on that building.
La tour Manuvie? T'as des photos?
Nice job, dude.
Fun fact: 900 de Maisonneuve West doesn't have any underground parking. It does have 5 or 6 storeys of it above ground though.
That's the one. Sadly, no, my mind was on other things that day. Maybe u/Mind-Against can arrange one for us?
The novel perspective on all the classic buildings surrounding Dorchester Square combined with a clear view all the way down to the river is quite stunning.

I'm planing to go downtown kater on to get more shots, I'll take one for you. Let me know how you want it
Anything approximating what I described above would be wonderful, thank you. The little alley between 900 and Simon's should be quiet on a Sunday afternoon. Good luck!

My shift is 3pm till 11:30pm Mon-Fri.  I got all the necessary documentation from my work last Friday stating why I would be out past curfew and I assumed that would have been enough.
Now I gotta worry about some cop having a bad day and having to waste a day in court fighting a 1000+ dollar fine on top of my day to day bullshit at work!
Je comprends rien honn√™tement
Instead of the authorization letters they may as well give out uno reverse cards.
Le fameux "jugement" des policiers.
The curfew should have had very very precise rules to make sure we protect people. Is the point of the curfew to prevent parties or to fuck with nurses and warehouse workers? At this point I will be shocked if they win the next election. I do not understand anymore, the curfew was put in place to prevent parties but aren't parties illegal anyway?
Yay ma peur! I'm an essential workers since I work at a pharmacy and my boss is scheduling us to end at 8h30pm because "yOu NeEd ThAt MuCh TiMe To dO ThE jOb" which we don't we can start earlier. So now I'm gonna be fucked on the way home even though I'm in uniform and I have signed letter from work. I told him the letter meant nothing but what does he care? Sorry for the rant I just hate when everyone tells you your nuts for worrying about something and then it happens -_-
il y a √©galement celle qui s'est fait fouiller son sac √† lunch : 
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/monreal-police-quebec-curfew-1.5870961?cmp=rss
du beau powertrip
Has common sense and not to mention intelligence gone out the window amongst provincial authorities in Quebec?
I swear last night I was out at around 7:30 and I saw this woman run out from what looked like her place of work into the street and almost get hit by a car. She then got in her own car and sped off. I swear people are afraid of being caught out and people are going to get hurt.
Police will be reasonable, is not a plan.
Now just imagine all the time and money wasted when all these tickets are contested in court and ultimately overturned.
Silly person, cops will only accept a notarized authorization letters in triplicate, and it will only be available on the 2nd floor between 2pm and 3:30pm, when you have form 2B. 
To get form 2B, wait in line for Schedule TKT, which is only available on Mondays, between 9:30 and 9:45am!
THEN, the cops will use their "discretion" to deem if your letter is valid or not in the future!!
Why am I not surprised?
Un petit rappel public que l'administration de Montreal a augment√© le budget du SPVM. Just what everyone needs.
Everytime you give extra powers to the police they get abused.
Welcome to tyranny. Don't get expect this to end soon, or ever.
And now those people have to go to court and potentially spread the virus.
J'√©tais en vacances, je commence ma premi√®re nuit de samedi √† dimanche (23h45-9h), je vais avoir mon papier rendu l√†.
Je vais avoir ma carte d'employ√©, mais √ßa va bien me taper si je me fais coller une contravention.
"Tu vas o√π?"
"Je fais les test COVID"
J'esp√®re que j'aurai pas √† aller plus loin que √ßa...
Literally asking for your papers just for being outside on the streets. 
I am reminded of "Are we the baddies?".
>Prato said it is up to citizens to prove they're allowed to be out after curfew.
It says you have to "establish" that you're out for an exempted reason, but obviously it's not right to interpret that as requiring people to prove it, because there are several exemptions that are impossible to prove. For example, you can go to the drugstore. How do you prove you're on your way to the drugstore?
I *dare* a backwater cop to try to ticket me with my documentation. Like do they think *I* want to be at work? No. But it is what it is. Any power tripping cops will be met with complaints and I will fight any ticket I unlawfully receive by those oikers.
Nos policiers sont form√©s √† la militaire. Suivre les ordres et non pas faire preuve de jugement et de discernement.
L√† on leur demande exactement √ßa. 
Certains policiers en sont capables mais de ce que je vois depuis les derniers 15 ans √† Mtl, c'est pas la majorit√©.
C'est donc certain qu'il y aura une pile de ces contraventions qui seront injustifi√©es.
That didnt take long
Ceci m'est arriv√©, avant le couvre-feu. Vive les policiers de Magog haha
I hope all the doctors and nurses that have been calling for curfews are happy with themselves.
As a **direct** result of these disturbing stories coming out of Quebec, I will no longer be supporting *some* of the measures being used to fight this virus in Canada. It has become clear to me that *some* of these measures are not about controlling the virus. I am still going to wear my mask, and avoid large gatherings, but these developments in Quebec have made me a lot more skeptical about some measures. I will definitely not support a curfew anywhere else in Canada including in my province of British Columbia, and I will no longer be supporting Doug Ford‚Äôs new stay-at-home measures in Ontario.
Doctors and nurses, it‚Äôs your turn to defend what is happening in Quebec.
Fucked
This sucks! I do food delivery would normally work later into the  evening as it is often the busiest. I havent worked past curfew yet though, even though i would be technically aloud to, for this very reason. I dont trust the police to not use good judgment and give me a ticket anyways ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Lol just uno reverse card the cop for also being out past curfew
Police is a punitive organization by its nature. Serve and protect my ass. Police units have a [certain quota on how many infractions](https://www.ctvnews.ca/w5/are-police-handing-out-traffic-tickets-to-meet-quotas-1.1129762) they need to register per shift. This kills all common sense and it's no longer about the spirit of the law. So this should come as a no surprise when they hand over tickets to people waiting for a bus after an evening shift with a letter from their employer in the pocket. And it might not stop here. Now these people will need to wait at least a year to contest the ticket before the judge, probably take an unpaid day off for that and who knows what will be the decision. We need body cameras on every on-duty policeman and community driven body that reviews complaints and can dismiss an officer if necessary. Police should never investigate itself.
Good thing we brought on 100 extra police for this. Sounds like they're doing a great job as always.
Where we moving boys
So what can we do? Who can we call to make complaints to? How can we ensure that these people get their tickets immediately dismissed? How can we ensure that these police officers face consequences? If anyone has any ideas or resources let me know
The problem is we should never give police more power, because many of them are clueless ego driven idiots.
Fucking. Insane.
Stupid useless cops. Get rid of the morons.
Disgusting
What a mess!
I mean from the article there‚Äôs a chance the cop messed up and there‚Äôs a chance there‚Äôs more to the story we don‚Äôt know about.
To be fair though, Good Food is replacing the essential role of the supermarket and should be treated as such, with employees finishing at 7:30 at the latest.
I think if you're walking outside with a coworker after work, you still need to keep 6 feet apart. Probably these guys were all together in the bus shelter ir maybe smoking a joint after work.
BUT SHE DID NOT GET FINES, because... I can read the article but I guess that /u/poligonal can't? (The video also does not talk about getting fines).
Edit: see below for follow up.
Maybe, just maybe the workers were asked to explain why they were breaking curfew and refused to do so resulting in a fine.  We don't have half the story here. This is the perfect example of media trying to scare/frustrate people. Big title, no content, no context, empty article
Not sure if you're referring to the workers in this article or front line workers in general - but the victims in this case are not *that* kind of front line worker.
Keep the good work my friend. I hope these are isolated cases and won't happen anymore.
Would it be possible to sue the police department or the officer himself for damages? They are knowingly and maliciously handing out phony tickets after all.
Je crois que tant que t'as une lettre √©crite de ton employeur ainsi que le document te permettant d'√™tre dehors durant le couvre-feu que tu peux attacher √† ton ticket dans ta lettre de contestation, tu ne passeras probablement m√™me pas en cour.
bin l√† ils se fient aux jugement des policiers... moi je suis pas surpris.
Give police more power, watch police abuse said power.
We are all on a need-to-know basis only. 
Carry on now, nothing to see here, moving right along.
> Je comprends rien honn√™tement
En fait, ce n'est pas vous qui ne comprenez pas, mais plut√¥t la police...
Hi all. I made a map of existing and (actively) planned rapid transit in your lovely city, which I thought I would share.
[deleted]
Yess! J'ai vraiment h√¢te de voir ca! Par contre, comme n'importe quelle promesse, je vais me r√©jouir uniquement quand je le verrais de mes yeux :P 
mais on s'en va dans la bonne direction!
I still can't get over how they forgot to link the REM with VIA at Dorval.
Sad to see that the entire Lachine and southern/western Lasalle areas continue to be super underserved by rapid transit.
En esp√©rant que tu oublie le tramway de Lachine.
There's a ton to be excited about in our transit future, but I have to say it's frustrating how we're pouring tens of billions into serving outer-ring suburbs, with little attention paid to improving transit in the central urban neighborhoods. (Credit where it's due, Mayor Plante's platform acknowledged this issue and proposed a huge investment that got flatly denied by our lovely provincial government, so a lot of the blame sits with the National Assembly.)
As the confinement restrictions wind down, key bus routes and the Orange Line will be overflowing again, and while the REM is great, I think it's mostly going to attract new riders (and existing exo train riders) rather than relieve capacity issues for the STM.
I'm not saying it has to be the Pink Line specifically, either--why not resurrect and update the tramway proposals from last decade? Why not propose more SRB lines like we're building on Pie-IX? Heck, why not just do really dumb boring basic stuff on a bunch of major bus routes: off-board fare payment kiosks, more signal priority, more permanent bus lanes (instead of part-time parking lanes), stop consolidations, higher frequencies, etc. Why aren't there even scraps and crumbs available for the most transit-dependent, highest-ridership neighborhoods?
Nice map! There‚Äôs a typo for Acadie metro station.
Est-ce que EXO= Trains de banlieue AMT?
Nice Map!   
Il y a le projet √† Longueuil aussi que tu pourrais incorporer! https://leeo.longueuil.quebec/
By the way, have people seen this? Arguably a better version of my map, although it doesn't include REM de l'Est.
[https://www.mtlblog.com/en-ca/news/montreal/montreals-public-transit-network-map-of-the-future-shown-in-new-design-from-artm](https://www.mtlblog.com/en-ca/news/montreal/montreals-public-transit-network-map-of-the-future-shown-in-new-design-from-artm)
That's great! Weren't they planning on making Canora an intermodal station with the St-J√©r√¥me train line?
Edit: Just found this [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/5flln9/rem_station_canora/) about it. According to CDPQ Infra, the ARTM will have to make this decision.
I thought there would be more coming for the west :(
Thanks, this does look quite good and follows the usual visual design of the metro well.
I guess the most prominent design difference from the official maps is that this one has to be viewed at a pretty large scale to read details well. I'm not sure how any official maps will ever manage that trick honestly, with so many different lines coming together. The whole thing gets crowded fast.
As a purely selfish wish since I live in that area, I do wonder what it would look like with the SRB Pie-IX line added to it. It's questionable whether it will really count as rapid transit, but it happens to be directly relevant to my own daily life.
Tr√®s belle carte. √áa saute aux yeux que C√¥te-Vertu et Bois-Francs doivent √™tre connect√©s... dans les 2 premi√®res ann√©es de fermeture de la ligne deux-montagne, c'est devenu stupidement √©vident...
Also, aside from the need to link C√¥te-Vertu and Bois-Francs... the need for a big circle around all that will arise in the next 20-30 years... it won't all be to and from downtown anymore... I worked there 10+ years, and don't know if I will go back.
Ndg and lachone sit forgotten in a corner
Nice map!! Doubt I'll be letting go of my car to get in from the West-Island, but still nice to see that finally Mtl transit is modernizing!
Absolutely wonderful, it really illustrates how another REM line out west close to the 720 is the missing piece of the puzzle!
C‚Äôest si magnifique!
Apr√®s 50 ans sans changements majeurs, enfin les choses se passent
 *Cogne du bois pour que √ßa se passe pour vrai*
Salut! Est ce que la REM va connecter a la gare centrale? Les petits ponts blanc sont ou les gens pourront "connecter" a la STM?
Pendant longtemps j'ai penser qu'il manque une autre fa√ßon de se rendre downtown des quatre coins de Montr√©al. J'esp√®re que √ßa va aider le crowding qu'il y a...
Well I have to go to Mtl one of these days. I‚Äôm from Mtl! I was a yun‚Äôun when Henri-Boubou was built. Ahuntsic
It would be nice if you can add the SRB-Pie-IX on the map.
How does this not extend to Dorval station? Such a dumb decision, they better make a clear path from the Terminus to the airport stop
I see that you have other public transit systems on your website, any others that you find are good inspirations, especially in the North American context?
I always thought that adding the canal and aqueduc as waterways to this map would help people understand the south west more.  They are basically compasses.
I wonder how many different options they are considering for the southwest around the canal . Would they use exisiting trains through NDG and Vendome to connect the airport while having a nice tram from maybe guy down towards the canal that goes through little burgundy/griffintown, and then go on the canal, stop at atwater, gabdois, the new park, vsp/lachine est, to dorval.  Do they only stay on the north side of the canal, do they have plans to build new neighbourhoods replacing st patrick ville emard/eastern lasalle area's industrial area.  they could have a simple bridge to cross to get to transit.  and how about the eastern (nothern) tip of cote st paul between the highway and canal?  I believe you could make some nice developments, some multi family housing for sure, parks, shops, and a huge market would be so perfect for the area.  de la verendrye was extended to the canal and is beautiful, with protected bike lanes, 2 driving lanes and wide sidewalks.  That huge spray painted dump warehouse is zoned for a community centre online (i hope a market) I think there is something big cooking.
With 70 000 projected daily users and its 17 stations, the bus rapid transit (BRT) on Pie-IX boulevard is not negligible as well. The boulevard is currently stripped on its whole length. [Here's the wiki link with some info](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_bus_rapid_transit)
Je trouve qu‚Äôil manque encore ‚Äúle diagonal‚Äù √† travers le plateau/Rosemont
It's so beautiful. Plz build fast
I think after all of this is built, the southwestern/west central portion of Montreal around NDG/C√¥te-st-luc/LaSalle/Lachine will be the most underserved areas of the agglomeration. Hopefully the next project will be some sort of REM Southwest or an extension of the blue line.
You should include the BRT Pie IX rapid bus line
Liteally everywhere exept where my family lives
Damn, i was born on Haig street... Kinda weird to see it on the map
This is amazingly done and so clean! Will this be used by the STM in the future?
Maintenant? Ou √† venir?
The ‚ÄúGriffintown-Bernard-laundry‚Äù takes the cake.  He lived in Outremont.  Rename that station.
It is absolutely ridiculous that we don't have a metro stop at the Airport yet.
is this official?
Maybe I'm just pessimist, but there are a few of these that I'm firmly in the "I'll believe it when I see it" camp.
I hope it all happens! Because that is one gorgeous network üòç
The light blue line is gonna be trashy as hell
You can also get to angrignon by taking a exo bus way up from valleyfield
When‚Äôs A2 line opening? anyone?
[deleted]
2 id√©es ... (bullet point power)  
* La boucle de la Ligne Orange devrait √™tre termin√©e. (mon pet peeve) 
* La Ligne Bleue pourrait √™tre √©tendue de Snowdon jusqu'√† Angrignon
   * soit en faire 1 seule ligne bleue/verte.
   * soit en faire 2 lignes avec changement de ligne √† Angrignon.
One day they might continue the green line into Lachine
Je trouve que le bout qui est parall√®le √† la ligne verte vers l'est est inutile. J'aurais fait passer au milieu de l'√Æle, pas sur Notre-Dame.
I remember when the metro was built: Ahuntsic just b4 Expo 67. Something weird happened. 
We still had tramways and electric buses. Even had a terminus ( Ahuntsic) where we could stay warm w wood burning. Very small. Henri-Bourassa wasn‚Äôt built yet, was a lane for trams and 1 for cars.
All I can say is that I'll vote for whichever mayoral candidate that will promise to build a bridge from l'Ile-Bizard to Sainte-Doroth√©e.
On the blue line extension, are those the official stations   names?
So with suburbs like pointo getting connected, i expect land prices to go up. Right now 1 hour to go downtown is hell, but if that can be 40 minutes instead that would be a huge improvement.
C‚Äôest la Fanfare de l‚Äô√Æle! Ils se prom√®nent dans les parcs et ruelles de MTL. Ce sont des musiciens de plusieurs bands diff√©rents (principalement jazz swing), qui se sont mis √† jouer dans les ruelles l‚Äô√©t√© pass√©e.
Je crois que c‚Äôest la Fanfare de l‚ÄôIle!
Les "Shut the fuck up j'travaille de nuit"
Nice that that was allowed in that borough (unless it wasn't). 
We're trying to organise events (deambulatoire) and we don't have the ok from the borough here in rosemont-petitepatrie.

Super le fun √ßa! Moi l‚Äôautre jour c‚Äô√©tait une chorale qui pratiquait dans la ruelle üòÑ

Maybe the Van Hornies?
√áa ressemble au genre de band qui se prom√®ne dans les rue de Nouvelle-Orl√©ans.

Hehe j‚Äôai pas l‚Äôimpression que les gens demandent dans Hochelag‚Äô.

C‚Äôest cool et √ßa m‚Äô√©tonnerait que les gens s‚Äôen plaigne.
Why? Its technically not an event if it constitutes of a spontaneous music act no ? I live in la petite pat too and i would love to see that here btw <3
Quelques-uns des m√™mes musiciens, mais un different band :)
not sure why you're getting downvoted
Dude j'etais dans mon jardin l'an dernier et un jour j'ai vu quelqu'un habiller en pere noel sur le top d'un truck passer dans la ruelle en jouant de la musique de noel a plein volume. Tu restes surpris mais ca faites ma journee! surtout en temps de pandemie. Vu dans Hochelaga.
s‚Äôila viennent plus que une fois dans ma ruelle jme plaindrais. osti dmusique de cul
Yeah, it's lovely and I'd sure love to see it happen here but we gotta play by the rules. Can't risk getting everyone a fine even if there's a low chance. 
Hopefully the borough gives the OK!

Yeah no worries. I tried to do the same and Googled it
It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ been a long time since a photographer posted here.
everyone"s sleeping right now but wow!  that's a great shot!
what did you like the most?  anything that surprised you?  how much poutine did you eat?
What did you find most amazing about it ?
Bonjour, Hi! 
Awesome shot, my friend.
Grain is looking amazing, great pic
So very cool, thank you for sharing and happy you enjoyed our lovely city!
Love film! that grain seems a bit... much? what film is it / how do you process it ?
Film wow impressive
Is that not a thing people do?   If people didn't post photos on /r/vancouver it would just become a complaint board.
YA EU UNE AUTRE FUSILLADE A MONTR√âAL AUJOURD'HUI
Is that better? /s
I've eaten at tons of 2 and 3 star resteraunts in japan but mon lapin blew my mind best service and amazing amazing food. Iate 6 poutine in 4 days.  The one from la poule Mouill√©e was the best Imo.  I love walking around and taking photos and reconnecting with greeks.  My parents married In Montreal in the 70s before moving to Vancouver.  The church there did me a favour since my mother has passed and I was having difficulty finding documents for my greek citizenship, so I went in person to pay them for sending me my parents wedding certificate 6 months ago.
My favourite thing about Montreal was how friendly everyone was.  And being able to ride my bicycle around the f1 track. 
I will definetly return.
Also I shot this same shot on a film that turns greens Purple.  2 rolls are stuck in my cameras with shots left but here is 1 roll I finished https://twitter.com/MeowjinBoo/status/1437648190501621763?s=19
friendly people!  Food!  Bicycle!  There seemed to be a nightlife!
Fpp retrochrome.  Essentially expired government kodachrome 1600h.
Also i use the lab here in Vancouver which charges me about 11 a roll for e6 and 8 for c41. Then is cna using a Epson flatbed scanner.  I'm also buying a 50mm macro so I scan using my Nikon z6.
We‚Äôre essentially either shitposting or engaged in perpetual comment warfare over some dumb article. A good photo is definitely appreciated. 
Also I don‚Äôt know about the film you used but I gotta congratulate you on that exposition, most digital cams I know would have burned the shit out of the biosphere. Fun to see someone really use the fact film stores more info in whites than blacks, contrary to digital, makes a great image!
Happy to see some people still use film for photography.
You should submit your picture to the banner contest in Montreal sub.
Mon Lapin remains the best meal I‚Äôve had in this city. Excellent choice!
> Iate 6 poutine in 4 days.
Oh my. That's... a lot.
I thought kodachrome is impossible to develop ?
Digital is too sharp now a days.  People are starting to buy pro mist filters which purposely diffuse the image to make it less sharp.
Don't get me wrong, I still shoot tons of digital, but there is something amazingly enjoyable about shooting film.
Easily deserving of a star.
sorry ektachrome 1600h
I still have a Pentax Asahi just need a repair. But film still have the feeling of i should don‚Äôt waste a picture.
amazing, btw there are some amazing film stores still open here in Montreal. Phototek and Studio argentique have hundreds of film cameras for sale. Photo St-Denis offers almost same day dev+scan and Borealis is known all over Canada for being one of the best film labs for slide film.
Yes exactly!  It gives me more time to recompose my photos and make sure i really wanna talk the photo before I shoot it.  My best work is produced that way.  
Are there shops in montreal that repair cameras?  What's wrong with yours?
I have one to SP1000
oh I had no idea, I was trying to do so much in 3 days.  I'm still slowly releasing the photos i shot on film, but how does 1 lab differ from the other for slide film?  "The Lab" here in vancouver I believe develops a ton of a cinema stuff still, and they are the go to for alot of the movie studios here.

some more from the retrochrome i shot. I wish I had 2 more days in montreal, but I'll save it for next year.
I contacted some shop for it. They kind of expensive.And all i know about the camera problem it‚Äôs. I was with 2 friends at Mont Tremblant and one of them probably drop it. I still keep it as an artefacts. I buy the camera 5$ in a yard sale. I did good pictures with.
Basically they are quick, have the best equipment to develop and scan and offer a variety of options both for prints and scans. 
And nice stuff man !
How much does it cost? Which shop?
Wow, superbe photo, c'est mon nouvel arri√®re plan sur mon PC.
Is that in Outremont near the cemetery?
Do the stairs get crowded....just to love jogging on the mountain.
Ses a quel heure ?
ENWEILLE √Ä MAISON
Merci! C'etait le mien pour un bout
Nope, it's the stairs that lead to the chalet.
Yea they do, but there are walkways all around if you want to jog. Otherwise you might have to avoid peak hours and weekends.
The stairs are often crowed, however maybe not at sunrise when it‚Äôs -16... I love to run in Westmount for the switchbacks and hidden staircases all over the hill. The summit woods are a real gem and there are some phenomenal views of the oratory. Behind the old Royal Vic and the Redwood crescents are cool alternatives to the big staircases as well!
J'ai pris la photo le 6 Novembre √† 6:49AM.
Yeah, I was worried about the stairs as they are choke points.
I‚Äôve run up the mountain many times and it‚Äôs usually pretty easy to avoid the crowds. Too icy for me now however
Great image, love it. Was this taken at blue hour?

c‚Äôest ironique que le quebec adore l‚Äôid√©e de la la√Øcit√© quand il en vient a emp√™cher les femmes voil√©es d‚Äôetre professeure, tandis que cette √©norme croix demeure dans un endroit public, au sommet de l‚Äôile, visible a des kilom√®tres....
Ummm... 'Mont Royal' is the name of the small mountain / large hill that this landmark stands on. What you've presented to us here is called *'Croix du Mont-Royal'* or *'Mount Royal Cross'*.
When are they gonna take that shit down.
Watch this getting removed one day for being "offensive" to some. (But having cardi b sing about her WAP on TV is ok)
Nice shot OP.
Thanks!  You are correct, maybe 45mins-1 hour after sundown but still a bit of light out
Nice!!

i‚Äôm with you on this. it‚Äôs ironic that quebec is all about secularism when it comes to making sure no veiled woman can ever be a teacher, but when it comes to this giant cross on public land that everybody has to see every day, then they dont see the problem!
off the top of my head, i can think of 20 streets that start with saint, and nobody seems to have an issue with this.
they‚Äôre still naming new streets after christian saints to this day!
but can you even imagine the uproar if a new street was named ‚Äúmohammed‚Äù?
people dont realize their cognitive dissonance.
Your ilk are the ones calling to remove WAP not vice versa. Imagine fabricating scenarios like this randomly, lol. We're living rent free in your head. Such fucking victims.
Thanks!   Personally I prefer a WAP to a DAP (dry....) but that‚Äôs just me üòâ
Idgaf about how raunchy WAP is. Most offensive thing about this "song" is that it's a repetitive, unoriginal, cheap, trashy, generic reminder that sex sells. I cannot for the life of me comprehend why the world is so enamoured by Cardi B. At least, Meghan Thee Stallion has actual rapping chops. Shame she's wasting them on this kind of shite, but at least, there is some talent there.
Loooooooooooooook

I'm actually quite surprised by the number "thousands". I've even some articles saying Hundreds lol
I was there. I couldn't see the end of the people. It was easily in the tens of thousands. 
As a side question, do native quebecers feel more compassion for Palestinians due to the Queb-Can thing?

Pas un commentaire qui parle de masques. Stay classy, Montreal.

I compiled a video of the clashes after the manifestation, including police pepper-spraying a subdued man (and the crowd). Video shows the "clashes" after the manifestation at at Dorchester Square from the beginning to the end. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDv7XbAzOJ4

What did Israel do wrong ? Can someone educate me?
My understanding was two things set this off:
1 - a judgment evicting a few dozen Palestinians for squatting on land they didn‚Äôt own set of violent protests
2 - Israeli police set up crowd control checkpoints in the old city as a security precaution because Jerusalem Day often sparks violent confrontations
Hamas sends rockets into Tel Aviv indiscriminately targeting civilians and on we go
You know what is biased and unobjective? Claiming that israeli side is the only one to blame and the Palestinians are just innocent victims in all this. You people are way over simplifying the situation and falling into the classic "victim is always in the right" narrative which social justice warriors love to cling onto without further analysis. Both sides share responsibility for the conflict throughout the years.
Not sure how people can rationally believe that its ok for hamas to fire missiles at israel in response to 6 Palestinian families being evicted after a lengthy private property dispute which involved properties that jewish people legally purchased in the 19th century:
[https://www.wsj.com/articles/almost-nothing-youve-heard-about-evictions-in-jerusalem-is-true-11621019410](https://www.wsj.com/articles/almost-nothing-youve-heard-about-evictions-in-jerusalem-is-true-11621019410)
There are lots of shady things the israeli side has done over the years and i am not disputing that, but this can be equally said about the Palestinian side. If people would bother to read a wide variety of news sources rather than just seeing the same left wing echo-chamber sites you would open your eyes up to truth which is that this is a much more complicated issue in which no side can claim innocence.
Hamas is a terrorist organization period. They dont care who gets killed even if its their own side that suffers most due to their actions. People like to always bring up the fact that more Palestinians have been killed than israelis in order to somehow prove that israeli side is the evil aggressor. This fact completely ignores the fact that hamas operates entirely from civilian locations: they fires missiles from civilian locations - apartment rooftops, streets - and has bases and weapons located within hospitals, schools, and mosques. How do you expect israel to fight back against this type of tactic without killing civilians?
Israel has tried making concessions in the past in order to curry favor for peace deals. In 2005 they conceded land on the Gaza strip to Palestinians and Hamas responded by firing missiles at israel. Even worse, instead of allowing the Palestinian people to use the high tech greenhouses left behind by the israeli settlers that were evacuated they burned them all down and built rocket base instead. Hamas is a terror to its own people.
The point of my post is not to say that the Palestinians are in the wrong. I have alot of sympathy for their plight, but i think Israel is in a difficult situation where they get attacked by all sides. Both sides play aggressor and victims at times. Personally, i feel like it was a huge mistake creating an artificial state for jewish people in the first place. Jewish states were also being proposed for argentina, uganda, instead of palestine. I think no matter where the location of the jewish state would have been picked there would have been conflict.
&#x200B;
EDIT: Thanks for the rewards. Even though I know this has been downvoted, its been read by rational people.
Maybe you should protest hamas?

Look at all these maskless people, all the people they put in danger, is nobody thinking about the 8th wave??? We need to shut down the restaurants and put a 3pm curfew lmao
For the first time in my life I was afraid to wear my Star of David in public. People are sheep. Learn the facts about the world and you‚Äôll be free.
Um no, I have Israeli citizenship doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt sympathize with what Palestinians are going through
Edit: I do NOT support Hamas shooting rockets into Israel gonna make that clear. I am just anti death for any side
Si tu te promene un peu sur les sub politiques tu va avoir une mauvaise surprise
In the 60s-70s, yes. FLQ militants even went to train in Palestine. 
Now, it‚Äôs a bit of a mixed bag, for obvious reasons.
EDIT: [Petit documentaire RDI r√©cent sur les relations qu‚Äôentretenait le FLQ avec d‚Äôautres organisations r√©volutionnaires/terroristes de gauche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCkxNoyhRig) @25min pour la partie sp√©cifique √† la Palestine.
The separatists support independance movement and minorities fighting for freedom all around the world.
And any Qu√©becois can understand how it feel being a minority with your rights suppressed by the majority.
Of course, what is happening in Israel is on another level completely.
Yes , separatists have always been supportive to the Palestine cause.
My apartment overlooks the protest route, and definitely seemed like tens of thousands to me yesterday.
On a vraiment besoin d'une organisation impartiale avec une m√©thode scientifique qui compte les gens dans les manifestations... me semble qu'on reglerait ben de l'ostinage sur le compte final d'une foule.

As long as there something to protest, people will protest for it. It's pretty much as simple as that.
There's no "real side taken", it's just all about how the narrative is conveyed, for instance:
https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/pro-israel-rally-in-montreal-draws-3000-supporters
Note: If there's "no media coverage", usually there won't be any protest, eg. like what happened in Hong Kong, etc. Which is kind of sad.
5 year old hamas commander probably
I can try a bit better. basically it starts with abraham (the biblical one) where God promised him and his descendants a land that basically extends from the medeteranian sea spanning modern day israel and more (including part of Egypt, Jordan and part of Iran), but, God being God, said that Abraham's descendents would have to suffer for 400 years before getting the land. Fast forward to Joshua leading the Hebrews returning from slavery in Egypt (for which there is no archaeological evidence) came across the land of Canaan, and essentially the book of Joshua describes how the Hebrews committed genocide on the canaanites, because God did not want the hebrews to mix with the "idol worshippers" so they all had to be killed. 
&#x200B;
For some time there was a hebrew kingdom with all the 12 tribes, but after being conquered by the babylonian empire around 600BC and the greeks, persians and romans  the tribes were wiped out leaving only the tribe of Judah (where jews comes from) which was cast into the diaspora (meaning outside the promised land) after the land exchanged owners multiple times, though some jews did remain on the land, but very few. 
&#x200B;
Fast forward to more modern times, jews were being persecuted a lot in europe, evicted from spain during the inquisition, and a lot of violence was being perpetrated since many problems were blamed on Jews. Zionism sort of began then, which was a well-meaning idea to find a land where jews can live safely. Britain was committed to help and offered several solutions, but only ended up offereing Uganda and otehr african countries which the Jews were not interested, as they wanted Israel. Though many jews were also opposed to the idea and ultimately the movement sank for a while.
&#x200B;
Baron Rothchild a french jewish banker basically single-handedly revived the Zionist movement by purchasing a lot of Israel's land from the Ottoman Empire encouraged many people to come to the land and develop it and was quite sucessful. After world war one all the land was officially conquered by the french and the british who created the modern day borders and countries we know today in the middle east. The British wanted help from the jews and palestinians in the region and made treaties essentially promising the same land to both of them. However the british were committed to a two state solution but neither side were happy with the agreement and the jews resorted to terrorism to kick out the british and the british essentially gave up and withdrew.
&#x200B;
Winston Churchill  was a self-proclaimed zionist and at the end of world war two helped the jewish state to be founded to the dismay of surrounding arab nations. The jews were not satisfied with the borders either and David Ben Gurion the first prime minister of Israel said that they would accept the UN resolution and worry about the borders later. I beleive Israel prematurely declared independence and a massive war was triggered where Israel won and pushed out their border for security reasons (violating the geneva convention). In subsequent wars they continued to take more land and return some until you get modern Israel. At some point Israel had the whole sinai dessert, but gave it back to Egypt. 
&#x200B;
Essentially no one wanted a jewish state there. The US wanted it but for anti-semitic reasons: send jewish WWII refugees to Israel, we don't want them in the US, is basically what a US judge said. So, ironically,  anti-semitism played  a huge role in creating the state.
&#x200B;
The UN will only be happy once Israel has returned to the borders UN resolution of 1947 (i think) which was a pretty awkward partitionnning of the land for Israel that made it difficult to defend,. Jerusalem was also meant to be an internationally controlled city state. But since things have escalated some of the palestinian organizations refused to recognize the jewish state (even the UN sanctionned one (which is partly why the war broke out in 48). The PA now i beleive recognizes the Jewish state, but not as it currently is, but Hamas does not and calls for the eliminaiton of the state entirely which is tough to negotiate with. There was a good attempt at peace in the 90s, but the Israeli prime minister was assassinated by an Israeli extremist.
&#x200B;
But tldr: basically this mess is many people's fault including Britian who's responsibility it was (at the time) to draw the lines in the sand for Israel and Palestine, as they did for pretty much all the middle eastern countreis after the collapse of the ottoman empire, but they just dropped everything and left, leaving both groups of people the land was promised to to basically fight over it. The the UN got invovled and said, "these are the borders we want." No one was happy with them, then israel declared independence and drew the borders it wanted unilaterally after wining the ensuing war and the otehr wars thereafter. 
&#x200B;
I may have made some mistakes, but it should be a good starting point anyway.
definitely not from reddit, but from history books, wikipedia, couple of reputable youtube channels
Montreal is nearing 50 percent vaccination rate and the vast majority of the protestors wore masks, and outside contamination remains quite low, not to mention the fact this city has been engaging in rather large protests for the past year with no clear connection to rising cases (barring covidiot demos which spread contamination via bussing in people from all over the province, didn't respect any sanitary measures, etc).
There was literally less sanitary awareness at La Fontaine parc this evening than at Dorchester square, with a metric shit ton more people at the parc than at the demo. I know because I was at both (wearing masks and abiding sanitary measures).
Maybe start having a rational risk analysis framework.

Hi I‚Äôm just commenting on this post bc it‚Äôs recent. I‚Äôm looking for advice. :) my precious boyfriend is from Montreal and moved to the US almost a year ago. I want to get him some things from ‚Äúhome‚Äù as a gift. What kind of things should I be looking for? We‚Äôre in TX by the way, so I‚Äôm trying to start early since some things may take a long time to get here.

If it was me though, I'd love to get something like an Expo jersey. Pretty rare that people have those nowadays and it's nice nostalgic piece given his age.
Ideas that may or may not apply depending on taste:  
Montreal bagels (+smoked salmon and cream cheese?). Can be frozen for transport.    
A "postcard" showing the worst that winter has to offer ([example1](https://i.cbc.ca/1.5006626.1549391813!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_780/winter-water-slush-montreal.jpg) [example2](https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/weather-1.jpg?quality=85&strip=all)) so he does not miss the snow too much.   
Quebec microbrew beers, or ice cider.  
Maple syrup (bonus point if it comes with cr√™pes).

Also, you can just make a new post. The sub is not that inactive.
I did see it later on, but was blurry and of course, that means rain. I actually have a really good view of the full moon and love watching it right from my front window. However, it's overcast right now.
That‚Äôll do it!
perfect. he has mentioned the bagels before, i‚Äôll do that. yeah i didn‚Äôt want to do a whole new post in case he is on this sub lol

Je travaille √† temps partiel comme ATP dans une pharmacie.
√áa fait plus qu'un an que la pand√©mie a commenc√©, mais apparemment les proc√©dures sanitaires en pharmacie, c'est genre too much pour certains patients. 
L'autre jour, j'ai demand√© √† un patient de ne pas toucher aux √©l√©ments de partition et sa r√©action a √©t√© de toucher le plus de choses possibles (le comptoir, le cordon qui s√©pare la ligne du comptoir, etc.) en me demandant sur un ton de d√©fi s'il avait le droit au moins de toucher √† ces autres objets.

People are so self centered. It's always been about protecting the ones that we love, not ourselves. Idc if I get it and die, but I sure care if I'm responsible for the death of another.

elle et mon boss font ce qu'ils ont a faire, pendant ce temps j'fais ma fermeture de magasin... j'arrive pour faire le tour du comptoir, et j'attends qu'elle se deplace, pour garde une distance et LA... WOW elle me dit:
-Tu sais, jtravail en medical t'as pas a t'inquieter...
wow. j'demande a mon boss, "c'est qui elle?" et c'est la que j'apprends que c'est une hygieniste dentaire... wtf.
TL:DR  hygieniste dentaire sans masque, sans lavage de mains en lieu public.
Je vous comprend.
Je travaille avec des gens en Inde et c'est tellement terrible la bas.  On vient de perdre une jeune dame la bas.  Elle etait pas directement dans mon equippe mais je connais son chef d'√©quippe.   L'oncle d'un autre compatriote de travail est aussi deced√©.
Je connais personellwment 5 personnes  qui ont eu la covid.  Un d'eux n'a pas travaill√©  pendant une mois.
J'ai une autre compatriote de travail d'origine e africaine.  3 de ces amis proches ont perdu leurs p√®res.  Presque en meme temps.
Mes 2 meilleurs amies ont perdu leur grand mere au debut de la pandemie.
C'est insultant quand les gens s'en fouttent.
The fact that so many people do not take COVID seriously only reinforces why it is a good idea that I take extra precautions.
OP, vous etes absolument un humain qui merite le respect; ne doute jamais ca!
Je comprends bien. Je g√®re un magasin et covid m'a montr√© de quel niveau les gens s'en fou des autres. Le client n'a pas toujours raison,  Karen. Laisse mes employ√©s travailler en paix et en sant√©.
Allo
1-tu m√©rites le respect, fuck les clients comme cette madame la
2- c'est super l√©gitime de craindre la covid, pis de vouloir des mesures de protection pour soi. 
3- si ton boss te permet pas de remettre une cliente de m√™me √† sa place, j'esp√®re vraiment que d'autres clients d√©cideront d'intervenir.
3.5 - d'ailleurs, donc: Petit truc de madame qui aime pas les gens qui manquent de respect aux autres: r√©pondez leur avec douceur, gentillesse et compassion. "Madame, je pense que la dame √† la caisse m√©rite que vous respectiez sa bulle, ce serait gentil de votre part." 
Pis au pire, allez y d'un tr√®s souriant "mangez cordialement un char de marde". Habituellement, √ßa leur prend un moment de faire le pont entre votre douceur dans la forme de votre propos et l'apret√© du fond, profitez en pour continuer √† sourire et vous montrer beaucoup trop poli et adorable pour justifier leur col√®re.
Je travaille dans une √©picerie et je dois toujours rappeler au clients de mettre leurs masques, se d√©sinfecter les mains, etc. C‚Äôest tellement f√¢chant que j‚Äôai envie de les frapper. En tout cas, j‚Äôesp√®re que √ßa sera la derni√®re fois que quelque chose comme √ßa arrive pour toi.
C'est ce que je redoute le plus de la fin de pandemie (meme si on s'entend que la covid-19 ne va pas disparaitre). Tous les fucking morons qui vont se pointer la face "ah ben je le disais que c'etait pas vrai, j'ai bien fait de me mettre le masque dans le cul a place, gang de moutons qui se sont fait vacciner mou√© je le sais que c'etait toute de la marde" uuuuuuuuuugggggggggghhhhhhhhhhh
Honnetement, deja a la base j'avais des tendances mysanthropes, mais depuis la pandemie tout ce que je veux c'est decalisser sur Mars dans une societe de gens avec un QI positif (quoique, pas certain que je me qualifie, pour le coup) et laisser tous ces abrutis ici. Je dis abrutis, mais le pire c'est que souvent ce sont pas des caves, juste des trou de culs egoistes. C'est juste fou.
J'espere que ta famille recevra une vaccine bientot, quand mes parent ont recu leur dose c'etait comme si un poids enorme m'a ete enleve, maintenant j'attends a la duxieme dose de ma grand mere.   
Un calin socialement distancie pour toi, on est a la ligne d'arrivee!
L'impression que √ßa donne, c'est que les gens qui refusent de collaborer et de bien suivre les consignes mises en place sont des gens qui ne se sont jamais fait dire non, alors sont incapables de le prendre, ils sont √©gocentriques et √©go√Østes, et incapables de penser √† autre chose qu'√† leur nombril. C'est vraiment pas cute. 
√Ä ma job, les deux genres de clients qui collaborent le moins sont les hommes fin vingtaine, d√©but trentaine, et les hommes d'une soixantaine d'ann√©es. Les premiers sont du genre *malicious compliance* tandis que les autres sont du genre √† crier *tu m'diras pas quoi faire*. Genre fuck, √ßa tente √† personne. Je travaille √† l'ext√©rieur avec la chaleur qu'il y a ces temps-ci, et je survis et je ne me plains pas. C'est donc possible...
don't let that  affect the rest of your day/week/weekend... I just ignore idiots or calmly make them realize they are stupid
"ma'am whether you are afraid of covid or not, it doesn't matter to me or to any of my staff, There are regulations in place in this establishment and if you can't follow them regardless of your opinion on the matter then here might not be the place for you, please follow me I can direct you to the door... or you can follow regulations and I will serve you"
in a calm voice with the "i don't get paid enough to deal with or care about your level of stupidity" look in your face
Y'a du monde qui sont juste vraiment fucking stupide. Ca fait pas longtemps j'ai demander a une dame au IGA de mettre son masque sur son nez aussi, pi ca r√©ponse (complement indigne de s'avoir fait called out, c'est "oh je ne savais pas")   
Eille la vielle ca fait plus qu'un ans qu'on est la dedans calisse!  
Anyway moi aussi j'ai peur de la Covid, I'll scream it from the rooftops.
√áa vraiment expos√© les idiots de la soci√©t√©e cette Osti de Covid.
J'explique a tous le monde a quel point perdre mon gout ou mon odorat changerait ma vie, ca peut en affecter 2-3 mais ceux qui s' en crisse s'en crisse
> Dans ma t√™te, je voulais juste la crisser dehors cette personne-l√†.
Tu aurais du...
It is unfortunate that this person reacted aggressively to your concerns. There is no need of that, they sound like a shitty person. 
That being said, from a scientific perspective, the WHO and CDC have both been quite clear that after they had a chance to research it, fomite transmission (aka transmission on surfaces) is  rare. 
It is a bummer that Quebec‚Äôs regulations are stuck in April 2020 on this matter, but I just want to (maybe?) reduce your anxiety a bit on this one. Being worried about people touching things isn‚Äôt reflective of the current scientific consensus.
Les joies de vivre dans un syst√®me de plus en plus individualistes (sans compter qu'y a juste trop de cr√©tins).
Tu n'es pas la seule qui fait hyper attention. D'ailleurs, j'√©tais mysophobe ("germophobe") bien avant cette pand√©mie. :-)
Ton rant est bien justifi√©. J'ai partag√© ta col√®re et je ne suis pas certain que j'aurais fait preuve d'autant de patience que toi.
Keep fighting the good fight.
HA TA PEUR DU COVID
Well si sa me tente pas de prendre la chance de avoir a peu pr√®s 1 chance sur 1000 de crever (selon ma tranche d'age) et m√™me si j'en creve pas, sa peut etre un handicap a vie ou au moins le pire 2-3 semaines de ma vie.
Yeah I'll pass.
Beurk. D√©sol√© que quelqu'un t'as sorti une connerie comme √ßa.
Je te comprends tellement. Je trouve que c'est dur m√™me sur r/Montreal d'en parler, tu sais jamais si les gens vont t'appuyer ou te ridiculiser parce que "MeLe TOi dE TeS AFFaiRes" ou "AnYWaY oN ESt VaCCin√âS". Le pire c'est que t'a pas vraiment de recours, pis se plaindre ou ramener les gens √† l'ordre c'est toujours *ton* probl√®me. Anyway, si tu veux parler g√™ne toi pas :)

Someone came in to the restaurant the other day, and ask me if you needed to be vaccinated to eat. I told him his vaccination status is none of our business. The jackass said "Good, I'm not putting that crap in my body"
3 days back, and I regret going back already... why are these antivaxers so fkn loud.
People are stupid, doesn't matter the occasion. Move on.
You're so ridiculous and the day you just understand you're just like everyone else you're gonna be happy
Oof tout ce rant pour quelques mots.. tu aurais pu lui r√©pondre en disant oui t'as peur.. et lui dire que c'est important de respecter les mesures. Comme on fait en soci√©t√©.. on se parle. Maintenant tout le monde va chialer sur internet sur tout et rien. Ridicule
√áa fait plus d'un ans qu'on est enferm√© a cause de peureux comme toi. Trudeau ce promene sans masque a son parry de G7. En a seulement toute ces restrictions parce que les politiciens veulent ce faire r√©√©lire par ta gang d'hypochondriac.
Je travaille √† un IGA et une madame dans sa 50aine arrive sans masque. Je lui dit de le mettre et qu'elle ne peut rentrer sans masque. Elle essaie tout de m√™me de rentrer en disant du genre "inqui√®te toi p√¥, c'est tout de la bullshit an√©way". 
Donc bien sur je bloque won passage et lui r√©p√®te dans une voie fatigu√©e que je peut pas la laisser rentr√©e. 
Elle demande de voir mon superviseur, qui lui dit qu'elle n'a pas le droit de causer obstructions aux autres clients et qu'ont se r√©serve le droit de ne pas laisser qui ont veux rentrer. Elle part en m'appelant un idiot brainwasher par le gouvernement..
J'ai rit pis apr√®s me suis demander pourquoi elle est pas morte de COVID alors que du monde innocents on perdus leurs vie qui valait s√ªrement plus qu'une autre tabarnak qui vit sur la retraite.

Je pense que tu over react un peu. A 5000 cas / jour je dirais que tu as raison √† 100%,  mais avec moins de 200 cas par jour, ta r√©action est overkill. Oui faut porter le masque comme il faut... La cliente aurait d√ª le porter comme un faut, mais de la √† pondre un texte pour √ßa... Pas s√ªr

>De plus, OUI, J'AI FUCKING PEUR DE LA COVID, et je l'admets. Je vis au Qu√©bec seule depuis plusieurs ann√©es, et mes parents et d'autres membres de ma famille vivent dans un pays de l'Asie du Sud-Est et qui n'ont pas encore re√ßu leur premi√®re dose de vaccin. Surtout quand la plupart de ma famille travaillent dans le domaine de la sant√©, et ma m√®re qui est litt√©ralement la m√©decin de la famille... Je ne veux pas imaginer comment cela se passerait si ma m√®re ou mon p√®re l'attrape, et le virus infecte mes grandparents qui sont coll√©s au lit en perte d'autonomie.
I don't understand. If you're here and your parents are in southeast Asia, how would you transmit the virus to them?
Pu capable de parler de cet osti de sujet l√†
Tout le monde m√©rite de travailler dans un environnement respectueux. C'est aussi bien de ne pas √™tre en contact avec des personnes vuln√©rables.
Par contre, il y a quand m√™me 40 000 fans r√©unis dans un stade au Texas. Aucune √©closion et tuerie massive. √Ä moment donn√©, va falloir r√©aliser que on doit vivre AVEC la pr√©sence du virus et pas virer fou.

I do not miss working in the public one bit when I read this
C'est juste des abrutis qui cherchent un sens √† leur vie et qui ont besoin de se sentir sup√©rieur en meprisant les autres, ET en s'inventant des combats contre des ennemis qui n'existent pas ("coViD eSt uN HoAX... maIS nOuS sAchIonS")
Au contraire, les gens devraient appr√©cier ce que tu fais parce que sans toi leur vie serait plus compliqu√©e. En dehors du constat poche des jobs de service √† la client√®le dans le syst√®me capitaliste actuel, je dirais que tu subis le fait que tu es probablement la seule personne qui les reprend de faire quelque chose d'immature. Probablement aussi une des rares personnes √† qui ils parlent dans leur journ√©e...
J'esp√®re qu'au moins tu as deux-trois bons clients dans une journ√©e normale. Il faut essayer de *focuser* sur ceux-l√†, car malheureusement, des morons il y en a que trop quand tu fais du service √† la client√®le. Cela dit, on devrait forcer les gens √† faire 3 mois de service √† la client√®le dans leur vie, √ßa en remettrait peut-√™tre quelques uns √† leur place...
Respect pour avoir gard√© ton calme avec l'enfant de l'autre c√¥t√© du comptoir!
Solidarit√© avec toi! C'est juste incroyable, la r√©action enfantine de cette personne que tu as d√©crit :( √áa n'a pas √©t√© facile ces 2 derni√®res ann√©es en service √† la client√®le... √áa pourrit profond√©ment ma sant√© mentale.

It is about protecting the ones we love... but it is DEFINITELY about protecting ourselves too! Are you kidding me? How ridiculously fucked up is it that people feel awkward saying that? OF COURSE I want to protect myself, and anyone who mocks me for that can eat a bag of dicks. I don't need to make excuses for the type of POS people who make mockery of a deadly plague. Damn right I want to live!

SO much wow!
Very nice

Just over that yellow brick triangle going towards cote-vertu
What? I never noticed that, ground floor is a bit nasty lately, but i think it's a good looking station
Haha thank you. It took me 3 years to notice the satisfying geometry. Look upwards under the yellow brick triangle when going towards cote-vertu.

"2 weeks" ;)
Non-essential businesses flooding with hurried customers in 3... 2... 1...
Donc en gros ils savent que les gens vont se rassembler pour No√´l no matter what alors ils r√©duisent les lieux de rencontre possibles apr√®s les f√™tes pour faire une genre de quarantaine provinciale soft.
[deleted]
The only businesses that are non-essential seem to be mom-and-pop retail outlets and beauty salons... Everyone else either is (somehow) essential, is a supplier to an essential business (and therefore essential), or has a bunch of lawyers capable of coming up with a contrived scenario in which they would be essential (Well doctors are essential and they cant work if their fingernails get too long, so my manicure salon is essential too...)
Now if Legault wants to inspire himself from Germany, maybe he could be inspired by their well-funded and efficiently managed public healthcare system.
Also, given that we are in week 11 of the 4 week challenge, does anyone actually believe this will only be two weeks? Doesn't Legault realise that a big driver of non-compliance is a crisis of trust in his leadership? What happens if/when this goes beyond two weeks, why would anyone take anything else he says seriously.
We're 9 months into the "2-week shutdown to slow the spread".
" What is clear, however "
I love that they have to use that line. Good job government on clear, concise and thoughtful directions that don't change EVERY SINGLE DAY.
Clown show here in Quebec.
Aucune logique de fermer les business et restaurents mais de pas au moins rendre le secondaire √† distance et de separer les classes de primaires dans les primaires et secondaires avec l'espace gagn√©...
This is so fucking dumb. I am heart broken for small mom and pop shops at this point. Wtf is wrong with them. Costco, grocery stores are all totally fine with insane volumes of people yet the small shoe store on St Hubert with street access that has barely been able to make any sales this year is destroyed, think about the souvenir guys in the old port. You can agree to disagree with their business but they have been hammered by the pandemic. Post Christmas they have some hope of having someone walk around. Instead now they are going to have to wait until spring 2021 at best ! 
Seriously Legault, you're a giant illogical prick at this point......
[deleted]
if anyone believes the lockdown is going to last two weeks you're crazy.
C‚Äôest du gros n‚Äôimporte quoi, imaginer le nombre de cas apr√®s no√´l, on va laisser les gens se rendre malade pour faire rouler notre √©conomie et quand les sous seront rentr√©s on fermera tout pendant 2 semaines de toute fa√ßon les gens seront trop malade pour magasiner /s
Just do it now if its so important and youre concerned for our health
I guess they‚Äôre being realistic ‚Äî if they did it before Xmas everyone would flip their shit and disobey. This way, we get our shopping, our holiday time, and then a shutdown to minimize the spread of the inevitable massive bump in infections.
Except people who don't care are going to rush out to get gifts for parties they are going to have anyway.   
Stay out of stores.
What a shit show
Magasiner pour donner des cadeaux a ma famille que je peux pas voir LOLLLLL. #EffeOff

"instead of returning jan.4 students will return jan.11"   
holy shit, an entire week, wow, that's the end of the pandemic, that extra week is really going to make all the difference,
As long as I can hang out outside with people I'm cool tbh.
Expect Boxing Day sales starting next week!
Still won‚Äôt work. Tbh though the only thing really that I want is to be able to slap a puck around on some outdoor ice but apparently that is a fucking super spreader without data.
Croyez-vous que les √©tablissements de plein air seront aussi ferm√©s?
So I can go to the dentist on December 28th?!? I hope that is considered essential.
c'est bien.  
j'aurais mis 3 semaines, jusqu'au 18;
Riiiiight, because we're not in trouble NOW, and the virus will wait after a religious holiday to do anything worse...  ffs.
We didn‚Äôt shut down quick enough and we opened up too early in the Spring and we‚Äôve be paying for it ever since. 
Everyone can say whatever they want about China, but I would rather have been in my apt for 3 months and back to normal than this fkn shit.
For everyone who's gonna be partying during xmas anyway, and then everything will reopen and the numbers will stay bad. Most of the cases aren't even coming from shopping. Look I'm just pissed my pottery studio might have to close again and it's super safe and the only thing keeping me sane. Any little local Verdun shop I go to you wait in line, very little people inside, ect. You wanna contain the numbers for real, close everything in january, including school, and get better at testing. FFFF
can we get gyms back? please? how are we supposed to stay healthy in this weather and training indoors is difficult for some (especially during the holidays)
If only we had as many doctors and nurses as we have morons, everything would be great.
Too many self centred people out there.
Le gouvernement sait que les gens vont f√™ter en groupe. Faut pas jouer l‚Äôinnocent.
So... if we have had the same approach this whole time and we are still having a crisis "" in the hospitals...Not enough ICU beds...etc. Shouldn't we try another approach? 
How long until most of the businesses go bankrupt?
¬´ Apr√®s No√´l, Qu√©bec fermera les magasins non essentiels pour 2 semaines. ¬ª
Pauvre gars qui a travailler fort sur sa pub du boxing day
Fac le monde va s'infecter aux partys de no√´l pis fermenter leur virus chez eux en paix apr√®s.

This will be the final blow for alot of people.0 word of help for people with no money for rent,food etc
caskets for christmas, on sale at costco
Messemble que 90% des business on r√©ussi √† tomber sous l'aile de "essential business" la derni√®re fois.. √áa changera pas grand chose en gros
Wasn't everything already shut down?  I haven't been outside in ages so I dunno lol
will takeout restaurants still be operating?
Oh well, almost there. This thing won‚Äôt really end til next summer. At least it‚Äôs just a matter of time and getting vaccinated.
Still blows my mind that my workplace, a dessert/pastry shop, is still open and running as per usual. In no way are we considered essential.
I also don't understand how there are all these new restrictions put in place and yet the government of Quebec, Canada, and Montreal all collectively agreed to have a FESTIVAL happen right near my job ‚Äì the Old Port. 
Absolutely ridiculous. Please, Legault, make up your damn mind.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/beta.ctvnews.ca/local/montreal/2020/12/10/1_5225549.html just wanted to add the article discussing the transition in stores. The work that has gone on to protect employees and shoppers has been taken extremely seriously. I don‚Äôt know if in private offices the same steps have been taken.
March all over again :) I wonder why :)
Are construction workers getting an extra week ?
way to go
The fact that nobody will be able to buy anything non essential at big box stores is INSANE. this is supposed to be about health. By depriving consumers of this what is the point? A right isn‚Äôt made by making two wrongs...unbelievable...
This is so bad:(
Criss de jouflu.
Ridiculous. What is the agenda ,really?!

For any troubles in the subway, the person in the ticket boot has access to call security, don‚Äôt hesitate to go to him.  
Edit : Don‚Äôt hesitate to go to the STM website and leave a comment in the complaint and comments section. Most of those who harass you are already known and will be taken care of swiftly. But DO IT QUICKLY, all security footage are only kept 48 hours. Keep note of the station and the time of said event.
As a healthcare worker who takes the subway daily, things have gotten worse since Covid-19 started. With less people taking the public transport, these individuals are more visible and there's not necessarily a rise in mental health issues. But statistically drug consumption (whether it be legal or black market) is on the rise. Add into the mix layoffs, the cost of rent and the inflation, it'll get worse before it gets better.
I think it's a mix of mental health and drug use up significantly, generally - hell, among richer residents i believe alcohol consumption is way way up, you can imagine the shelters and the streets. 
Still it's not New York in the 1970s around here yet, or even Sainte-Catherine in the 1990s - some people are really exaggerating here. Maybe I'm weird but I can deal with some crazy while mental health/social services try to catch up. The violence is the real issue and for that i fully agree a few extended Popo visibility campaigns in specific downtown areas could really help if social services also does a lot of work on this.
Maybe file a complaint with the STM. They might or might not do something about it.
It is. 
The pandemic happened, it was harder to get drugs, no one to ask for spare change, hospitals and mental health ressources overwhelmed. Mix that with the fact that there was already a migration of homeless people to Montreal...
I've lived in Verdun for more than 12 years. I've seen the neighborhood go from poor/eclectic to full of hipsters to going full gentrified with families and now I see Lamborghini and Hummer in front of restaurants. The homeless crowd has never been bigger than what it is now, and I don't feel safe walking on Wellington when the sun is down. 
Last month, someone threw a wallet in my face at Lionel-Groulx. Like you, I've seen people trying to start a fight with randoms on the subway. I see more cases of people begging in the wagons or shouting or spitting everywhere. 
I hope ressources will be put at the right places to help those people AND assure the safety of public spaces.
I live in the village and things have absolutely deteriorated big time. I completely avoid walking on Saint Catherine‚Äôs if possible, it looks like some apocalyptic, dystopian, wasteland.
Definitely gotten worse.
I hear screaming outside nearly evening night now.
Huh, sorry to read that. I hope you're okay now.
Do you mind sharing what line and what stations it was at?
Je me fais downvot√© a chaque fois que je le mentionne mais ca reste vrai: la sant√© et la s√©curit√© des usagers  du m√©tro est depuis longtemps *officiellement* en bas de la liste de leur priorit√©s. Pour la STM les stations sont avant tout un "point de service pour personne en situation d'itin√©rance" et pour eux ca passe *avant* les pr√©ocupations des usagers du m√©tro.
qqun ici me traitait de paranoiaque la semaine derniere quand je disais que le m√©tro n'est plus s√©curitaire... il semble que je ne sois pas seul a trouver que c'est le cas!
Henry George 1890s: Progress and Poverty.
The more you push up land prices the more extreme poverty you get.
The latest increase of "help" to first time buyers from Project Montreal will increase prices further, pushing more and more people into extreme poverty.
Crazy. I don't ride the metro much anymore but when I did circa 2010-2014 I never worried about pickpockets... I always keep my stuff safe and with me though in general (on metro or anywhere) but maybe I was just lucky. Around the same time I visited Paris and was amazed at how many times the automated message would remind us "attention aux pickpockets!" on their metro (at least once every ride)... and I never heard that here at all.
station?  time?
i never encountered anything worse than a lunatic screaming I WANT A DAMN SMOKE...(at Bonaventure) i feel bad for all those incidents I read about.
do I scare them away or what?  they dont even bother asking me for chnage lol
It's crazy, maybe it's more visibility due to the lack of usage, but the metro feels much less safe. Downtown also, pan handlers are more aggressive and more present. I was walking downtown this weekend, and was asked for money over 15 times in the span of two hours... It's frankly disheartening. The juxtaposition of 5 Guys offering $18/hour and a person sitting right beside asking for money... Wild times.
If you think this is bad, you should see what Vancouver looks like right now. At the very least, check /r/Vancouver for some first hand accounts. Some Escape From NY type shit for real. No politician has convinced me that things will ever get better. Unless you run to the hills, expect police policy to push the problem to a jurisdiction near you.
I think pretty much everywhere is a little worse. 
During the day, less concerning but definitely more concerning at night. Bc you can tell that they are more affected by whatever substance -- or more in need of it. 
It's not a metro thing or even a downtown thing, although both of these now have more problems than they did before.
Le dimanche soir, c‚Äôest louche au centre. C‚Äôest comme √ßa depuis longtemps. Pas de cours, pas de magasins, pas de bureaux etc.
Omg word - my sister just got home and told me she was grabbed, followed,  and almost searched by a homeless woman at Beaubien
more cops do not make things safer though, they only react to crimes they dont prevent them....
my advice is always look pissed off when you're going outside downtown. that'll get people to leave you alone- i'm by no means imposing but i have a (so was i told) very masculine face and RBF. that has helped me a lot to make up for being otherwise quite thin
Covid really screwed up a lot of things and people. I'm sorry you had to go through that. 
My only bad experiences with homeless people were one guy kicking my leg and shoving his hand in my face while I was napping in the metro and another guy begging me to go to an atm to give him a 20 after I gave him 7. He left angrily after 3 stations because there's no way I'd go to a ATM with someone I don't know.
I avoid the orange line now because I feel like I'll snap someday...
I has having a little get together with friends last Saturday and a few meters from us some kids, maybe 5 where kicking a kid next to a tree, already down. We kinda chased them away but they stayed around pretending not to know whats up. Later about 10 showed up, some girls in the bunch too.
The kid was papper sprayed in the face and as we cleaned him up an other kid got some too. We gave both water and made sure they where alright. But it was weird. Anyways, they paper sprayed the first kid in the face again before leaving running away. Myself and a friend got a bit of it. We walked the guy to make sure he was safe but he meet up with friens that wanted to retaliate. Being older, I told them to just go home and stay safe but they dont know me.
So, now instead of guns or knifes kids will use paper spray to attack people. There's probably going to be some gang violence in parc lafontaine soon, so i'd avoid it as much as possible, especially at night. 
Not to be an asshole but most of them where of the darker complextion. Reming me of the kids from louis josef pappineau. It was probably a drug deal gone wrong but you never know when things will escalate with guns.
Things have gotten worse due to COVID, no doubt about that. Lots of people lost their jobs, rent is expensive, inflation, etc.
One thing I have noticed though, and not only regarding those that are homeless - overall people are just meaner...
People just seem so much more pissed off/aggressive. I go to work once a week, and there always seems to be a confrontation amongst people over the stupidest little thing.
People are on a short fuse these days.
We don‚Äôt need more police to punish these people. We need programs that help people before they get to that place. We don‚Äôt have nearly enough funding for social programs, and we already have huge over-funding for police.
Legit my life got much better after getting my car. No need to deal with all this shits and retards.
Here I am moving into Montreal, coin de cit√© du multim√©dia. C'est encourageant!
This why I have a small canister of bear spray with me
Man, not just downtown. All of Montreal's crime has been in a huge rise. Lots of gun activity also.
Can someone make a regularly updated thing posting what stops are to be avoided? (Instructions on how to post updates for us Luddites would be appreciated.)
Your not the only here, it feels like downtown is a different place.
Hey! I‚Äôm in Toronto and was thinking the same thing! The street harassment is ten fold worse than it has ever been. I was followed by a homeless guy this summer, and a friend was followed by an addict a few weeks ago. I‚Äôve had Asian friends physically assaulted here. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening. It definitely feels way less safe downtown than it did pre pandemic.
I live in the plateau and for the past 6 years its been super safe til covid hit. A mix of things has made living in this area an absolute nightmare sometime. I was almost mugged on st denis in broad daylight last year, i hid inside a dep im a regular at luckily so that time i feel lucky, but over all theres not really a vibe of safety like there used to be. I actually feel like night is safer though, ive had more bad things happen in daylight around other people than i ever have walking around at night mostly alone.
Val needs to go, she doesn't care.
Working in a social reinsertion center for drug users in montreal, I can say that the pandemic has caused so many relapses. I also noticed a huge increase in calls of people asking for refuge or therapy. Isolation, general stress and uncertainty about the future really drove people out of rehab, back to drug addiction. These people become homeless and desperate.
I find it‚Äôs always like this as the cold months approach.
Things are definitely worse with the pandemic effect. The pandemic has made scarce situation of some worse and more precarious.  People only have so much to deal with the problems.
The OP is right. The wallet scam: throw it at someone, that someone tries to catch it in order to protect the face/body, and now you are engaged with the scamster whether you like it or not. A ton of scams going on; watch out!
I feel the same. Saturday night my appartment building was victim of intense vandalism. During the night the fire alarm went off. We all went down to the lobby to see menacing words written all over the walls with literal.. shit. Shit everywhere. Shit on the handles, we couldn‚Äôt get out of the lobby. That stuff is scary. People called the cops but they didn‚Äôt care until various hours passed‚Ä¶ seems like it‚Äôs the norm.
Yes probably. Since less people are taking public transportation.
I mean I haven't done so since like March of 2020. Well except the bus once. But haven't step foot in a metro since then.
It's you. Live downtown for 4 years now after moving from the suburbs. Found downtown alot safer at night even than walking in the suburbs. I take public transportation everyday,  yes there are crack heads... know most of them by face by now, but to get pick pocketed or mugged? Never even almost happened. Idk
He should! He's in his own right if he feels threatened.
now all we need is more shootings....(‚ï¨‚âñ\_‚âñ)
the past week I think I've read about a shooting happening everyday in toronto
Was there last week for 3 days. It felt a lot safer than downtown London,ON but I was back in my hotel by 10pm so things might be worse later on
J'imagine que je suis pas la bonne personne a convaincre.  Je suis sur qu'il y a plein d'exemple ou tout fonctionne automatiquement. Il faudrait proposer a la STM de s'inspirer des succ√®s d'ailleur.
I think the problems were always there just it‚Äôs more noticeable now sadly. The pan handlers work in groups‚Ä¶ they have started fanning out to suburbs as well.
call 911
I'm currently watching the Radio Canada debate and they said there's 220 cops per 100 000 citizens in Montreal, way more than Calgary (166) or Toronto (180).
I walk by the village often and I can attest to this, but oh well you get used to it.
I come from suburbs of Paris, so I think that Montreal is really safe compared to Paris. But I'm totally agree that the situation is getting worse. I live near Lionel Groulx since 2019 and for like 6-12 months, there are a lot of weirdos at the metro exit (in the park). My girlfriend told me that a weird woman insulted her 1 week ago.
Hey, I'm sorry you went through this and I'm glad you notified the STM. I hope you will be safe from now on and not go through something like that again. 
I am always surprised however by the amount of people who are shocked that an affordable housing crisis, growing economic disparity, a worldwide health crisis, years of cuts in education and healthcare, 20,000 people on waiting list for mental health care, a huge hike in food prices, huge inflation would cause social unrest.
Read local news - renovictions, homeless folks encampments razed, everything is pricier, there are issues our city and province never properly dealt with for years and we are only now beginning to see the consequences, and that is because we are lucky to notice it only now. 
For many of lesser fortunate and vulnerable members of our society, crime and homelessness and general sketchiness was daily life.
There aren't a million ways to go about it. Crime and homelessness is linked with poverty and lack of a filet social. Mixed with burnt out healthcare system, we are lucky it's just this. 
Until many things change, I fear it will only get worse.
Take care,
Well‚Ä¶ inflation is up, depression is in, everybody is exhausted. the mayor is defunding the police and won‚Äôt buy bodycams even tho she said she would. Soo‚Ä¶.
S‚Äôcuse mais‚Ä¶

Belle photo!
Sais pas pourquoi mais j'ai un attachement injustifi√© au 1000 de la Gaucheti√®re.
C'est la forme qui, pour moi, repr√©sente notre centre-ville.
Edit: Le 1000 n'est pas l'√©difice en pointe que l'on voit dans cette photo. On en voit qu'un petit bout derri√®re le gros rectangle noir laitte. J'ai √©crit ce commentaire car, sans le 1000 dans la photo, c'est un peu moins Mtl pour moi. √áa reste une super belle photo tout de m√™me.
Ouin un peu trop disons qu'elle est inaccessible. (joke de traffic)
Tu est vraiment belle,en hivers en √©t√© et m√™me avec tes c√¥nes  orange je t‚Äôaime quand m√™me tu ear mon premier amour et m√™me si je t‚Äôest quitt√©e depuis longtemps je vais un jour revenir dans tes bras!!!!

Excellent angle. Ce qui serait g√©nial, ce serait le m√™me endroit mais avec un drone, plus √©lev√©, afin de voir la montagne et la croix.
Beautiful photo. Thanks for posting.

"ts√©" is short for "tu sais", the expression is used the same way as its translation "you know" when you speak familiarly with peole

Fak tu viens sur /r/montreal pour nous le dire dans un fil sur une photo de Montr√©al?
Est-ce que le mont Yamaska est aussi accessible au public que le mont Royal? Apr√®s le mont Yamaska, [qui semble majoritairement priv√©](https://www.lavoixdelest.ca/cahiers-speciaux/la-voix-de-saint-paul-dabbotsford-2021/lacces-public-au-mont-yamaska-toujours-dans-les-plans-cdfd2f7d541c1cfa687dc429a680044a), est-ce qu'il y a des for√™ts publiques o√π on peut aller faire une randonn√©e dans le coin de St-Paul?
Sans mentionner que l'acc√®s √† l'eau et √† un lac est plus facile √† Montr√©al. En plus il y a plusieurs kilom√®tres de parcs riverains le long du fleuve.
Peux-tu s√©rieusement me pointer les sentiers de marche publics dans le coin de Saint-Paul (excluant la Route des Champs)? Ou un endroit pour aller s'asseoir sur le bord de l'eau?
Je veux pas tourner √ßa en argument ville/campagne mais pour avoir fait les deux, les bois√©s, les cours d'eau et les lacs sont beaucoup plus accessibles √† Montr√©al (en en banlieue!) qu'ils ne le sont dans des petites villes de campagne du sud de la province, o√π tout est g√©n√©ralement priv√© et difficile d'acc√®s. Les parcs publics y sont souvent minuscules et si tu es pas propri√©taire riverain ou d'un bois√©, tu y a g√©n√©ralement pas acc√®s non plus.
Parc Jean-Drapeau, Parc du Mont-Royal, Parc La Fontaine, Parc Angrignon, Parc Maisonneuve, Parc nature du Bois-de-Liesse, Parc de l'Ile-de-la-Visitation, Parc des Rapides... pour ne nommer que ceux-ci. Pas assez d'espaces verts? C'est vrai qu'on en a jamais assez mais si j'√©tais locataire √† St-Paul, j'aurais jamais autant d'espaces verts √† pouvoir visiter.
Montr√©al est plus verte que sa banlieue.

Thank you! I appreciate it.
yes !!!!  euh    oui  monsieur !!
Despite it‚Äôs having some imperfections, I still love my city. Beautiful pic
Parc Dieppe is such a hidden gem
Wow, very cool shot!
What do you suppose that tower is going to be in the end, once they're done? 
I mean the new one at the end of the cruise ship quay.  The platforms that stick out are MASSIVE! It's a very strange looking thing right now.
Also, the crane they used to build this was HUGE, so freaking tall, and was clearly not needed for what they stopped at. Either plans changed, or there was only that tall-ass crane available. So many questions...
You guys have a beautiful city.  Are there any open air markets on those piers, or by the water?
[Is that legal?](https://i.imgur.com/HVpC8pK.gif)
https://nrc.canada.ca/en/drone-tool/
Anyone who when they will open up the park again ? I tried going there over the weekend and saw the entry was closed because of construction
Amazing picture! Thanks for sharing!
DAVE
Nice picture! Please consider sharing this on r/cityporn
How do I reach this parc? I put on Google and the maps takes me there and before I know it I‚Äôm on the flyover crossing my way to Jean Drapeau.  
Stumped!
Same. Love this island! Ever time I go for a walk in a different part of the island, I discover something new,; a different community, different vibe and an amazingly different culture. I love it!
Si tu veux avoir plus d'infos, la vue sera magnifique: 
https://forum.agoramtl.com/t/le-grand-quai-et-sa-tour-dobservation/715
It's an observation tower. It was planned to go up at the same time as the cruise ship terminal renovations, but it got delayed by a year. I forget why. Covid, I suppose.
The views onto the city and the river promise to be amazing. It should be finished before the year is out.
https://www.port-montreal.com/en/the-port-of-montreal/projects/grand-quay-observation-tower
Unfortunately, no. There used to be an awesome flea market in one of the sheds during the weekends, but that was decades ago. About the only commerce is a small food court, a snack bar, a handful of mobile food trucks and a row of kitschy souvenir / trinket shops.
The Old Port's pretty antiseptic and touristy nowadays. The only reasons I go are the girl-watching and the excellent views of the city and the river. It's a great place to watch the fireworks competition too.
Atwater market is close to the canal. It's not all open air but a good chunk of it is. It's usually gorgeous at this time of the year with all the spring flowers everywhere. It's like a festival of scents and colours. I love spring in Montreal (*proper* spring, i mean. Not the early part with months old garbage and dog shit everywhere.)
No, but people always mill about on the piers to amuse themselves.
If they're using something under 250g like a Mavic Mini then it's legal for now anyway.
As others mentioned, the rules are very different for drones under 250g. On that Transport Canada page, you can see that this you press the controller on the left and select "micro (<250g)". Under that category, nearly the whole island is open.
Of course, you still have to fly responsibly, and it's possible for certain areas to restrict you from taking off, landing, or operating a drone from within their territory. For example, Parc Jean-Drapeau bans drones that way. However, to my knowledge they cannot control the airspace so you can fly over as long as you take off, land, and operate from a different location.
Si le drone pese moins de 250g c'est legal
I was there on Friday. The parking is closed but you can still go to the park
Look on the satellite view, you should see an access road next to Habitat 67 at the begining of the bridge (in cit√© du havre). If going by car there is parking on that access road and under the bridge.
Wauw!!!
OK, il sera magnifique, oui. :)
They sure will be amazing!!!! I was wondering if it was going to be an urban bungee jumping spot or something. :D
Weird that you get downvoted, because honestly you're right.  
It IS weird how bland the pier is given the good energy coming from Montreal, and the distant connection to a French heritage and especially to a culture celebrating people of the land (in Paris there can be over a hundred different street markets, even to this day - although not all on the same day of the week). In fact there are small markets here and there on good seasons throughout the city, so it's not even like that couldn't exist.  
It's like a big commercial place with a thin line of bike lanes and railway, another round of touristy restaurants, and that's it. Atwater IS great, but there's no reason that sort of vibe couldn't be closer to downtown.  
(Well yes there's a reason, and it's called big money and becoming "antiseptic" like you described.. the fate of all cities attracting money I guess..)
Hopefully I get to take my family up there after things return to normal.  It sounds great.  I just looked up pics and it looks like it would be fun around Christmas time too.
Ahaan! Thank you so much.

I thought my upstairs neighbour fell out of bed
Welcome to Los Montreales, Canafornia.
Jokes aside, that woke me up good.
Yup. Same in hochalaga/maisonneuve area
I did! I thought a car ran into my apartment.
I'm in Laval and its the strongest earthquake I've experienced yet. My whole bed was shaking.
Je l'ai senti √† Ahuntsic en tout cas!
Yes, I'm pretty sure that's what it was. People on twitter felt it in Lanaudi√®re and Laval as well.
Edit: Confirmed 4.0 earthquake in Joliette!
Yes. Just one rumble. It shook the entire building. I am on the 8th floor and it woke me up. For me it wasn't a whole 15 seconds, just a quick shake.
Yep, we felt it in Verdun
it happened 2 times. There was another at 6:30am-7AM. I heard Jets this morning I thought It was a Sonic Boom. Wasnt the first one around 5AM ?
Edit.: I heard a really loud BOOM while my whole place was rattling.
Yes! NDG, felt like a huge object fell and shook the whole house.
>Overall I think the events like this have increased in the last 5 years.
Kinda.
According to [earthquaketrack.com](https://earthquaketrack.com/ca-10-montreal/recent?mag_filter=3) filtering by atleast a 3.0 magnitude shows there have been:
* 4 in the last year
* none between 1 and 5 years ago
* 14 between 5 and 10 years go
So certainly a lot this year after 4 years of nothing. But then compared to 5 to 10 years ago, its pretty par for the course.
Yes! In the Plateau it woke me up and I came here to see if anyone else felt it.
Felt it in Villeray
Pointe-aux-Trembles, c‚Äô√©tait intense 2-3 secondes
St Henri checking in!
Windows rattled a bit in little Italy
Vaccines are kicking in...
Yep, for sure.
Dunno if this is the same thing, but I assume: https://www.earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca/index-en.php?tpl_region=eon_wqc
Most recently entry is 4.0 up in Joliette.
Je l'ai senti dans le vieux Longueuil aussi
Je l'ai senti aussi √† Ville-√âmard. √âtrange.
Yep, I felt that.
Oui Rosemont aussi.
Yup in the West Island.  It woke me up.
Ouais, je suis dans Ahuntsic et je l‚Äôai aussi ressenti pendant un bon 10 secondes vers 7:01!
Park Ex, can confirm.
Yeah it woke me up, my budgies were so scared too
All the way out in the suburbs (Duverney, Laval), felt it too
Wow ! Came on here to confirm if that was it. Wow ! It felt like a car ran into my triplex, I'm on top floor
Felt it in Montreal-Nord
Yeah, I did too. It was weird. 
There was a low rumble which got noticeably lower, and then heard the windows move like a pressure wave hit them. Then it calmed down fairly quickly.
Je l'ai senti a villeray sur mon bol de toilette :o
Did I sleep through that? I didnt feel anything
Yes!
Yeah, also in Milton Park, but it was very short.
Felt it in Laval a few mins ago. It woke me up so I wasn't sure, but this confirms my doubts
heard it before I felt it.
Seismic activity has been increasing. It's a little concerning considering the fault line we're on
Just felt it in the yard in Anjou too, Twitter is blowing up about it
Longueuil aussi je l'ai senti
Felt it in Longueuil too!
Brossard I heard a loud boom this morning... Thought I was crazy
Je suis √† Saint-Eustache et je l‚Äôai senti!
I felt the earthquake all the way in Laval. My entire bed shook. It lasted a few seconds. But weirdly the light fixtures didn't shake.
Yep Montr√©al east too
Oui. Same in Mont-Royal
je confirme l'avoir entendu au Nord de St-J√©r√¥me, presque √† St-Sauveur!
Yep - downtown near Concordia.
C‚Äôest un √©pervier brun.
Y'a l'air b√™te ton faucon
Parles-mo√©, parles-mo√©!
No way, that's definitely a racoon.
Claude Fauchon?
Oui il me semble qu'il y a un nid sur la grosse √©glise coin St-Antoine/Vinet(?)

Nooope, Chuck Testa !

C‚Äôest un gros faucon p√®lerin il est venu chez moi pour attraper les petit oiseaux je me suis dress√© devant lui il c‚Äôest sauver il est mieux pas toucher mes oiseaux adorables yeahhhhhhhhhhh
Oui tu as raison!! Merci beaucoup
TIL I learned the French word for Cooper‚Äôs hawk
Je pense aussi. C'est clairement pas un faucon.
Faut pas juger trop vite parce que en fait y‚Äôa un doctorat en √©tudes a√©riennes. J‚Äôai pas √©t√© ass√© vite pour le prendre en photo mais quand je l‚Äôai vue au d√©but il portait son tophat et son monocle

I noticed that your other photos were taken by the Fuji XT-3. Any chance this one was as well? I really dig the colors. Any simulation used?
Do you mind if I use this as a wallpaper? This is amazing

T'es bold d'assumer son identit√© dem√™me.
Tas un probleme avec les arbre ?
M√¢rci !
Y'a des vautours juch√©s sur les pierres!
Merci !
Hello !
Yup it was shot on the Fuji X-T3, no simulation and at the morning golden hour; this really helped for the colours. On CaptureOne the edits looks like this: contrast (+27), brightness (+20), saturation (+28) and I cranked up the clarity to +40 wich had the effect of densifying the fog in the middle.
I really really love the Fuji system, I've been with Nikon for 10 years and god knows I loved my D7000, but I never enjoyed it like I enjoy shooting with the fuji, I'm basicaly bringing it everywhere anytime. Anyway, thanks mate and have a good day !
Not at all, in fact I'm very flattered. It was well worth getting up at 5 am to shot this after all :D
Un gang de zombies pompettes cours apr√®s moi 'vec une machette!
They need to convert it into a Roman bathhouse in order to host the post-covid orgy.
The structure couldn‚Äôt handle a wave pool or lake in the main stadium. Part of the garage below have already began crumbling due to stress. I think they stabilized it enough to keep the stadium usable but there no way it could handle the additional load
I'm not against the idea but this is Montreal/QC planning will take 10 years, budget will be overblown 10 times then they'll have to restart because someone forgot to order bilingual lumber or some sh*t like that.
When I lived beside it I thought they should turn the thing into a massive middle eastern style bazaar.  I'm really liking your idea though.
Turn it into a coliseum and bring the gladiators back. Have those who broke covid rules fight each other. Bring the whole family!
Une station de ski int√©rieur serait vraiment Nice sinon!
Pourrait vendre des poutines congel√©s aussi!
On se sert souvent du stade olympique comme un centre de gestion de crise, on s'en est servi pour abriter les r√©fugi√©s ha√Øtiens, on s'en set pr√©sentement pour donner des vaccins contre la covid. Je pense pas qu'on pourrait s'en servir de la m√™me fa√ßon si on le convertis en plage.
Lol you should bring your ideas to the [participatory budgeting group] (https://www.makingmtl.ca/). This one may be too ambitious but I like where your head's at
If we're going to keep this thing up with our tax money, we might as well open it to sub-division and rental possibilities for various venues. Flea markets, expos, etc. 
I don't think the structure is sound enough for such an overhaul, but your idea is a great springboard for more. 
We need a plan that brings us closer to reaping the benefits of all the money we sank into that white elephant.
Quelqu'un est jaloux du Bora Bora :)
It‚Äôs being put to good use now as  a mass vaccine Center . A huge stadium is an asset to our city. It‚Äôs the people running it who need to be forward thinking and creative
Not a bad idea at all!!
This is the best idea I have yet to hear, it could also be very tropical and have hanging gardens making it very unique, put climbing walls on the tower as well and water slides. This is what we need!
Can we vote op as the mayor?
The alouettes are going back to the Big O as their game stadium, if i recall correctly
It was a colossal failure of project management and the Mayor Jean Drapeau in cost and planning. In the end it is still a well made structure, but the number of construction fails give it a bad reputation. I lived beside it, and 1 yr noted only 8 days it was used. As a creative mind, I have too many ideas, and thought of what I would do with it to make it full every day. The thing that Montrealers, New Yorkers, Ottawa and Toronto want the most is bikini time. So.....make it attract bikinis nightly. Not just in summer. That means indoor beach in a large frozen city attached to public transport. Families are actually the largest disposable incomes, so it needs all ages enjoyment. Liquor is the most lucrative sale, so bars and clubs. Drunk ass idiots are the worst, so keep them indoors under surveillance instead of Edmontons version of letting them on streets. Screams indoor beach experience.
Kind of like Tropical Islands in Germany?
Maybe that's a good solution to bring in regular revenue
Quebec city has their indoor amusement park and now indoor water park
And maybe, maybe it could help some people needs for going away on vacation every winter, sometimes just a few hours of warm air and UV would trick some brains into relaxing enough
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Islands_Resort
That's actually an awesome idea. There's a theme park outside of Berlin called [Tropical Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Islands_Resort), and it was built in a former Nazi airship hangar. It is the largest indoor water park on Earth. It's really nice to be able to go there on a damp, dreary January day, breathing warm air and being able to swim and lounge.
I always thought this stadium should be converted into an X-Games type of venue. Build a ramp so people could mountain bike up and down from the higher seats to the field - that has to be almost 8 stories high (?!).  Extreme and regular wall climbing. A BMX ramp somewhere. Bungee jump from the roof "ring". Bref, your idea and mine together and don't forget to ask Redbull to sponsor the whole thing for a couple of millions/year!
I am assuming this post is meant as a joke? It is true it is sad to see this beautiful stadium so unused.  Last time I was inside was 1983 Talking Heads and the Police concert. It is a good venue for big shows, but it is of course fundamentally a sports venue, and should be used as such.  The problem seems to be that it is just too big for the kinds of crowds anticipated.  IMHO the city shouldn't be considering building a new baseball stadium when this would work fine, is already there and hardly used, even if the crowds were only at half capacity.
Interesting idea and made me laugh while reading it :) take your upvote.
edit: why are you drunk at 9 am?

I like it! How about making it full aquatic so I can scubadive all year round?!
Just turn it into it!
Or....they could buldoze it and create an incredible greenspace open to the public.
I like the idea of an extreme sports complex. Turn the tower into a climbing wall and watch the economy around the olympic park grow. Problem is boomers hate extreme sports and the smell of pot. The olympics aren‚Äôt very interesting anymore so why not promote some fun cool sports
Yes!!! Just like "Tropical Islands" resort in Germany
I just wish Canada would adopt a caribbean island so I could go to a real beach and pay using CAD. And Canadian Tire money.
Or just repeal all the shitty interventionist legislation that holds our economy back (like converting street parking into cyclist areas) and raise money to actually bid & host the Olympics so we can bring back businesses and reap the tax rewards.
But of course, this will never happen, for countless reasons left unstated.
If the romans could fill in a coliseum with water and organise naval battles (triremes) for a show, can't we have just 5 feet deep of water?
Yes, yes and yes
That would be a terrific idea üí° To bad our politicians are looking out for themselves instead of doing their job and work for the people who pay there salary
Or how about one of those Mideivel Times restaurants
When I was a kid I went roller skating there once. Pretty good. Would go do again.
Or just bring the Expos back.
Masks are mandatory or not?
Be sure to close it at 6pm every day "to help the families of the employees"
It‚Äôll suck when the indoor beach is eventually moved to Washington.
Reopen Bain Maquire!
How about the ten ton blocks of falling concrete?
Expo 2067 wya
Or turn it into a shelter and house the homeless?
Svp pas de beach club dans hochelaga. Merci.
make it an outdoor beach and use the demolished building to make the sand
If they were able to hold gladiator fights with boats in the Coloseum, we can do that at the Big O.

Oh mon dieu tellement!
Yup, all pink except the sky and the building and signs you can see a bit of on the right.
There is nothing special about this road, you don't wanna go there üòÖ. It looks like this because it was shot in infrared.
Ok, thanks. Interesting that infrared does that.
It's all about the editing though, image comes out all orange in raw file, after white balance adjustment the sky is orange-yellow and the leaves are all blue. I finish by swapping the red channel and the blue channel in Photoshop (or setting blue as red, red as green and green as blue or something similar). A similar effect can be done on normal images, but it won't look 100% the same as IR also affects tones, contrast, haze (from Rayleigh scattering), etc
Oh I see. That makes sense.
Reading this made me sick.
There needs to be a public investigation on how the SPVM handled this.
A lot of it makes no sense whatsoever.
The fact that every step of the way she was ignored, and both the police and hospital staff did nothing for her, and even blamed her, is absolutely disgusting. 
Human trafficking is such a terrifying problem that isn't talked enough about.
I can‚Äòt believe how worthless our judicial system is for sex crimes. It‚Äôs disgraceful for a seemingly progressive country.
What I want to know is what bar was this? The bartender probably laced her drink, the bouncer *high-fived her kidnapper* on their way out. It really sounds like this bar is part of the network. They should release the name.
So the cops knew the guy, and knew the location, which means they knew that this activity was most likely going on, yet they still refused to do anything when the friends asked for help at multiple police stations. What kind of bullshit is that. And telling the friends they have to wait 72 hours before taking action? What about the whole "first 48 hours" thing. This whole thing smells fishy. I don't trust cops for one second, and I wouldn't be surprised to find out they were not only complicit but involved in aiding these traffickers.

ACAB. The pigs who said "come back in 72 hours" should be fired and named&shamed.
>She said the police told her friends that there was nothing they could do, they had to wait 72 hours until she was officially a missing person.
I thought that was a myth.
Positively scandalized by what I read. I sent a link to the article to the Radio-Canada newsroom. You can too by writing to temoin@radio-canada.ca or assignmentmontreal@cbc.ca
This story is horrible and the justice system has clearly failed her.
Honest question, is this actually considered human trafficking?

This is like Fugueuse in real life
Clancy is an amazing, strong lady. I hope her bravery isn't wasted.
This is vile beyond belief.. The cops knew the address and didnt survey it regularly. How many ladies has this happened to?
C‚Äôest horrible.
True story: a while ago it was my and a girl's birthday. We were partying a bit at the club. Some guys offered her some shots and she shared them with me. Now, I've been drunk before. I've had my share of "way too much... Never drinking again". But that night it was insane. I can't remember everything but still remember alot more than pass out drunk. I was GONE. I mean I was dancing like a fucking fool, lost all inhibition, still able to stand and conversate well enough but it was as if I was super drunk but physically able to handle my self. Buddy of mine dropped me home. Apparently I dropped in bed breaking the bed. Next day i slept almost all day. There is no doubt that the shots were spiked as it was the last thing I drank and it was midnight. I'm happy that the girl I was with was ok as we were a fairly big group.  She slept passed out for really 24 hours. Anyone victim blaming should be given this drug in a control environment and they will absolutely change their mind.
spvm are fucking useless and never fail to meet said expectations
A few people from my highschool in NS, while we were in highschool, went to jail for a long time for human trafficking. It's crazy and starts younger than most people may think.
This is fucking disgusting!! How could police or medical staff not try their hardest to help this poor girl! My god how awful. üò¢
This is sad, but in the same time it's reality and very common, lot of shit people out there, thats why when you go to bar you need to be extra careful, specially for girls.
I read a while ago in 1 of the fb group, on the comment there was this guy that always brought drug when going for date and put it on the girl drink to make her horny, no one saying anything except me and the other guy basically treat me saying I need to calm down, wtf going on with people these days.
C'est d√©gueulasse.
SPVM #winning
Montreal needs ‚ÄúThe Equalizer‚Äù to take care of this shit
Can someone explain exactly where the"human trafficking" is in this story ?
From what I understand, a girl in a bar gets stuffed and threatened, walks out with her kidnapper, in a cab to another apartment in Montreal, allegedly gets raped 3 times and takes drugs again and then is rescued by a swat team by posting her address on Instagram.
This is kidnapping, not human trafficking. And they sent in the swat team but then didn't believe the victim ? They sent in the swat team but didn't search the apartment for openly visible illegal weapons?
And this is a story from 5 years ago ?
I'll tell you what this story sounds like, a foreign fabrication to signal boost a liar and promote baseless social strife.
[deleted]
My ex gf was drugged at a daytime ball hockey tournament. Luckily I was able to get to her with the police and get her to the hospital.
The doctors AND nurse treated her like she was just some drunk retard, it was 10:30 pm.
This is even after I told them I think she's been drugged. 
They didn't test her for date rape drugs or anything.
The next day (last thing she remembered was a guy bringing her a drink) the cops told me this happens every night, and if she didn't want to press charges there was nothing to be done.
Keep in mind, the wolds biggest date rape drug dealer came from Quebec and was arrested by the RCMP a couple of years ago.
Not this case. Every fucking time. They DO NOT care. This case is only in the news because she got out, and because she was a university student. Even then they didn't care.
They could do so much. But they are either too lazy or just payed off.
Now imagine when you're a runaway foster kid. They could have done so much, or at least something. They never do. I just want to scream at them.
This sort of thing is why I would generally not bother reporting a sex crime to the police. If I still know where the guy is, I'm handling it in a different way... that may or may not be legal.
>There needs to be a public investigation on how the SPVM handled this.
100% on this! There must be lots of noise for this to happen! It's depressing to see victims suffer like this. The system completely failed her. This is absolutely disgusting.  
 üò¢
Yeah, they will be investigated by another police service who will find that everything was peachy keen and above board.
This was also 7 years ago. Maybe it‚Äôs gotten better under new admin?
I was raped and went to SPVM. They took me seriously at the start but never even spoke to the man who did it despite me having his name, address, and his confession over text that he had surreptitiously recorded the encounter. They called him, asked if he wanted to come in, he said no, so they told me there was nothing else they could do. Fuck me, right? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I've been laced two times at the same bar. I wonder now...
!!!! Pls? Where was that
I'm guessing they don't specifically so that people like you don't assume that. I'm all for pitchforks but a high five on the way out could be for a number of reasons, or no reason at all.
They acted once they had the address, read it again.
Quand une personne dispara√Æt, la police devrait visiter toutes les addresses connus des policiers? √áa va en faire des visites... Pis de toute fa√ßon, m√™me s‚Äôils connaissent l‚Äôadresse pour une raison X, √ßa reste que la police n‚Äôa pas le pouvoir de s‚Äôintroduire sans preuve qu‚Äôun crime est en cours.

Why? It's probably a procedure he/she was told to follow.
It's the people who set these procedures that need training or discipline if they are not following their training.
It is: [https://missingpersonsinformation.ca/resources/quick-facts-about-reporting-a-missing-adult-in-canada/](https://missingpersonsinformation.ca/resources/quick-facts-about-reporting-a-missing-adult-in-canada/)
Not surprising they'd do this, especially when the person is an adult and alcohol is involved. Had the same thing happen in my group of friends, we went out, 3AM, waiting for one of our friends to meet us, she never showed, we couldn't reach her, out of character, etc... we call the cops, go to the station as well, told that it's 48 hours for a missing person and that she's probably just sleeping with some dude... 
It's sobering to think that this happens, and society turns a blind eye.
I just emailed them both. I am completely appalled by how this was handled. It makes absolutely no sense. I'm convinced the bartender / bar are part of the network... This story needs to get out on every news outlet to show how absolutely useless the police and the hospital were in that situation...
Well...it‚Äôs not. It has elements. And it was headed into that direction pretty quick. But it was kidnapping, forcible confinement, abuse, rape, etc. But no, it was not human trafficking. Do I think that was next? Yes.

Exactement!
It took me a while to realize that jfl gagged stands for a just for laughs gag. At first I thought it was some sort of wierd bdsm scene in Montreal which everyone on this thread seemed to know about.
Wait until it airs and they put a circus soundtrack on your humiliation
15 years ago I got JFL gagged at parc Lafontaine.  Asked to look after a dog for a second to have another  guy come and play with said dog.  Dog runs away leaving me standing there like an idiot.  But both guys had little pieces of tape/bandaids on their ears which I found very suspicious.  keep in mind I‚Äôve been jacked many times.  I had also smoked a joint and was walking with a brand new dell laptop in my bag.  I was tripping and sure I was getting robbed.  Had this gag lasted 2 more minutes I was throwing punches.  I was sure it was a robbery.  It wasn‚Äôt.  I signed the waver out of relief
the show is STILL going on??? wtf
I've always wondered -- does refusing to sign the waiver mean they won't include you in the show? I've lived here my entire life and I've always hated jfl gags. I've passed by a few obvious ones as a teen and always give them a wiiiiiiiide berth
lol they stopped me in the park to gag my friend and have me participate as being in on the joke.
LOL don't sign!
ETA -- also, which park?
My friend's dad was part of one probably 10 or 15 years ago.
It was at a golf shop and they would get you to practice your swing in the simulator but then lower a chandelier within striking distance while you practiced. Then the store owner would try to haggle you about paying hundreds of dollars for the broken chandelier.
He was a lawyer and although he was kind of a funny guy he just didn't feel like everyone seeing him get pranked on TV for the rest of eternity so he just said no to the waiver. They offered him money. Think they offered 150 then 300$ because his reaction was apparently pretty good so they really wanted it in the show. Still said no and they never were able to use it.
I don't know about the rest of you, but I find Just for Laughs Gags to be hilarious. Sometimes when I'm down I'll binge watch a series of clips on YouTube and it always brightens my day. 
My favourite clip that I saw recently was the classic "[fat man breaks car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V86DTP1OrqI)"
As for your PTSD... well just keep in mind, no one is really "laughing at you", they are just laughing at the ridiculousness of the situation. It's all in good fun!
yeah it happened to me last year, everything goes by so fast. Once they show the cameras and the gag ends, the actors disappear into thin air and you're left with a production assistant who rushes you to sign the waiver and get on your way so they can reset. I don't even know if/when it aired, i don't even know if my face is on tv for all to see .
They should really work on how they deal with you after it's done, it wouldn't be super hard to take a little more time to explain the details to you before making you sign and letting you go. By the time i realised i'd signed a waiver without even reading it i was long gone.
They still do this!?!?!? 
God I have to move back to Montreal lol
Maybe it's just paranoia but I just...wouldn't sign the waiver.
I mean you get absolutely nothing while being asked to sign a legally binding document that you almost certainly didn't read through. I see no gain in this. Even if you really want to be on TV they probably don't tell you if/when you'll appear or what it'll look like.
Got gagged by jfl too a few years ago. Sadly, their gag was super lame and the people working on it looked really annoyed with me for not having the reaction they wanted. Their gag was literally a dude hiding in a bush dangling a fake arm from a fishing rod, but he was in my line of sight the entire time so yeah... didn‚Äôt exactly have the element of surprise. They actually asked me to redo it ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
j'ai fuckall id√©e de quoi tu parles.
I like JFL Gags but you can tell which ones work well and which ones don't. Some of them are quite funny though. I'm personally a fan of the [ball avalanche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPfWSygDz5E) or when someone got caught seeming to[ lead a protest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2F0scbeT0c) .
I‚Äôve always hated that show. I can‚Äôt watch it. Some of the gags are just plain cruel. Kind of pisses me off that it‚Äôs still running.
Do I want to google that?
Lol, my brother got gagged, and realized it halfway through the bit (he's a big fan, and he recognized one of the actors...)
He had a different life-changing experience - they asked him if he wanted to pretend to be surprised and air his bit. He was *devastated*!!! He loves the show, and was So bummed that it was 'fake'. Turns out, most of the reactions are real, but if it's been a long day, and not many successes, they might re-tape to finish the end.
He chose to stick around and help gag other people for a while.
He's a 45 year old doctor.
I have never in my life understood this show. I'd be very curious as to how they got you. It always seems like they have some little Anglo kid sitting in the middle of like Parc La Fontaine with a 1960s-style lemonade stand or something that just comes across as beyond ridiculous.
Where do they even show this program? The only time I've ever seen it is - seriously - on flights in Argentina. I used to fly LAN Argentina from BA to Patagonia sometimes for work, and this would be much of their in-flight "entertainment." But that was a few years ago even.
The only thing I have always found super strange about that show is how they can have the cops screw with people. That doesn‚Äôt seem like a good idea for about 100 different reasons.
I got pranked, the actor I accidentally "harmed" was keeping up the act for a little too long and I felt wretched.  When someone shoved a clipboard in my face and said something in mumble-French I signed it without looking, then they told me to get the hell out.  Later I realized what happened, and I could lose my job if the wrong person saw it on teevee.
It was a horrible, horrible experience; if I had to do it over again, I would've called the cops to report what happened before someone could explain it was a hoax.
Do you get paid?
Congrats on being one of the lucky real gagged!
My friend was once hired as an actress to be pranked. they do it for about 60-70% of their gags. Hers involved a real elephant so they probably couldn't take any chance of messing it up and probably had to film it quick for legal animal abuse reasons so they hired actor to keep it easy peasy.
If it can reassure you, there is a lot of chance that they just don't keep your part for tbe show They gag a lot of people and just keep a few for the TV. My girlfriend was gag many years ago and never got to see it on TV. With my google skills I found the segment quickly and then we saw that she was not part of it. Her reaction was not big enough.
You might have just encountered an SCP anomaly. http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-2030
My first summer (2001?) in Montreal I was shocked by a filming of Naked News on St. Catherine. A JFL gag would be small stuff after that? I'm from the states originally... hehe
Omg I'm so jealous!!!
> You sign a waiver at the end and they leave you all alone to pick up the pieces of your life.
what?
I mean how bad was it?  can you tell or the waiver has an NDA ?
What are you talking about?
So are you going to explain what the gag was?
are you laughing with you or laughing at you
You'll live. These are hilarious. Congrats and enjoy it.
(Also, noone calls it "JFL Gagged", hence why everyone is confused. Spell it out properly next time).
I feel like I see them every few weeks in the summer at Lionel-Groulx and they look obvious as shit with the big columns of draped scaffolding to hide their cameras. Were they more subtle this time?
I got pranked today as well! The blind guy with bird poop on his phone. I thought it was funny afterward, but in the moment I was a bit shaken up.
Just dont sign dummy
do youuu wanna talk about it lol
Wait the time I got jfl they picked me in advance. I was sure after that it was all staged. You telling me it isn't?
Do you have to sign the waiver? Do you get any benefit from doing so?
I saw them once near the Balcon on sainte Catherine and it was blatantly obvious that it was a skit.
Does it pay anything?
Do they offer you anything in return? Passes to a jfl show or something?
I'm actually surprised these are really candid scenes. I thought they were all staged.
Sa existe encore ?
Are you allowed to share details of the gag? Or would that go against the waiver?
Can you not sign the waiver and not have it broadcasted ?   
I worked on set for Juste pour Rire once, only once, and never will again.
Watch the impractical jokers, they laugh at themself instead of other people
Being JFL gagged is a right of passage for Montrealers! Today, you became a (wo)man.
Smile, you are on candid camera.
Moi √ßa serait NOPE! Je ne signerai jamais de contrat avec Devil Rozon.
What was the gag?
Wow beautiful.  Thanks for posting.
Greetings from NYC. Missing Montreal dearly.
Such an underrated part of the city. Also great they closed off that section of the wharf from cars
Where on the Lachine Canal?
LIved in Montreal about 10 years, and I gotta admit I fall in love with Boulevard Lasalle, Saint-Joseph, Lakeshore and on. Lovely place to just drive around, bike, and walk with lots of peaceful parks. I now even consider to buy a house in the area.
I grew up in lachine, best part lakeshore of the whole island in my opinion
I've caughy several 30 to 40 lb. sturgeon right there. I also caught several good highd right there too.
Used to live 2 minutes from there! If they would of never jacked up the prices. I would still be there. My old place went from 800$ to 1300$ a month.
Eyyyy lachtown estii
On dirait qu'il y a une montagne qui se cache derri√®re la brume du lac.
Omg so nice to see this, been living here all my life so far and right next to that exact spot! I should go take more photos around the area ^^ nice pic! (Also if anyone would wanna meet up for some photo shoots around here, pls I need friends ( ¬¥‚àÄÔΩÄ)
Those morons with their graffiti.... Is there a way I can go and clean that up?
That thing needs some beautification. Paint job, crest, anything other than concrete blocks.
Very good year to visit, construction started on the Lachine Canal 200 years ago in 1821.
Wow
I just moved very close to there :D
Greetings! Hopefully, we will get to travel soon :-)
Same here! Missing my Hometown from Seattle.
It's not on the canal. It's the Wharf at the bottom on 34eme av. Or  across from the dairy Queen
Better get in soon. Lachine was the last bastion of "affordable" property. In the last few years it's really shot up like crazy.
Even in the lower avenues where rents were very cheap everything has crept to 1200-1400$ a month.
I'm down whenever you want. DM me.
God willing. If they would just open the border by April, I'd be thrilled.  Right in time for Montreal to come out of hibernation.
Montreal's real-estate price increase is relatively slow compare to where I am from, but I can definitely see that market's on the move.
[deleted]
It is insane how much it went up within 2 3 years
Consider yourself lucky! You sound like a landlords dream. Long term good tennant
It was sheltered for years because the area east of 32nd was always seen as a bit "slummy" but in the last 15 years it's started to be really cleaned up. New projects everywhere especially the almost 7 figure townhouses at Villanova... You got a massive project planned at that end of the canal right in the thick of a lower income area that is gentrifing fast. That area of Lachine is very under developed but they will change in the coming years. Only shame is the city just can't figure out what to do with Notre Dame between 6e and 18e. It's a bit of a wasteland... 
However easy access by car, bus and bike to downtown and west island. Easy access to the 20 and 13. Close to the airport... Good amount of grocery stores and restos.
[deleted]
It's non violent but has a cast of characters that's for sure. Far from a no go zone. It's actually perfectly fine. Duff court area is the one to actually avoid. I live 500m from where that photo was taken üßê
Thats it. Duff court! I now live over the Mercier Bridge where housing is more affordable than the Island.
You know what's funny is Ch√¢teauguay/ area was cheapppp as hell for years because of that bridge. Again in the last few years it's really shot up.
Haha!  Exactly they noticed everybody was coming here so decided to jack up the prices.  To be fair as well, they have been building a lot. I found a nice condo by the water over here in the old part of town. I highly doubt the prices will shoot up as high as they did in Lachine. 
I lived on 62th or 64th avenue if my mind is correct.  My place literally went from 820 a month to 1020, this was 3 years ago and I recently just checked it out because its back on the market and saw that it is going for 1350
Ah, yes, I too remember when they activated the Complexe Desjardins Death Laser to smash our enemies.
Montr√©al, 1 B.C. (coloris√©)
This picture is so perfect at representing Montreal, the building, the nice places ..... a destroyed building/road with a ton of orange cones.

Nice
Did you see the two guys on the little dirt bikes sowing catwalks? Haha
yeah it was nice today!
Nice picture

Sometimes there are even bigger gatherings and lots of students and young people partying

Everyone at risk is vaccinated now, give it up.
Ok doomer.
[removed]
And because of this mindset we are still in red
When our ICUs aren‚Äôt overwhelmed with COVID patients I will.
Sure, that‚Äôs why we are still in red right?
Where did you get this information? Personnally I just got vaccinated on Friday and I booked my appointment as soon as they announced we were added to the vaccination groups, so I'm pretty sure I was not the last chronically ill person to be vaccinated
hmm, I wonder if mask-wearing worked during the protests? 
nah, let's continue to gather maskless in parks for our hYGiENE de VIe :)
False. You are assuming that the majority of cases are from illegal gatherings, which is not the case according to official data.
No we were in the red because they took this long to close down the airports.
Our ICUs are always overwhelmed no matter what. It has nothing to do with covid. There's a lot of people who go to the hospital the first time they cough "just in case". These people clog the system constantly.
You can downvote me all you want, it doesn't change the facts. only 1-5% of people infected actually needs to go to the hospital.
You're assuming the government always does rational decisions.
This but unironically. Yes. Let's encourage people to gather maskless in parks. It doesn't lead to contagion and prevents indoor gatherings, which are way more dangerous.
Don't conflate outbreaks and cases. Different metrics.
My point exactly, "Who cares".
You‚Äôre right, our ICUs were in a right state before the pandemic, but right now it‚Äôs a complete disaster and we are barely coping. It‚Äôs not just about numbers, it‚Äôs the effect that it has on the workers, yes we are doing well in Montreal right now but because of that we are sending healthcare workers elsewhere in the province.
I have a family member that works at one of the hospitals and believe me the situation is still very bad even though things are improving.
How much effort does it take to slap on a piece of fabric though? Really? The bar is SO LOW and yet here we are
*Could the mods please add an illustration tag? I don‚Äôt think my design classifies as any of the options.*

Merci beaucoup!
I'm Asian and it happened to me last March 2020. I was pushed and fell to the ground. No one helped me up or asked if I was ok. Right downtown next to McGill.
C'est rendu assez trash dans certains coins du plateau depuis 12 mois...
Edit : j'ai relu l'article et un passage m'a affect√© : 
‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt breathe, I couldn‚Äôt see, so I couldn‚Äôt unlock my phone to call the police,‚Äù he said, adding that no one in the area took it upon themselves to give him a hand. ‚ÄúI heard people walking by and no one helped, it was really weird.‚Äù
La derni√®re partie fait mal. Une des plus grandes forces de l'humain est l'entraide. Apparemment les montr√©alais sont d√©shumanis√©s, probablement habitu√©s de fermer les yeux sur les personnes qui ont besoin d'aide, qu'ils ne savent plus dans quelles situations ils doivent intervenir (comme celle-ci), et d'autres o√π c'est devenu normal/recommand√© de ne pas intervenir (gens qui qu√™tent ou dorment dans la rue, bagarres, confrontations et insultes, etc).
D'un c√¥t√©, si on intervient personnellement pour chaque "personne n√©c√©ssitant de l'aide" en ville, on se rendra jamais √† destination, sauf peut-√™tre certains jours. 
Mais de l'autre c√¥t√©, √ßa cr√©e des situations comme √ßa...
Assez d√©go√ªtant comme attaque, en esp√©rant que les assaillants soient √©ventuellement attrap√©s.
This is becoming more and more frequent sadly. This topic was brought up last year on this sub and r/canada shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic started but nobody paid any attention. That was also around the BLM movement. I guess Asian lives don't matter much? Sad.
This Korean guy got lucky. Last year, a Korean guy got slashed in the throat around Vendome metro. This is horrifying.
My GF is Asian and I worry about this shit every day. It's so stupid and nonsensical...
Shameful acts!
In the Plateau, two asian people were also attacked by five or six men. The attack was very brutal, leaving at least one person's face completely covered in blood and the people who were there told me that it was definitely a hate crime. Not reported anywhere.
√áa c'est √† 5 minutes de chez moi, et je suis aussi un homme asiatique     
Bon...
Doublement triste parce que personne lui est venu en aide.
This is just so sad
This is so distressing because....this man probably lived in Montreal for years, possibly his whole life.  What relationship does he have to Covid?  Absolutely none.
For that matter, what do any Asian people have to do with the emergence of the covid virus really?  None, as far as we know .  Evidence so far is that emerged naturally from animals.
It's very difficult for me to understand the mindset of folks who decide to do this.  Just why?  And what outcome are they hoping for?
Come on Montreal, let's do better
WTF! Si jamais je suis temoin d'un geste raciste de la sorte, bonne chance pour le gars!
non seulement c‚Äôest trash mais sur le plateau je suis √©tonn√©
Fucking hell.
I wish we could all just get along. This is depressing.
I was thinking about moving there but not anymore
some people disgust me. the ignorance and hatred in people really has no bounds.
Calisse. (C'est tout. C'est mon seul commentaire. Aussi, des fois, j'ha√Øs les gens.)
It‚Äôs time to start crowdsourcing surveillance footage. Definitely a few residents have some camera footage of the suspects.
Aren‚Äôt pepper sprays illegal in Quebec unless it‚Äôs labeled as bear spray or something? I‚Äôm planning to keep one for a protection at this point
[removed]
Nobody caught anything on film? :@
>It was some type of pepper spray ‚Äî thick, oily and orange, kind of  like paint, James explained. (James is not is real name, which is being  withheld for safety reasons.)  
>  
>‚ÄúI did a bunch of research  afterwards, and it appears to be some type of like, military pepper gel,  just by what was left on my clothing and the colour of it,‚Äù he said.
Military... les nerfs, il d√©crit du bear spray qui se vend dans toutes les boutiques de plein air.
I'm not surprised this happened. Asian people, like myself, should expect more of these incidents happening in the foreseeable future. There will be "copycat crime" that will be modeled after this one. This criminal act does not represent the average Montrealer as these are acts that are perpetrated by those mentally impaired to cope and deal with what's going on around the world. However, living in Montreal for the past 7 years, I have felt that there is an undercurrent of Anti-Asian sentiment among some Montrealers. It's definitely out there. And it's not "Oops, I didn't know what I said could be considered as racist"-kind of racism. It's more the "I know exactly that what I'm doing is racist and I would like to inflict this upon you" kind.
Ready for the downvoting, but your typical plateau Montrealer is of a cowardly breed of self-centered sub-human. 
No apologies due or given. This incident is disgusting.
black lives matter not asian
Genuine question, how do we know he was attacked because of his race? I don‚Äôt see anything specific about the attacker verbally abusing him on his race. This could have well just been a druggie, this article seems to start with a conclusion and frame the evidence around it. 
I still feel sorry for the bloke though, pepper spray in the face doesn‚Äôt seem great
Terrible crime, though not clear that it was necessarily because he was Asian. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if it turns out to be the case, just we don‚Äôt know. If someone read it was clearly a hate crime, and has proof, would love to see it
Edit: people on this thread thinking it‚Äôs controversial to ask for proof other than an article title is shocking. hope you all realize that this type of thinking is exactly what helps mobs convict people (often minorities) due to circumstance with no proof. grow the fuck up and wait for evidence before reaching conclusions you have no clue if are true or not.
cue the downvotes from ‚Äúoutraged‚Äù people usually outraged about the central park five. you are doing exactly what bigots do. wake up!
[removed]
I‚Äôm not here to doubt racism towards people of Asian decent exists. It does. My experience with the gazettes coverage of it is for better or worse vague. The victim in this scenario said they were confident it was racially motivated because nothing was stolen. They also did not hear any racial slurs etc. I don‚Äôt doubt the attackers may have assumed the victim was Asian and older therefore less likely to fight back or had other preconceived ideas. I have also seen the gazette (I think) let the owners of ganadarra say their break ins were racially motivated when the restaurant was possibly located on a one way street with fewer people at the time of robbery. These are obviously both significant and news worthy events, however, there is a lot of space to consider other factors in both scenarios
I'm sorry that you had to experience that
Quebec has a real racism problem and it seems that people don‚Äôt want to address it. 
That being said, YES, it‚Äôs everywhere in Canada too. 
Sorry you went through that.
Je trouve √ßa horrible, √ßa me fait peur pour ma m√®re d'un certain √¢ge qui prend le m√©tro seul parfois. J'ai peur que si un jour elle a un malaise, les gens la laisse crever l√†.
Es-tu aller porter plainte √† ton poste de quartier?
I'm so sorry. Don't know if it's any consolation but if I or any of the people I know were there, we would've helped. Not all montrealers are like that. Take care!
I'm Asian, too, but honestly I'm not surprised that nobody helped you. I was yelled to "go back to f-ing Chinatown!" by this Quebecois guy in La Banquise and the employee just laughed together with him. nobody acted like he was doing something wrong etc. I'm not even Chinese. 
I have lived in a liberal US city as well. If the same thing happened over there, people would have yelled at that guy.
This means that the level of Anti-Asian sentiment in Canada is generally high, even though it doesn't externalize because Canadian culture is more PC. I think Vancouver real-estate price is blamed on the Chinese and it is true that the Mainland Chinese people are buying a lot of property in Canada. This I do not approve of myself. However, there is a very racist element to this because I'm pretty sure other groups have speculated on the Vancouver and Toronto real-estate as well.
This is partly what society has come to.
This is my opinion, but I really think it to be true. The fact that no one helped you, I don't think it's cause you're asian. I feel that societies all over the world, especially in cities, mind their own business so much that it goes to the extent of turning a blind eye on everything. Including even acknowledging other human beings close by walking on the street.
In some ways it's good, you can do what you want and no one will say anything. But that's also the problem, whatever you do, you don't exist, no one exists anymore.
I'm so, so sorry. Even more sorry that no one tried to help or check if you were ok.
I‚Äôm so sorry this happened. So disappointing that no one would at least help you. I‚Äôm a montrealer and expect better from my fellow citizens.
Wtf! How can someone watch this happen and not even approach to ask if the person is alright or need any kind of help?
Honetement j‚Äôaurais aid√© vous! Je suis vraiment d√©sol√© d‚Äôentendre √ßa!

J'ai malheureusement de gros doutes.
Le gouvernement Chinois est calissement a blamer , oublier pas que c'est un gouvernement totalitaire a la Nazi , le gouvernement....
 pas les gens asiatiques faut etre moron blamer les gens a cause de leur couleur de peau caliss.
They ran articles about racism acts against Asians in  La Presse, CTV and CBC only to remove them from first page the very next day. I emailed them all for an explanation and no answers from any of them. 
Crimes against Asians are brushed under the carpet. They are not as newsworthy as an attack against others.
Love the house foundation joke hahah
Saw this in NDG. Found it pretty cool to have social commentary masquerading as Halloween decorations!
Un jour Terrebonne va avoir sa piste cyclable... Un jour.
I love this house. 
Also. Who do I vote for to get my bike path back? We have so many candidates and I haven‚Äôt heard anything from any of them. 
I have a parking spot, and I pay hella taxes so don‚Äôt even ducking start.
They are gonna get fined for it not being 60% larger in French.

Nice to see people having fun with it. Honestly I dont think my area will have many kids trick or treating but I hope those of you who can will try and make up for last year for the lil'ones
What are the halloween guidelines this year?
[deleted]
Ohh nooo the foundation one. That one hits.
when your social commentary is prepackaged by media corporations
Basically applies to all homes in NDGüòÇ
I was going to ask but it looked like NDG. A lot of fun decorations but I haven't seen that one.
Je suis f√©ru de v√©lo moi-m√™me, mais avec une piste cyclable sur Notre-Dame-De-Gr√¢ce et autre sur Maisonneuve, c'est d√©bile d'en avoir une sur Terrebonne. C'est litt√©ralement 4mn se rendre de la piste de Notre-Dame-De-Gr√¢ce √† Terrebonne, donc autant passer par Notre-Dame-De-Gr√¢ce. La congestion que cr√©erait une √©ventuelle piste sur Terrebonne (qui est pas large) cr√©erait plus de danger que de bien. Surtout devant l'√©cole. Trop c'est comme pas assez.
For Montr√©al, I'd say the candidate most favourable to bike infrastructure is Val√©rie Plante.
It's ok it doesn't include the word pasta
[Here](https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/hand-washing-no-yelling-trick-or-treat-quebec-offers-up-pandemic-halloween-rules-1.5634401) they are. We will not do the bag thing, we're all vaccinated and don't want to create a mountain of discarded plastic bags...
I'm.... Not sure I get the joke?
Imagine thinking you are the outsider when billion-dollar corporations are on your side.
Je croyais qu'il parlait de la ville de Terrebonne. √áa fait pas mal plus de sens qu'une personne de NDG parle de la rue. My bad.
La distance entre Terrebonne et Notre-Dame-De-Gr√¢ce est assez grande. Je trouve cela absurde comme argument de dire qu'il ne devrait pas y avoir plus de piste cyclable sous pr√©texte qu'il y en a une deux p√¢t√©s de maison plus loin. Si les gens font du v√©lo sur Terrebonne, il devrait y avoir une infrastructure pour qu'ils puissent le faire en s√©curit√©, point √† la ligne. √áa n'emp√™che pas les voitures de circuler. Le v√©lo devrait √™tre consid√©r√© comme un moyen de transport l√©gitime, et c'est en cr√©ant une infrastructure d√©di√©e qu'on y arrivera (comme les endroits civilis√©s i.e. Amsterdam). On ne fait jamais d'argument similaire pour les chars "les voitures ont juste √† se d√©placer deux p√¢t√©s de maison plus loin pour √©viter les pistes cyclables". Mais ton commentaire refl√®te le fait que en Am√©rique, le char est le roi. C'est malheureux, et tout les monde y perd, y compris les automobilistes.
EDIT: ta photo est nice par contre, thx for sharing.
Val needs to go, Sue needs to go, etc...
https://youtu.be/FJiHdnD_uHE
or that you are "speaking truth to power"
Aaaahh! Je suis d√©sol√©, j'ai mal compris! Mille pardon! Je pensais qu'on parlait de la rue Terrebonne o√π il y a eu un projet pilote qui a mal tourn√© (d'o√π mon commentaire)... Pardon l'ami!
Nous sommes une famille de quatre, avec une seule voiture et quatre v√©los, et quatre cartes STM. Alors non, pour nous la voiture n'est pas reine, c'est une jugement h√¢tif de ta part √† mon sujet que de penser que pour moi, l'auto est reine. Quand on y r√©fl√©chit, on conclue qu'il doit y avoir de la place pour les autos, les pi√©tons, les v√©los et le transport en commun, tous ont leur place, surtout dans un pays hivernal √† population vieillissante (les besoins de d√©placements sont multiples et diff√©rents, et les client√®les pas les m√™mes). Le projet pilote d√©sastreux sur Terrebonne, n'a fait que prouver qu'on peut pas multiplier les pistes cyclables sans logique et sans planification qui prends en compte toutes les parties prenantes, et tous les besoins. Et puis, en v√©lo, c'est 4 minutes de Terrebonne √† Notre-Dame-De-Gr√¢ce, si pour toi √ßa qualifie de 'assez grande' eh bien soit. Mais s√©rieusement, c'est la porte d'√† c√¥t√©. 
Edit: comparer Amsterdam (que j'adore) et Montr√©al, c'est comparer des oranges √† des noix de coco. Il n'y a pas neige et verglas 6 mois par ann√©e √† Amsterdam, et c'est plat. Donc c'est bien plus faisable le v√©lo pour eux.
Edit 2: merci pour le compliment sur la photo!
Le rue Cavendish devrait avoir un piste avant Terrebonne pour vraiment connecter les autres pistes cyclables.
OMG yes, this one had completely slipped from memory! A bona fide classic! üòÇ
Holy hell
> surtout dans un pays hivernal √† population vieillissante 
Un argument souvent r√©p√©t√©, m√™me si rien ne soutien l'id√©e qu'il n'est pas possible de faire du v√©lo l'hiver. Ce qu'il faut, c'est un r√©seau de pistes cyclables adapt√© pour des conditions hivernales. [Et √ßa existe: voir l'exemple de Oulu en Finlande ou environ 50% de la population fait du v√©lo toute l'ann√©e.](https://youtu.be/Uhx-26GfCBU) 
>  Cela ne m'emp√™che cependant pas de r√©fl√©chir et de voir qu'il doit y avoir de la place pour les autos, les pi√©tons, les v√©los et le transport en commun, tous ont leur place, 
Sauf que, faire du v√©lo √† Montr√©al, c'est souvent une activit√© dangereuse. Justement parce qu'on doit toujours partager le terrain avec des voitures. Je ne trouve pas du tout que les v√©los ont leur place. La quasi totalit√© des infrastructures routi√®re √† Montr√©al sont d√©di√©s aux voitures, et on consid√®re que le peu qu'il reste est suffisant pour les v√©los. C'est pour cette raison que le v√©lo n'est pas un moyen transport pris au s√©rieux, et le manque d'infrastructure d√©di√© refl√®te bien cette r√©alit√©. 
Le projet pilote de Terrebonne a √©t√© fait h√¢tivement, mais ce qu'il d√©montre par dessus tout, c'est le fait que les gens refusent de se d√©barasser de leurs voitures. Le probl√®me fondamental, c'est celui-l√†. Les voitures pollues, font du traffic, contribue √† l'√©talement urbain et joue contre le commerce de proximit√©. Sans compter toutes les d√©penses en infrastructures qui y sont li√©es. Moins de voiture, c'est incontestablement la meilleure chose pour l'urbanisme, et c'est pour cette raison que des villes [comme Paris (ou la circulation automobile a diminu√© de moiti√© depuis 1990) et la plupart des villes europ√©ennes](https://www.paris.fr/pages/reforme-du-stationnement-repenser-60-hectares-privatises-par-les-voitures-18146) prennent cette approche. En Am√©rique, on commence tranquillement √† r√©aliser l'erreur d'avoir fait du char le moyen de transport de pr√©dilection, mais on a beaucoup de retard. Il faut un changement de culture, et la r√©sistance envers les pistes cyclables nuit beaucoup √† Montr√©al. 
> Et puis, en v√©lo, c'est 4 minutes de Terrebonne √† Notre-Dame-De-Gr√¢ce, si pour toi √ßa qualifie de 'assez grande' eh bien soit.
Encore une fois, il faut r√©fl√©chir autrement. Un passage s√©curitaire pour les v√©los devrait √™tre la norme, et non l'exception. Je ne devrais pas avoir besoin de faire 1km pour circuler sur un passage s√©curitaire.
> Edit: comparer Amsterdam (que j'adore) et Montr√©al, c'est comparer des oranges √† des noix de coco. Il n'y a pas neige et verglas 6 mois par ann√©e √† Amsterdam, et c'est plat.
Totalement faux: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uhx-26GfCBU
De dire qu'on ne peut pas comparer Montr√©al aux villes europ√©ennes, c'est un argument sans queue ni t√™te. Pour quelle raison exactement? Si on accepte le fait que Amsterdam a une meilleure infrastructure que la n√¥tre, qu'est-ce qui nous emp√™che de reproduire leur approche? Il n'y a aucune raison.
Bien s√ªr, ce sont des villes avec des r√©alit√©s diff√©rentes, mais il n'y a pas de raison pour laquelle on ne pourrait pas mettre l'emphase sur les transports alternatifs comme ils le font.

Oulu en Finlande a de la vrai neige.
> m√™me si rien ne soutien l'id√©e qu'il n'est pas possible de faire du v√©lo l'hiver
C'est possible, mais la majorit√© de personnes ne *veulent* pas en faire l'hiver.
Ils ne veulent pas en faire l'hiver parce que l'infrastructure pour le faire de fa√ßon s√©curitaire est absente. L'exemple de la Finlande d√©montre que si tu cr√©es un r√©seau de pistes cyclables adapt√© pour l'hiver, les gens en font.
La *majorit√©* ne veulent pas en faire parce qu'il fa frette, c'est tout.
C'est frette et √ßa glisse en crisse! M√™me avec du sel partout (ce qui d√©molie les bicyclettes, by the way)
Pcq ils n'ont pas essay√©, en 3 minutes tu n'as plus frette.
Donc comment tu expliques que 50% de la population de certaines villes nordiques le fait? Nous on est des tata qui sont pas capable de g√©rer l'hiver et eux non? 
T'es capables de marcher en hiver? De faire du ski? Pourquoi tu serais pas capable de faire du v√©lo si l'infrastructure est adapt√© en cons√©quence?
La seule raison pourquoi le v√©lo d'hiver n'est pas practicable, c'est √† cause du manque d'infrastructure. Prend le temps de t'informer et regarder la vid√©o que j'ai post√© √† deux reprises sur ce thread. Toutes les √©tudes d'urbanisme sur le v√©lo d'hiver d√©montre que le froid n'est pas la raison pourquoi les gens ne font pas de v√©lo d'hiver.
> Donc comment tu expliques que 50% de la population de certaines villes nordiques le fait? Nous on est des tata qui sont pas capable de g√©rer l'hiver et eux non?
Diff√©rentes circonstances, mais les villes nordiques n'ont pas le m√™me layout routiers qu'ici. Regarde la diff√©rence de traffic sur les pistes d√©neig√©es *ici* hiver/√©t√©. C'est pas l'infrastructure qui fait que ce traffic chute...
> T'es capables de marcher en hiver? De faire du ski? Pourquoi tu serais pas capable de faire du v√©lo si l'infrastructure est adapt√© en cons√©quence?
Tu reviens au point d'infrastructure, alors je reviens au point que *la majorit√© de gens ne veulent pas en faire l'hiver.*
> La seule raison pourquoi le v√©lo d'hiver n'est pas practicable, c'est √† cause du manque d'infrastructure.
Non, c'est parce qu'y fa frette qu'ils ne **VEULENT pas en faire**, tu comprends la diff√©rence entre vouloir et pouvoir?
I took this picture last night from la Grande Roue de Montr√©al
Fun fact, there is a city rule that states that no skyscraper can be higher than the Mt Royal you can see in the background.
mmm, i love the med density
Never had been the most interesting skyline. Nice shot though !
Damn, that's awesome
Added my personal touch üòâ:

Yessir
I can see the Montreal tower from my school tho, college Laval ;))
how....? So good
What's with the diagonal lines at right?
Think that city would look much nicer with all the money Alberta gives them!
This is a good thing.
Au contraire, je trouve la superposition gratte-ciels / montagne super unique et belle. Et je trouve qu'on a une bonne proportion de gratte-ciels reconnaissables.
The skyline from the old port isn't as awesome as from the Champlain bridge IMHO.
Very nice!
The ones in the right? They are lense flare
Quebec/Ontario cities don't get any of that money, it all goes into provincial programs. Unlike the original Quebec money that was used to kickstart the whole Albertan economy.
Alberta is a net recipient of Canadian federal government, even worse than Quebec nowadays.
Agreed. We have some nice, unique skyscrapers, but not in an over abundance that makes it look cluttered. With the mountain and the water as the backdrops, I think it‚Äôs a terrific is skyline.
Ah! Thanks.
You should do some research! You are misinformed
Agree 100%!
Who do you think financed the exploration of western Canada? The construction of roads. The armed forces to take over the territory from the native. The original oil pumpjacks? Eastern Canada. Equalization payments are just a return on investment. Of course, they are also a gesture of solidarity with poorer provinces like The Maritimes whose economy is more seasonal.
I miss this place and the beautiful cherry blossom pic-nics !
I was there too today!!!
Super beau !

Beautiful place. Took my gf yesterday but we only seen half of it
I hope they end the construction on Pie-IX soon, makes it impossible to find parking.

Can we get a night train to NYC too?
m'a'l cr√®r ma m'a'l v√®r.
Apparently this was corrected to "high-frequency": [https://twitter.com/richard680news/status/1412122260450779139?s=20](https://twitter.com/richard680news/status/1412122260450779139?s=20)
&#x200B;
Which, while somewhat disappointing, makes sense as new "high-speed" lines are apparently generally considered to be > 250km/h: https://uic.org/passenger/highspeed/#General-definitions-of-highspeed
It's NOT high SPEED rail / "HSR" (the trains will only go 200kph) 
It's high FREQUENCY rail "HFR" (as in, there will be many trains a day)
HFR needs dedicated track, which is what we're getting; HSR needs high speed dedicated track which is several times more expensive to both build and maintain 
Still cool and a move in the right direction, but don't want people expecting European TGV, because that's not what we're getting. (It will be a nice ride in the new VIA Corridor fleet though!)
J'ai creuser un peu et serieusement... J'trouve que ce projet l√† est "bof".
Premi√®rement, ils parlent de 177kmh, c'est la vitesse max de leur nouvelle locomotique qu'ils ont pas encore(selon leur propre brochure). Les locomotives que via operent presentement vont a 160kmh max. 
177kmh, c'est vite, mais pas si vite que √ßa. Des trains a 200+kmh dans les ann√©es 50-60 √ßa existait deja. On parlera pas de TGV europ√©ens...
√Ä mon humble avis, tr√®s bon call d'utiliser des track "normales" pour que √ßa soit backward compatible. Mais si vous etes pour faire des track juste pour √ßa, faite √ßa assez drette pour que √ßa puisse rouler a 250kmh, achetez des trains capable d'atteindre ces vitesse l√†....
Mes 2 cennes.
Cool. I'm sure my great grand-children will love it when it opens.
I hope this happens!
Trains will start running just after low-cost daycare, pharmacare, proportional representation, clean water on reserves...
Monorail!
That‚Äôs it? 200 Km/h‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know seems kinda slow for 2021
Oh, I smell [another study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10cXpd8haQQ)!
Why just 200km/h? Germans and the French are traveling 270-312km\h on rails since I can remember.
Laughable . Via RAIL can‚Äôt even use the Mount-Royal tunnel anymore .
absolutely will never happen and if you believe it will you are being fooled.
Announcement # 12 194 for this train line. It must be a running joke in the government by now.
Too slow
of course
Even if it happens the ticket will cost an arm and a leg.
Pff... I do 300 km/h all the time between Montreal and Toronto. Jk.
Honestly how is that high speed? I guess that will get us there in half the time?
ITT: Lots of people that have never heard politicians talk around election time.
This is ridiculous. The Governments of Canada, Qu√©bec and Ontario [commissioned a report in 2011](http://www.bv.transports.gouv.qc.ca/mono/1102522/01_Rapport_final.pdf) and the conclusion was that 300kmh+ would be the best option between the cities.
This proposal is literally 23kmh faster than what VIA is proposing with HFR. Why can't we just bite the bullet and build something right the first time that actually could be the backbone of a decent rail network in Southern Ontario and Qu√©bec. An electrified trunk line with spur lines that use dual mode locomotives.  If we spend $10B now, there's 0% chance we get the money for retrofits in my lifetime for a proper high speed line.
That being said, its no secret why the fed won't just do it and when I worked at VIA a few years back, it was an open secret why they wouldn't fund proper HSR.
Hint: YYZ-YUL-YOW is a cash cow for airlines.
Edit: Apparently we're just talking about HFR here again... Everyone, please write your MPs so we can upgrade this half assed solution to something we have studied over and over again to be good for the Canadian, Qu√©becois and Ontarian economies...
Bon, jasons 2 minutes...on a un systeme de metro sur pneumatique qui marche juste a l'interieur, un systeme d'autobus, un systeme de train de banlieue sur des track de train normale,
Je veux des trains, mais un projet de cette envergure, annonc√© comme √ßa, juste un tweet, tout est d√©j√† d√©cid√© √† huis clos sans d√©bats et on attends de se faire livrer les d√©tails comme si c'√©tait les tablettes de Mo√Øse?
Les lib√©raux copient la m√©thode Legault
TGV in Europe runs at 300km/h...
On est loin d' un TGV. 
En fait il manque 100km/h pour appeler √ßa un train rapide...
Do you mean a high speed train, the same as what they did in Morocco between Tangier and Casablanca, Morocco, roughly 550 kms?
If Morocco (Africa) can do it, I‚Äôm pretty sure Canada can do it too.
I‚Äôm not even talking about China here or any other countries in Asia.
The project is estimated to cost $4B as of 2019. Likely that's gone up, and don't forget to factor in incompetence, graft, and general cost increases, and this is likely a $6B project. 
VIA also last announced a loss of $115M in the Quebec to Toronto corridor. Tickets are already subsidized by the government. I guess we need to hope that this governments massive investment will help the company break even? I'm a bit skeptical. Can't wait to read the article on how SNC fairly won a bid for some major work.
what year is it? lmfao‚Ä¶(eye roll)
Eille si seulement hahahaha.
Montreal to Toronto will still be as much as a plane ticket I bet
Un projet d'une autre √©poque qui ne fera pas changer les comportements, gagner 20 minutes sur un trajet n'est pas suffisant pour que les gens d√©laissent la voiture... Si on est pr√™t √† mettre 10 milliards pour un 3e lien, 15 milliards pour un TGV c'est encore raisonnable.
That‚Äôs pretty cool
It‚Äôs about time!

i'd have mtl -¬≠> nyc much before mtl -> tor
why the fuck would i go to toronto
That would be nice

Amen to that üôå
that first please.
kan*
High frequency will trick enough voters.
The current via trains get up to about 160.  If they were more often and a bit quicker, that would be nice.
Fair point. 
"up to" 200KM does not mean Montr√©al-Toronto in 3 h
It means the train could reach 200K in ideal conditions on an empty track if it was a race.
Currently our "up to 177KM/h" trains do that in 5h:30, the same tame it takes in a car 
And obviously the trains cannot go faster than the train ahead of them on the same track. So maybe it takes 5h instead, on the condition that every engine has been upgraded already.
So the truth is ..... They announce they will buy new engines and it wont change a thing concretely for users.
And I am certain they already know who to buy them from and we will find suspicious ties between the engine providers and the current administration.
Sorry folks I'me am just the messenger, do not blame the weatherman for forecasting rain!
don't worry with VIA in charge we will be paying high-speed prices for this regardless
On serait d√ª pour en remplacer beaucoup des tracks, ne serait-ce que parce que leur emplacement est probl√©matique. On pense √† celles qui traversent les villages (on se rappelle de M√©gantic) et Montr√©al avec les gros probl√®mes de circulation que √ßa cause dans toute la ville de devoir traverser les voies ferr√©es avec des viaducs.
Il y aurait beaucoup de gains divers √† faire l√†.

EDIT 3: Shoutout to all the amazing front line workers, you're all heroes! Merci a tous les travaileuses/travailleurs de premiere ligne, vous etes tous des heros!
Dad took the opportunity this morning as he just turned 55. Get it now if you can.
It's a shame they don't open vaccination to everyone yet as so many doses seem to sleep in storage, although I understand the reasons why. I'd (personally) still take my odds with the blood clot instead of risking getting Covid.
If it weren't a pandemic that might be a great place to meet well informed middle aged folks.

Same in Lasalle. Small line up at 8:30 am but was out in just over an hour
For those who don't know ( because I didn't), it does not have to be the centre based on your postal code. Lasalle was closer for me than the Palais. The person didn't care when I gave her my postal code.
Also it is the year that you turn 55. If your birthday has not passed yet but you were born in 1966 or earlier you're good.
my dad doesn‚Äôt want to go! he‚Äôs only 55 and fears this vaccine might interfere with his health since there‚Äôs been a lot of debates about it... the government isn‚Äôt doing a great job reassuring citizens about Astrazeneca
thanks for sharing!!
Thank you for sharing!!  I hope people snatch these up quickly.
I made my appointment at Pharmaprix for next Wednesday through Clic-sante. I'd rather not stand in line at some shopping centre, thanks. I was able to get an appointment within a week, and there was a ton of space open all over the place.
Read this post and went to dollard arena in LaSalle   no waiting, took maybe 5 minutes and a 15 minute where they watch you. 
Awesome very happy to have first dose. Also have appointment for second dose.
Wow.  They gave out coupons for spots in Quebec City, and today's places were filled up in less than an hour first thing this morning.
Im 27 and if i could i would take the vaccin asap
Is there any information about the vaccination of people with chronic diseases?
Mes 2 parents et mon beau-p√®re ont eu Aztra Zeneca (COVISHIELD) et personne n'a eu aucun sympt√¥me. Ils ont entre 67 et 71 ans - un est diab√©tique, l'autre a des probl√®mes cardiaques et finalement ma mere a surv√©cu un cancer.  
EDIT: Personne n'a eu d'effets secondaires et tout va tr√®s bien.
How do you find this information out? [This page](https://portal3.clicsante.ca/covid-vaccination-ouverture) is still saying under 60. Is there another page I should be looking at?
Anyone has a fake ID to provide? I'll do the makeup and costumes
Went to the Montreal General this morning at 8 am. Everyone was lovely and I was out of there at 8:45.
Can we show up? I'm not 55+
Tell me you failed math in high school without telling me you failed math.
  - I refuse to take the AZ vaccine, I want the other one.
Everyone I know is scared to take the AZ vaccine.. they want one of the others ones instead
I don't get why other countries have banned this vaccine and now they wonder why nobody is going to take it here maybe people don't want to die
Thanks. But no thanks.
[removed]
Do they accept people from Laval? My dad is born in 1966 and his birthday hasn't passed yet, he's 54. He went to a place like this in Laval this morning and got refused because his birthday hasn't passed yet.
Same! I wish we could give informed consent and just go!
yep and the blood clot risk is very low and you can take aspirin low dosage if you worry
the only thing that worries me about AZ is its efficacy with some variants but its better than nothing
My dad also went this morning, I'm relieved he will have some protection soon. 
I would take the AstraZeneca vaccine at this point. I'm in the age range of women affected by the blood clot...but I can't live like this anymore. I'll take the risk, but we don't have that choice at the moment.
30 cases out of 5M don't scare me twice as much as taking an advil.
Did you just say you'd rather have blood clots than Covid?
Everyone was very sweet, I agree, but, the damn masks... seriously messes with your style! All jokes aside I thought all the personel were amazing, everything went fast and smooth and all smiles!
Health Canada has dissuaded young people from taking this vaccine though
Health Canada has banned it for people under 55 due to an investigation into blood clots.
It's not a case of relaxing restrictions, they are absolutely not allowed to give it to people < 55.
[deleted]
It's not a matter of opening the next priorioty group after the 55+ are done.  The AZ vaccine is simply not to be used on people aged 54 and below.  But that could change eyt again... we'll see ;)
Agreed, this age limit is really stupid. An obvious more sensible solution is to allow everyone to apply for vaccine, and then prioritize the older applicants (or whoever need it more). This at least guarantees no waste of vaccine and space. Don't know why they made that choice, maybe less work for them?
Don't get your knickers in a bunch. It's the first day they've opened for the 55 plus. They can't do everyone in one day. They had huge line ups at the Olympic stadium this morning. From all accounts, things are going along pretty well. No big line ups at this particular place doesn't mean they don't have a steady influx of people.
They give you a lot of suggestions online and a lot of the spots for the next week or so were already taken at locations near me. But I was still able to get one within a week.
Obviously I don't know your dad's health challenges but on average he has about a 0.00005 chance of developing a clot with the stats that we know about. Ask him to compare that with the chances of contracting covid.
169 out of 34 million...  "The total for cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) were recorded as of April 4 out of 34 million doses of the shot administered in the European Economic Area"  [source](https://ottawacitizen.com/news/world/eu-drug-regulator-link-astrazeneca-vaccine-and-blood-clots)
Have him consider how contracting COVID might interfere with his health.

What is the delay for the second dose of AZ?
Congratulations!
28 and same
I believe it starts next week but only for specific types of disease (immune disease, cancer)

Basically we got skipped I think..
For 55+ it is only in place without appointment. There is a list somewhere. I read it in an article of LaPresse. Ma m√®re (58 ans) est all√© tant√¥t √† la clinique de Ste-Agathe et il lui on donn√© rendez-vous √† 13h30.
The full list of AZ no appointment vaccination places in Quebec is [here.

sans rdv for AZ for 55+. so you can't make an appointment for this vaccine.
i'm confused too, i just looked yesterday and it was 60+, would it be possible for a 55 year old to be vaccinated without appointment for any of the vaccines?
Beautiful! You can even see the Christmas tree.

Je commence √† me demander qui est le plus √©ternel entre le Christ et ce dude l√†.
Why don't you ask him? I'm sure he'd love to tell you... ^^lol
It's been at least 10+ years, btw. I realized he was a recurring character in around 2010.
I got to chat with him almost everyday (he worked closed to De la Savane). He is actually a nice fellow, he does not try to push anything on you and he is all around wholesome. He really is a true believer in a good way that does not impact us.
This dude is always down to have a really nice conversation with you. He has great discussion skills and isn't about forcing ideology down your throat at all. Dude was there everyday fro. My first year in highschool to my last in college lmao
His devotion was more impressive when he actually held the sign up himself, not just having it on that pole.
I actually know someone who knows him.
The guy has a lot of mental problems related to living on the streets.
And when you don't have anything to believe in, sometimes religion or conspiracies come to fill the void. There's a term for it but I can't recall.
You should just ask him. He's a very nice guy and does not try to push his beliefs. He clearly has some mental issues though.
 Last time I spoke to him, he told me he work as a waiter and comes downtown after work and on his days off. I also asked him why he always wore winter clothes. His answer was that there was a lot of chill air currents in that intersection lol.
A guy with that sign have been standing there since 2001. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the same dude or if they‚Äôre doing rotations.
I spoke with him for \~ 30 minutes once.  We had a pleasant conversation about faith and the history of the world.  He is aligned with the new creationist movement, if I recall correctly.  He works as a server somewhere and has, by all outward appearances, found peace in Christ.  We spoke about Stephen Meyer, author of Darwin's Doubt and other books (I haven't read but am familiar with), and about Christ, evolution, and DNA.  I told him about Ren√© Girard and we parted amicably.  I forget his name, but if he reads this: peace and God bless.
the Bible asks that Christians evangelize and spread the good news of Jesus. Which I assume is what he is doing.
He's the soft of street preacher I can respect, one who speaks only when spoken to. I'm gone with people expressing their religious devotion in ways that aren't noisy.
I've spoken to him a few times. He doesn't *want* anything from you. He is just trying to help people who are suffering with the help of the Bible and Jesus.

Awww I miss that dude! Haven't been downtown in a while. We used to surround him and hang out with him while doing the annual Zombie walks, he was very chill about it, would smile from ear to ear and even would allow pictures with us. 
I am glad he is still doing his thing
He's like the one-armed dude hanging around Guy Concordia metro entrance. You see him every now and then.
He want you to know that Jesus Christ is eternal, pretty obvious, no?
Twerk for Jesus
this is more for him than for you. he wants a reason to get up in the morning, a sense of purpose.
He's earning his Stairway to Heaven
He looks like a Hoth rebellion soldier.
As others have already mentioned, he's a kind fellow. I used to work near De la Savane and would sometimes grab a bite with colleagues where he worked (not sure if he's still there since it's been a few years since then). Had some small talk here and there with him; I definitely recommend having a chat with him if you have the time!
I remember him one time preaching some stuff at the entrance of one of the Heavy MTL from few years ago. I would also see him occasionally in Snowdon metro station.
Attention?
He wants bilingual signage.
I don't get the title and all your comments saying it's "incomprehensible" and whatnot.
Can you read the words...? I think that's all. He's a walking pamphlet for his religion. I'm not catholic either but I don't see what's so confusing about this.
His way of doing his part. In his mind anyhow.
Just look at his upright pose, not slouching.
Whatever he's doing he's proud about it.
Im not sure, I've been alive for 19 years and im pretty sure I've seen him there since I was 5, I kinda wanna talk to him
He's going to talk to you about Jesus.
Used to work on that street, so apparently the church behind him pays him in food/shelter for doing tasks around the church, including this. When Jesus is your gravy train you ride him like Lil Nas X rides the devil
So I've worked with him before. I worked at this coffee shop called LaPrep couple of years back and he was working there full time. During his free time and during the weekends he goes out and stands around Sainte Catherine.
The coffee shop is now closed and I left before it did, so I don't know where he is working now.
He believes it is his life mission to be there and spread the word of his belief.
He is super nice and harmless and seems very passionate about his belief and will most likely gladly tell you what it's all about.
Also some other dude at Angrignon Metro station selling Jesus tee shirts and singing all the time. Quite a character too.
He's picking up Jesus from the airport.  Could someone please tell him he's in the wrong place?

Ces gens de la chapel Good News donc sont quoi ?
You‚Äôre overthinking it. He wants people to be reminded of the message on his sign, for their salvation.
He likely thinks everyone are sinners and that his duty is to save them. It‚Äôs usually something like that.
Persistence personified this guy. He is dialed-in and focused as Forest Gump. It's been a lot more than five years. What is he in it for I wonder? ... that he saves lives?
The approach similar to what we see in this place [https://www.goodnewschapel.org/](https://www.goodnewschapel.org/)
he wants you to open ur heart to Jesus Christ our lord and saviour
I didn't even realize it's always the same guy. I just thought it was someone who worked for the church that's behind him in the photo.
He says Jesus is the only way to Eternal life. So he reminds everyone to remember Jesus who died for our sins.

I talked to him and when I asked him why he was there and if he was representing anti org he just said < no I‚Äôm here to spread the truth because the truth sciences reside in god>. Its been a while since I talked to him so I paraphrased a little bit but yhea that prrety much sum up he‚Äôs deal.

They're also REALLY GOOD. This ads such a nice personal touch though, I love it! I especially laughed at " Owner's words:  
Comparing to our General Tao Chicken, this one is not THAT good.  
Anyway, I am not big fan of North American Chinese food and it's your call. "
&#x200B;
I am hardcore craving some of their food now.
It's interesting how you can see the change in immigration patterns of people from China coming to Montreal/Canada. This city (and Toronto) used to overwhelmingly, if not only, have restaurants specialising in Southern Chinese (Cantonese/Hong Kong) dimsum and other associated dishes. The increase in number of restaurants specialising in Western (Sichuan, Yunnan) and North-Eastern (provinces of Manchuria) cuisine in recent times shows the change towards new Chinese immigrants coming from the industrial rustbelt of China & the *relatively* less well-off Western provinces of China.
It has also seen the (very) gradual diminution of classical "North American/Western Chinese food" (invented largely in North America in the mid-20th c.), in favour of more authentic bites. The commentary in the linked menu plays on that!
*OQLF intensifies*
As a polish person I really felt this in my soul: "Let's salute potato!"
Vermonter here. I miss Montreal so much. If we decide to secede from the US, would you consider taking us in? We'll behave.
"it‚Äôs kind of funny, after a fire destroyed our restaurant at CDN, we opened a new restaurant right in front of a fire station, hope this will give people peace of mind, haha."
This is so wholesome and funny! Craving Chinese food now...
‚ÄúDrink slowly to avoid hiccups‚Äù lol this is great advice
Yeah man, the Orange Beef really needs to get on General Tao's level. It's pretty good but c'mon bruh, be a better you.
Can‚Äôt believe how many times I‚Äôve seen this on Twitter today. Some really cool people have retweeted it, like Samin Nosrat
Honestly, little comments like that is what sometimes make restaurants stand out on my mind
I'll keep this restaurant on my mind!
Cute
Aunt Dai's is a great restaurant, love that place.
It has curry flavour, don't expect it to be SO tasty but it's a safe choice and make you happy.
Wow, I wish all menus had such a charming personal touch!
They have great Szechuan dishes, I‚Äôm glad they reopened after the criminal fire on cote-des-neiges.
I‚Äôm craving some Ming Chuan now but its in brossard :(
\> sadly, only in English
Nice job subtly throwing them under the oqlf bus.
This is the best thing I've read in weeks. Thanks for posting!  It's entertaining and refreshing and now I'm very curious to try this restaurant.
Oh my god! OMG..this used to be my favorite place until it burnt down and I never got the chance to visit the new venue.
I read almost half the page when I stopped to realize how long it was lol. Really funny. Gordon Ramsay would probably yell about the length of the menu.
They‚Äôre one of my fav Chinese haunts. When I moved to Montr√©al, my company put me in the hotel right above/next to aunt dai. 
I found yep of my fav Montr√©al restaurants there  - I am Pho and Aunt Dai.
Thanks for posting this! Got the notification about this post while trying to decide for lunch. Checked their menu and ordered online, came in 20 minutes and now I‚Äôm tucking in! Very nice food indeed!
Je me souviens avoir pass√© de tr√®s bon moments dans ce BYOB sur CDN. Les propri√©taires √©taient  cools !
I always think of beautiful Vermont as part of Quebec. You are all welcome anytime!
Sounds like a great guy! So wholesome lol
This looks so good.  I need to try this place.  Thanks
Their dumplings and satay sauce are insane.
And we got a good laugh out of their online menu when we went.
Most of the dep owners/workers near me come from northern China. One advantage they have over southern immigrants is they aren't too bothered by the winter weather in Quebec because it's just as cold back home. That may be a more important factor than some people realize... I have family from Hong Kong who chose to immigrate to Vancouver over Toronto mainly because they didn't think they could handle an Ontario winter.
There is a lot more education and openness from the whole ‚Äúfoodie‚Äù thing, there a chinese-made doc on netflix which covers regional specialties its pretty informative (bonus : english narration is hypnotic and puts me to sleep fast)
I'm chinese and now when I go to the grocery store, they speak to me in Mandarin (i don't speak) instead of Cantonese (i do)
Le menu est aussi offert en version fran√ßaise, mais il n'y a pas les commentaires du propri√©taire dans cette version.
yea this post will likely get them in trouble sadly. it's a great restaurant
Honest question: Can they do anything about a ‚Äòonline‚Äô menu? I‚Äôd understand if it was on their physical copy but you can do pretty much whatever online, no?
P.S. I do not support the oqlf.

I would rather think that Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine would like to join Canada.
You know we're cousins right? In the 17th we adopted the child survivors of the massacres we committed on your ancestors and then, in the 19th, we mass migrated as cheap labour in the textile factories to escape our extreme rurale poverty! I love Vermont, my favorite state :) I really miss it.
Vermont is cool, I agree. I told my NYC friend we'll take you guys on the northern east side up, I have no control over any of this, but yes. I was planning to visit in April 2020 but uh, yeah, that didn't happen DX still looking forward to it after covid!
If you can get New Hampshire and Maine on board sure
Hell yeh, anything to capture the remainder of the maple syrup industry.

I'll put aside any climate change concerns for a little while, because it's just fucking glorious outside today!
what a year 1872 must've been that it held all those previous records!
2 years ago on this date, we had an ice storm.
I love these posts !

Today and 1945 are such outliers I doubt it can solely be attributed to climate change altho there is surely a part of that too.
It would really be nice to be able to go out and have fun!
I'll have to settle for an after dinner stroll followed by a beer on the porch.
THPPP!
WTF happened in 1945? Legit curious tho, quelqu'un a une explication ?

Climate change
It was a beautiful day today. It felt like June. But worry not, Canada‚Äôs climate is going back on the rag next week and will return to its regular shitty norm.
When did we start measuring temperatures outside?
I swam in a lake in the Laurentians on April 1st once. Also had snow storms. It's weather, it's variable.

1872: L'ANN√âE DE TOUS LES RECORDS
That's not what that means.
I knew something was off.. too good to be true.
It would be wise to not attribute a local temperature at a given time anywhere to climate change, much like you *cannot see statistical representation of events by taking a single event and concluding anything about it*.  
I know it is tempting because we want to practically grasp something that in essence requires us to look at the big picture, but the problem is so complicated that any subject can be discussed for hours. If you really want to grasp just what is occuring in terms of climate change, it's the actual climate change research that requires attention. If you want good pointers to start, I know that it can be painful to find useful and well-researched reports but the IPCC does release good stuff frequently (next big releases by 2022). [Here is an example from IPCC 2017](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-1/) about "what is a 1.5C rise in global temperature on average" and how uneven the consequences are (across time with seasons and cycles, and across space with landmasses and oceans and such). You can see around the point 1.2 ([this image](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/01/Figure-1.3-1024x854.png)) how a rise of a single number is actually very uneven over the world and seasons.  
Another group of insights about "what does the warming mean for our planet" can be found by looking at the executive summary of their chapter 3 also, [checking out this link](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/) and scrolling to chapter 3, clicking on the "Executive summary" is already plenty enough.
If you happen to speak French I could also offer other references too (although I must add that the IPCC truly is the quintessential sourced reference).
Considering how many record temperatures have been broken this year already, you could say that we've had too many 'daily' outliers to not interpret that this year is a trend.
Globally, the seasons are changing. [Warm days are longer and cold days are shorter](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/summers-last-half-year-end-century-rcna436). Of course there are outliers but there is a trend on the global scale.

Living in Toronto really makes you miss the Montreal Metro. So beautiful, clean and convenient.
¬´ Le m√©tro est √† Müíôntr√©al ce que les boulevards sont √† Paris et les canaux √† Venise. ¬ª Jean-Claude Germain, historien
Ahh les bons vieux jours avant la covid!
The shot from the stairs above looking down on the metro made me miss running down the stairs to catch the train when I hear it approaching in the tunnel. What a strange thing to miss, the adrenaline rush of risking my life to run down the stairs before I hear the doo doo doo of the doors.
The metro is great! ^except ^when ^it ^breaks ^down, ^smells ^like ^piss ^and ^has ^weird ^substances ^on ^the ^seats. Other than that, it's great. Easy to use and understand, pretty fast on a good day, relatively clean and almost completely wheelchair accessible(*cough* *cough* Angrignon).
and inaccessible.
It truly is amazing and wonderful.
On the other side of the coin, poor planning led to a nightmare at making it accessible now. Stations are altered or closed for years to accommodate massive building projects to put in... a fucking elevator.
Still, love it.
C'est pour √ßa que je m'√©nerve √† chaque fois que j'entend un Montr√©alais qui est jamais sortis de l'ile qui chiale sur "le pire syst√®me de metro au monde", dude... en dehors du Japon je pense pas que ya grand place sur terre qui on un syst√®me de metro/train aussi bon
When I went to Mexico city and took the subway, something was really weird. I kept telling my friend how much it looked like the one from Montreal. Lo and behold, I see a huge plate on the wall that said built by Bombardier!
Hella selective imagery for their video.  Anyone could have also made a video of what a shit hole our metro system can be too.  They focus a lot on the ceilings and the artwork but totally avoid the shit and piss, the over crowding etc etc.  How about filming ground level a bit more.
Sure, if you get on at angrignon and look at the pretty windows and plants, it looks great.  How about taking a stroll through bonaventure where there's a minimum on 20 people sleeping on the ground...or place des arts where they are smoking crack on the upper floor above the platform.  Rats just wandering around Guy Concordia...
I get it, when you are a superficial tourist, you don't see this stuff and you are so excited to take your shots and fly your drone above the city...but some damned reality would be nice too.
Also...this is about asthetics.  I do understand the utility of the metro, and the sheer number of people that it moves.  I'm just more of an advocate for describing things as they are and I think the city needs to do a lot more to make our metro "beautiful"
Je pense que je vais toujours regretter de pas m'√™tre point√© quelques heures d'avances de plus pour la vente de garage de la stm il y a quelques ann√©es.
Par le temps que je sois arriv√© √† mon tour il restait juste des panneaux square-victoria-oaci  et un ou deux autres qui m'int√©ressait pas. Poop.
Il y avait quelqu'un qui vendait des panneaux neufs sur mesure il y a un bout mais on dirais que la stm a forc√© de fermer la shop parce que j'en trouve pu nulle part.
It's true though , montreal metro is dope asf on it everyday , free the guys
Great system, but I saw literal needles/spoons/lighters discarded on a bench in the metro today. Probably has more to do with the homeless problem in mtl but still a problem that needs to be addressed.
This is awesome! I'm glad to see that I'm not the only person who geeks out on public transit. I'm originally from a city with just a very poor bus system, so despite it being hot and a bit slow sometimes, I can never take the Montreal Metro for granted. I've been here 8 years and love the fact that I don't need a car.
Was that Don McGowan from Travel Travel as the narrator?
Odd in a nice way to see people praise the M√©tro, it is great, but I am just so used to people bitching about it.
from toronto, and while I find the TTC more frequent, The STM is all around a way better system for transportation. It spreads more evenly across the city, and the lines were strategically placed to benefit the majority of the city, unlike toronto where once your out of the core/yonge st., your basically left with a massively scarce bus system. Love my St. Henri to Mt Royal rides <3
I love the Montreal Metro but why this annoying music in the background of the video? I can barely hear what they are saying
It's a great promotional video about montreal subway system.  I used to take the bus and metro every single day between 2003 ans 2019. I miss the people interaction. Metro sounds..
Every time I enter the verdun metro station I feel like im walking in an Ancient Dwarven hall or somthing.
Somthing about the tall ceilings and giant pillars feel so monumental.
Metro is great if you are going where it is going. Once the complete all those expansions and REM lines, we'll actually have an island wide network. That'll be something!
I never realized how good the Metro system was until I rode the NYC subway... dirty, dingy, depressing, ugly, and noisy.
People always bitch about the STM here, but we forget that it's actually a world class system and pretty good compared to a lot of places. The busses in winter suck though, they don't get a pass!
"It's good luck if you touch it"
Ca te rend les doigts tout noirs aussi!
It truly is a masterpiece.
This makes me miss my city! Thanks for posting.
Now if only I didn't have to wait for 3-4 trains to pass by at Laurier to get in every day, then have to squeeze into a 2 foot square pressed up against the door for half the orange line's length. That was back when I needed it to get to work of course... 
I expect I'll be using it a lot less from now on, but so should almost everybody who used to go downtown every day. Hopefully we'll be able to appreciate it more then!

Left to work for 3 years in the US and as someone who despises driving, I was miserable there. It truly made me realize how much I took the public transport in Montreal for granted, and I'm so happy to be back. Bus, metro, train, bixi, underground city. I love Montreal!
I moved here a couple of years ago from a bigger city with a horrible public transport system. Not being able to safely use the metro here in Montreal is one of the worst parts of the past year for me.
Moi j'aime encore plus √ßa maintenant que c'est vide. La chose la plus poche du m√©tro c'est les heures de pointes et en ce moment c'est ben relax.
That's really funny, because living in Montreal I envy the all-encompassing reach of the Toronto system! I guess the grass is always greener on the other metro line, right?
After moving to MTL, the first time I went back to TO, I was amazed at how WIDE the TTC subway cars are O\_o
Same. 
I really don't like the ttc. 
As much as there were issues with the stm, I miss it. 
I think it's time for me to come home if I'm getting emotional over the metro

For perspective, in Boston I was on a train car that *caught on fire* and Park Street station is literally stuck in like 1898 -- you can literally walk across the train tracks because they're on the same level as the floor
Don‚Äôt forget about our wonderful bums and crazy people you see on 7:30 in the morning.
FYI they are currently installing elevators at Angrignon (and Jolicoeur).
Hopefully we continue to right this wrong over the next few years
dans quel sens? le prix?
Flips me out. Frontenac has (had ?) a leak that's been there over 5 years - they just put barriers across the puddle if it gets too big. Berri has been building an elevator since what, 9-10 years now ? C√¥te-des-Neiges has had stone paneling next to a hole in the wall for at least 5 months (moved here recently).
It's nice that the stations have unique designs, some of them quite beautiful, but the stations are not very well taken care of.

It's an issue that appears when shooting with a long exposure and high ISO without removing the noise in post. Most cameras have an option to reduce noise for these types of pictures. Lightroom and fancy AI denoisers can handle it in post.

Sometimes imperfection brings us closer to perfection.  At the end of the day, if the grain or noise adds some kind of dimension for discussion or otherwise, who am I to say that the 340 people who've upvoted this image have bad taste?  On the other hand there are millions of people who like Nickelback so the masses don't always get it right. As far as photo and film goes though, my own personal preferences lean toward less polished stuff. If some kid took this and didn't completely know what they're doing, that makes it more interesting to me.
Sorry not a professional just a hubby, anytime you going let me so I can come so you can give me some points on taken better shots
Yes
You are right. I'm sorry. I jumped down some stranger's throat unnecessarily because I had a bad day. I didn't contribute anything of value with my comment. I'll try to do better in the future
You‚Äôre ten times better than most people on the internet by virtue of your civility. No worries. We all have bad days.

Love these updates
The trees outside my apartment are budding. Is it even possible for there to be leaf on trees come early April?
On the chart you can see the effects of climate change
I genuinely love you posts man, thanks!
KNEW IT! This weather was very sus.
Too muddy to really enjoy it. It's called "saison de la bouette"
Quelle belle journ√©e!!
sigh!
Im new to St Henri, can anyone tell me how bad a second floor apartment will be without air con?
Montreal weather is no longer natty.
jpense pas qu‚Äôun m√©daille c‚Äôest la meilleure mani√®re de repr√©senter le r√©chauffement climatique mais ok
Started up my grill for the first time in 2021 today. Italian sausage in a bun with roasted peppers. If it wasn't a sign of the end times, I'd love to have short winters like this all the time.
But the graph says that 1979 is 2nd....
Montreal weather can't decide on one temperature, bipolar asf
We're fucked
Mo√© j'porte mes shorts!
Was in Sutton today, it was a weird sight to have people dressed in ski suits and people in shorts at the convenience store.
No.  It has never hit 40¬∞C in Montreal.  It has never even hit 38¬∞C.  I don't think we'll get there this year either.
Can you imagine the humidity. uhg
We don't tolerate this kind of negativity round'ere
Used to be there was a snowstorm in May. We weren't done till third week of May
MichaelScott\_NooooooooooNoNoNoNOOOOO.gif
Chances are still high around the 3rd to the 8th of April.
Models are leaning toward this and oscillations too.
Like..
Thanks for the few minutes when I was outside today but no thanks for the dark future coming:(
Jinx nous dont pas
Je ne te dirais pas alors ce qui risque de ce passer pour P√¢ques avec les mod√®les Canadien et Am√©ricain ave 12" de neige pour Montr√©al.

J'suis pas un expert mais je pense que la dilatation du mercure en fonction de la temp√©rature est lin√©aire faque si tu pouvais faire des graduations pr√©cises, ce qui me semble pas compliqu√©, la lecture de la temp√©rature devait √™tre pas mal pr√©cise aussi.
Ils en utilisent deux et faisaient une moyenne, donc c'est correct.
Thermometers have been accurate for a long time:
[https://lab-robotics.org/health-and-medical/medical-history-how-accurate-were-thermometers-100-years-ago/](https://lab-robotics.org/health-and-medical/medical-history-how-accurate-were-thermometers-100-years-ago/)
While it's a fun factoid, looking at the temperature of one very specific day (March 23rd) across the years seems a little weird. Maybe more relevant would be to look at the highest temperature in the given month across the years? Like the highest temperature in March across all years.
For example, it could be that March 22nd and 24th 2019 were actually both warmer, but this graphic makes it look like the last warm year was 2012.
This is actually a big problem to have a really hot day early spring like that. If it freeze for too long after it will damage trees and affect fruit harvest like apples.
correct me if im wrong but i thought budding was du to increase sunlight and not necessarily the heat?
Thank you.  It's a lot of work, but it's nice to hear this.
Say that to people in Parc La Fontaine, Jarry, Sir George Etienne Cartier, le Canal, etc etc etc.
devastating tbh
You need AC in Montr√©al pretty much.
2nd floor in St-Henri here: Good luck.
If you have decent insulation you can get a cheap $150 Toshiba window unit at the Home Depot. No, it won't supercool your home, but will make it livable.
How much HDR do you have
\- Yes...
A tad overdone with HDR (handrails are glowing) but otherwise a great shot
Nice composition, cool it a bit with the HDR though.

Est-ce que √ßa fait r√©ellement une diff√©rence de reculer l‚Äôheure du fucking couvre-feu?
FUCK FRANCOIS LEGAULT
What difference does an hour and a half actually make? I'm genuinely upset about this, the weather is beautiful and is really going to make this difficult.
I wonder if they ever look at their own [Gouvernement du Qu√©bec](https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/situation-coronavirus-in-quebec#c70108) data site. Scroll down to ‚ÄúActive and completed outbreaks by environment‚Äù. That graph has consistently shown that the number one place of outbreaks is workplace environments, followed by schools, both by a huge margin compared to other causes, and yet as soon as numbers drop in the slightest, it‚Äôs open up the schools, and put all the store workers and others at risk in indoor environments. Ass-backwards half-measures not based on science or common sense, only political theatre.
I could be fine with the curfew IF he showed the cost/benefit model they are using to justify it.  Exactly how many lives are we predicted to save?  Were over 1 year into the pandemic, stop pretending like this is difficult.  Every university with an MBA program does this exercise multiple times.
Peut-√™tre que ce serait bien de prouver l‚Äôefficacit√© du couvre-feu avant de le rendre encore plus restrictif. Pour un gouvernement qui pr√©tend ¬´¬†√©couter la science¬†¬ª √ßa fait dur en criss.
J‚Äôai le sentiment qu‚Äôon ‚Äúpunit‚Äù Montr√©al pour que les autres villes acceptent leurs mesures... je suis sur le cul.
I am really shocked that this change has been made instead of removing the curfew. This fucking crazy change will encourage people to gather inside instead of outside in the summer. You absolutely can‚Äôt prevent people from gathering together after one year of isolation. All of us are tired and depressed. I can‚Äôt believe that I‚Äôd not be able to walk at 8 pm but schools are still open. What difference do an hour and a half make?
Je commen√ßais √† me sentir un peu mieux apr√®s l‚Äôarriv√©e du beau temps, j‚Äôadore aller prendre des marches le soir... je vais devoir oublier √ßa on dirait. JE SUIS PU CAPABLE D‚Äô√äTRE DANS MON 3 1/2 fuck ce couvre-feu qui aide fuck all
This is a great reward for our 6 months straight of lockdown and keeping our cases under control since the end of January.
Ya, I'm done with this shit. I've followed all the rules and haven't seen friends or family in over a year. But this is my red line. No benefit, no science, no logic, nothing. This guy is a real fucking piece of shit.
What are we going to do?
I'm so fucking done with this government. Their decisions are *not* based on medical evidence and we are all paying the price for it.  
A government should not be allowed to impose an arbitrary, open ended curfew with no telling when it will end. It's too much of an invasion of civil liberties, and there isn't even strong evidence that curfew works. 
If you want to get it under control, circuit break for a month and close the schools, don't make us wear masks in goddamn *parks*.
To hell with this clown!  Show us the fucking science that proves this substantially cuts cases before you deprive us of our most fundamental civil liberties.  The last 8pm curfew coincided with a drop, not only here, but in a large number of countries that didn't have a curfew.  That's easily illustrated.  Why are we so quick to let them use this "tool" to purportedly stem COVID?  They all live in big fucking houses with yards and space.  They don't understand. Fuck them.  Fuck them all.
You want people to be outside as much as possible. I dont understand this at all
It‚Äôs been a year. There‚Äôs no plan or foresight. There never was. Many people are not going to listen now that the sun is out and things will only get worse and more tense
OK s√©rieux, c'est le temps de faire quelque chose. Si la population ne s'exprime pas, √ßa va s'√©tirer encore des mois.
I want to sign a petition against this fucking horseshit!
Si Val√©rie Plante annonce qu'elle ordonne au SPVM de ne pas appliquer le couvre-feu √† 20 heures, tout est pardonn√©, elle a mon vote aux prochaines √©lections.
Well fuck me then, this is draconian and the 9:30 was barely a fucking bone, after a year of this idk exactly how I'm supposed to find the will to live if they're so willing to make this ongoing. 
Like sorta joking but also not fully, if I just ignore the curfew and get tickets and then contest them, can I argue that this is against my civil liberties? What if a few thousand people did that? No? Nothing? I should schedule my next panic attack since that's something that's started happening since the pandemic? Cool
Ma seule consolation dans tout ca c'est esperer que la CAQ fasse assez chier le monde pour perdre les prochaines √©lections 
plz
J'ai envoy√© un courriel √† ma d√©put√©e, mais je doute vraiment qu'il aie un effet. Je ne sais plus quoi faire, √ßa me rende d√©vast√©. Soyez fort mes amies.
Legault has nothing to lose here. Punishing Montreal is popular with his base, and they won a single riding in the Montreal area.
It's win/win for him since he wasn't winning over new voters here so he may as well punish us to shore up support elsewhere.
Tabarnak
This fucking buffoon should be removed from power
Wow, on change le couvre feu comme "pr√©caution", mais les √©coles restent ouverts? At least there is evidence that closing schools really affects the spread!
So Quebec City fucks up with the gym and we get fucked for it?!
Le pire c'est que √ßa changera rien. Les gens qui ne respectent pas les consignes, ne le feront pas plus.
J'habite seule, je prom√®ne mon chien quelques fois par jours (youppi t√©l√©travail). √áa me fait sortir de mon 3 1/2. Je peux vous dire qu'il y a beaucoup de traffic vers 21-21h30 de tout ceux qui se d√©p√™che vite vite de rentrer chez eux. Je me prive de voir des gens. Je n'ai pas vue ma m√®re, ni ma soeur depuis presqu'un an. J'ai le droit d'inviter 1 personne, toujours la m√™me, chez moi. J'ai d√ª choisir parmis mes ami(e)s lequel, c'est difficile.
Pendant ce temps, mes voisins de duplex, en couple/famille continue de faire des rassemblements avec des amis bien cach√© dans leur cour arri√®re, sans cons√©quences. 
C'est difficile et je suis vraiment tann√©e.
La seule chose que son couvre-feu fait, c‚Äôest faire en sorte que tout le monde se presse a 6h30-7h pour aller a la pharmacie/√©picerie faire ses courses
Alors moi, le petit commis qui passe toute sa journ√©e dans sa chambre a faire ses cours d‚Äôuni sur zoom doit voir plus de clients durant son shift, et donc √™tre encore plus expos√© au virus. 
Et la seule chose qui me restait.. soit faire une petite marche ou aller au gym n‚Äôest plus disponible 
Je suis pour les masques et la distanciation sociale.. mais l√† jsp je trouve c‚Äôest lourd..
Wow. Just. Wow. 
Once again the younger population is paying the price for this administration's sheer incompetence.
Weather is nice again. Can we just have some f***ing peace??
j'ai envie d'ecrire toute la haine du monde a ce monsieur qui g√©re cette pand√©mie sans data, et sans aucune vision. 
Merci de massacrer notre sant√© mentale.
Time for massive public disobedience folks! Fuck these old idiots, they‚Äôre just covering their asses, they don‚Äôt care to make things better at all.
Les plus grands foyers d‚Äô√©closion sont au travail, la garderie et les √©coles. L‚Äôheure du couvre-feu n‚Äôa AUCUN impact sur √ßa.
Someone I knew took his life today. The guy was in his thirties, had a good career, nice family and friends. He was kind, open minded and with big heart.
He's been battling with some mental issues that his family was aware of. However, things got a lot worse during the lockdown and especially curfew which he respected. 
Many friends claim that today's news of extended curfew for no apparent reason was that last push. For someone who's been in need of social connection, yet who respected all Legaults baseless measures - there was a limit. 
This pains me deeply and I wish he  would have reached out to his friends or to professional before taking his young life away. Maybe he tried, but no one could come see him because it was after couvre-feu. It was a huge wake up call for me and many others who knew him. 
Rest in peace D. 
You will be missed üòû
Oh fuck off
Avec la menace du beau temps qui revient, une chance que cet excellent gouvernement est l√† pour nous emp√™cher d'avoir le moindre r√©pit apr√®s des mois d'enfermement, de carence et d'isolation.
Merci, c'est tellement appr√©ci√©.
This is really upsetting. My thoughts are going to be drifting to very dark places like the first time around. I‚Äôve been doing better since the 8pm curfew ended. I relapsed hard last Thursday. I debated the value of my life the first time around. I hope I‚Äôll still have the strength to keep fighting but I‚Äôm just not sure it‚Äôs worth fighting anymore if every fight is a loss. They‚Äôve beaten me down and I‚Äôve lost faith in democracy and  life in general. If we won‚Äôt fight for what‚Äôs right I‚Äôm not sure I have any gas left. At least had this been a war there is something worth fighting for. This is just crap. I can‚Äôt even die a hero like the good soldier I‚Äôve been. The curfew has direct impact on my desire to live. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore :(
This is a democracy.  These are unprecedented times.  Can we please hold a vote of no confidence and get someone else at the helm?
C'est pas vraiment une surprise mais ostie que c'est tannant d'√™tre gouvern√© par des incomp√©tents. Personnellement j'envisage tr√®s s√©rieusement de bouger ailleurs, quitte √† me taper 2 semaines d'enfermement √† l'h√¥tel. C'est plus possible icitte.
What can we do to voice our opinion against this? Like, what's the best channel or approach?
Been dutiful and compliant this whole time. And even I think this is too much. I'm willing to do something to show that I don't agree, but I'm not sure how to go about it effectively. 
Angry posting on social media ain't enough.
Our basic civil liberties are being suspended on an old man's hunch.
Esti que je suis content de voir que je suis pas le seul qui trouve que de retourner au couvre feu √† 20h est cave. En plus vous exprimez bien les arguments sans virer dans des propos complotistes.
wtf does a curfew even do?
R√©√©tablir le couvre feu √† 20h si facilement est le produit du dangereux pr√©c√©dent que nous avons accept√© en le permettant initialement.
√áa devrait √™tre une mesure d'urgence, et encore. **Aujourd'hui, on l'utilise de mani√®re pr√©ventive.**

I want to ask an honest question here: is this legal? Is it written in our legal code that the government can do this? Moreover, does anyone know if people are legally bound to pay the fines given for being out past curfew? You'd think, well yes, but is it really this straightforward? I know we have an incredibly docile population that doesn't like to fight back but are we really just going to take this?
√áa m‚Äôa l‚Äôair assez raisonnable comme choix de OS. Je suis un die hard de Linux pour le embedded mais avec les cartes NFC je pense que le support commercial est meilleur avec Windows.
Quand les gens voient 2013 et qu‚Äôils pensent que c‚Äôest vieux.. Le dernier Windows Server (dernier cri) est : Windows Server 2019 sur lequel Windows 10 est bas√©. Au final c‚Äôest juste des chiffres et la date montre le moment o√π ils ont gel√© le d√©veloppement pour le distribuer au public..
En plus pour Windows embedded, c‚Äôest d√©sirable d‚Äôavoir un long cycle de support car le d√©veloppement pour ces plateformes hautement sp√©cialis√©s est tr√®s co√ªteux.
Sans dire que les outils pour travailler avec les cartes OPUS ont √©t√© d√©velopp√©s pour Windows alors cette plateforme permet des √©conomies en r√©utilisant les librairies d√©j√† d√©velopp√©s.
Je dois noter une seule chose : j‚Äôaurais redirig√© la sortie vid√©o et rien afficher a moins que le terminal soit actif. C‚Äôest un peu paresseux de juste utiliser le gestionnaire de fen√™tres Windows pour √ßa mais bon, question d‚Äôapparence.
The STM is so behind on two basic concepts:
- boarding from both doors on the bus
- loading your opus card with tickets using NFC on your phone
And it pains me to see them be all "we're so modern and with the times üòä" when they choose to implement a system that will not be supported 3 years from now.
(Edited for formatting)
For anyone looking for something bad about this. This is the most recent version of the software.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Embedded_Compact
As someone who took AMT trains and would see the display acreens errored out with windows XP, nothing shocks me
The original rollout of the opus system was so long that the technology was already outdated when implented. That's what huge bureaucracy overhead will do to any organization.
Mon Dreamcast utilise aussi Windows CE.
It's only a matter of time now before somebody is hacking one of these and playing Doom on it
Not that I have anything against these readers but what's the point of these? Most busses that I've been on with these working still don't open the back doors to let people in. I feel like I'm definitely missing something.
ts√©, c'est NORMAL.  
Les achats et le d√©veloppement logiciel/mat√©riel se font sur les donn√©es au moment des analyses techniques; pas parce qu'il y a une nouvelle version qu'ils vont tout changer √† quelques semaines/mois de la livraison.  
Genre (pas STM reli√©),   
Je suis dans une business avec un tr√®s long cycle, on a des clients avec des tr√®s vieilles versions de nos logiciels, on leurs fournis des versions r√©centes, mais √ßa va prendre **plusieurs** mois (12-18 mois au plus rapide) avant que √ßa va √™tre mis en service.
I guess nowadays we‚Äôd use Windows 10 IoT for embedded purposes?
Ah yes, windows CE - kinda ancient though
Quand le lecteur de carte est sus üò≥
This is OLD stuff, oudated already been replaced by Windows IOT ... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows\_IoT
When am i gonna be just able to use the nfc on my phone instead of carrying a card everywere its 2021 come on
STM keeps raising prices. Can we get the latest tech?
Mouhaha!! Windows... c'est certain que √ßa va crahser.... tant que c'est les autobus qui crashent....
What would be really nice is to do away with the mandatory Opus card cash grab and allow paypass or similar payment methods.
This isn't even fully rolled out and it's already outdated. Less us put our fare on our Apple Pay and Google Wallets please.
Oooh did you hit "command" ?
/r/bluescreenofdeath/
They should use Linux to avoid these errors
La STM veut nous √©pater avec de la technologie ~~du futur~~ de la d√©cennie pass√©e.
Hmm, je vais devoir √™tre en d√©saccord.
Le travail d'une borne de v√©rification est tr√®s simple. Elle doit communiquer avec la carte, et v√©rifier le titre pr√©sent, ainsi que les 3 derniers endroits ou la carte a √©t√© utilis√©e.
Des outils open-source pour faire cela sont d√©j√† disponibles : https://github.com/etiennedub/LecteurOPUS
Ensuite, le lecteur doit envoyer un message tr√®s simple aux serveurs de la STM avec l'heure du passage et le num√©ro de carte.
Finalement, il faut communiquer √† la carte qu'elle vient de se faire scanner (facile si on a acc√®s au cl√©s de la STM), et faire rouler un peu de business logic pour d√©cider si le titre est valide.
Ceci n'est pas sp√©cialis√©, ni couteux. C'est tr√®s standard dans le milieu. 
Il n'y a pas non plus de meilleur support commercial avec Windows CE 2013. Windows CE 2013 est en fin de support d'ici trois ans. Le cycle de support est tr√®s court.
Il n'y a m√™me pas vraiment d'√©conomies - √† la rigueur les librairies d√©j√† developp√©es vont √™tre soit compillables pour Linux, ou op√©rationelles via WINE, pour tr√®s, tr√®s peu d'argent. Mais les libraries ne seront pas compatibles d'augure - il faudra les porter de x86 √† ARM ou payer 5x plus pour des syst√®mes embarqu√©s x86. M√™me a cela Windows CE a un noyau diff√©rent et donc pas mal de logiciels m√™me sur x86 ne fonctionnent tout simplement pas sur Windows CE.
En comparaison, du c√¥t√© Linux, le mat√©riel pour : communiquer en NFC avec la carte, afficher sur un √©cran, communiquer avec les serveurs de la STM co√ªterait environ 5$. 
Au final, aller avec une plateforme Windows CE c'est : plus cher en mat√©riel , offre beaucoup moins de flexibilit√© √† tous les niveaux, co√ªte en license, support√© pour seulement 3 ans (le Mainstream Support Cycle est d√©j√† termin√©), et est presque aussi alien √† Windows NT x86 que Linux. 
En r√©sum√©, comme dans 99.9999% des cas, Windows CE √©tait un Bad Move, probablement parce que quiconque a d√©croch√© le contrat avait plus d'exp√©rience avec et a calcul√© que √ßa augmente les chances que la STM n'aille pas regarder ailleurs. Mais c'est ce qui se passe quand le gouvernement ne fait pas ses TI in-house.
Les sources post√©es plus bas mentionnent que le support se termine en 2023, n'est-ce donc pas un os en fin de vie tout de m√™me ?
Est ce que Windows 10 iot est suppos√© √™tre la nouvelle g√©n√©ration de syst√®mes embarqu√©s ?
√áa me para√Æt overkill pour une simple machine qui n'a besoin de savoir faire que deux ou trois trucs...
Bien dit.
Die Hard 2: ~~Die Harder~~ Die Plus Hard
oh do these new readers *not* use NFC with phones yet? I thought that was here.
All things the same, as a native NYC bloke, STM reloadable cards were centuries ahead of stripe readers from MTA metro cards. But, they've gradually rolled out NFC support over the years and its so convenient.
What an idiotic comment. These new readers are being installed SPECIFICALLY to allow rear-door boarding and NFC payments.
http://www.stm.info/fr/a-propos/grands-projets/grands-projets-bus/nouveaux-valideurs-dans-les-bus
is loading from both doors actually more efficient when people also need to get off the bus? For sure I can see the benefits when no one is getting off the bus at terminus stops, but anywhere else, I feel like this could cause more problems than it solves when people try boarding and exiting simultaneously.
OPUS card data is actually not uploaded in real time. When you buy/use a fare (at least on buses), it is reflected on your card immediately, but it is not uploaded to STM until the end of the day. This is why, for [registered cards](http://www.stm.info/en/info/fares/opus-cards-and-other-fare-media/registered-opus-card),
> If you loaded your OPUS card with fares today, you must wait until tomorrow to exchange your card and recover its remaining balance of valid fares.
The card itself is actually readable (look it up on Google Play). So it's theoretically possible to hack the card during the time difference. OPUS en ligne forces a certain implementation, NFC is too open, so no NFC.
All the same, Microsoft has phased out support of this OS.
And the most egregious part was that they were just using it to run Chrome in full screen. A raspberry Pi could do that.
The initial rollout was quite fast. Sure, the technology has become outdated in the 10+ years since then, but in 2008 it was not outdated.
>what's the point of these?
They'll allow rear-door validation in articulated buses, and, in the second phase of the rollout, in 2022 or 2023, other payment options ‚Äî like credit cards, debit cards and mobile payments will be accepted.
https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/stm-has-new-card-readers-but-it-will-be-years-before-theyre-up-to-speed
It feels so overkill to have a whole OS for such a basic functionality as card reading.
Content de voir que j'√©tais pas le seul qui trouve que √ßa ressemble √† amogus ha ha
>Since June 2018, the ability to process bank cards (both physically or in smart phones) has been integrated into all acquisitions of new fare validation equipment. By the time a new payment solution is implemented, all fare validation equipment will have been changed.

I agree this would be niet but this also reminds a corner case. The vast majority of the users are just fine with a card. I understand the STM focus on something else.
The price hikes are to pay for the bureaucracy that prevents you from getting the latest tech.
These new terminals are being installed specifically to enable this.
How are these outdated? What will they not be able to support?
how is outdated? it‚Äôs an opus card reader that will accept card payments as well, mobile support has nothing to do with the machine itself.
Windows is stable, most of the time the crash are either coming from the hardware (over heating CPU, bad memory, etc) or the drivers. And I'm a Linux user since before 2000 üòÅ.

Je suis d'accord avec toi mais tu pense comme un dev et non comme un manager. C'est beaucoup moins cher r√©utiliser du code existant et des technologies existantes. Ceux qui font ce genre de d√©cisions ne pense pas au co√ªt au long terme. Seulement le co√ªt imm√©diat.

They are compatible with NFC at the physical level, but with no support for the protocol. It would mostly be a question of software.
You can read the cards from a phone and see where it was used last and which titles are on it. But reloading them using your phone is not supported because the STM hasn't put the software out there.
Dimanche ?

A few buddies of mine the other day decided to go to Alfy's Pizza and Wings out in the west. For some of us, it was our first time there and we were clearly enamored by the sight of spicy wings. So we gave in to our temptation and got the wings, hoping to find a bench or something and eat our food. 
What followed was 30 mins of endlessly waiting and watching gusts of torrential rain impede us from peacefully eating our spicy juicy wings. Once we got our food we walked out onto the curb and disgracefully squatted down into a circle and devour the wings under the rain. With our hands messy to the wrist with sauce, we became primitive cavemen, eviscerating the poulet from the bone. Finally, our lips were burning and we were shedding sauce, sweat, and tears from our eyelids. And then I looked up and saw the same rainbow. Thanks for reading.
Gorgeous.

I went yesterday and adored it! this is the girl who got a spicy chicken wing stolen by a squirrel who likely has indigestion today
amazing show we had a blast ‚ù§Ô∏è cant wait for next one
Should've said at 7 and then oh sorry I meant at 8
Is this legal? Do you have official permission from the borough? Do the cops ever come and break it up? I ask because there are these DJ shows that have also been cropping up saturday nights in various parks, but invariably some dumbass cops show up to kill it. What's the difference between DJ set and comedy show?
There was a French show a couple weeks ago in Parc LaFontaine. 
There's also a show that occasionally pops up Jeane-Mance.  
Can't recall if that:s English or French though.
I guess you just have to either luck out or be in the know, they're not often advertised.
There's plenty of French park shows, just not this one. Checkout Picnic et Humour on Facebook.
English unfortunately
Yeah! Corner of Girouard and Chemin de la Cote-saints-antoinne
Thats amazing. I live super close by, is there a website or anywhere we can see planned events?
I post about it on thrive NDG on Facebook
Hell yeah!
I don't talk to the police
Thank you!
Super glad you had fun also happy for that squirrel
These shows start at ~8 and end before 10, idk about the DJ sets but I presume they go on for longer.
Yeah, it‚Äôs a shame NDG doesn‚Äôt have more French events since the neighborhood is now 50-50 when it comes to language
Did Claude Crest used to do english comedy? Would be magic.
Cool
Sorry, I'm not aware if there's any website. I went for a walk and stumble upon that concert. Enjoyed it pretty much.

I think it's my friend Elspeth putting that on, eh?
I wanted to go but I am out of town. How was it?
Thanks! Just found that one too. This is all great, just moved here and itll help to have this and other groups
Great show you the host?

Confirmed
Si vous avez √©cout√© Legault hier, ce n'est m√™me pas ce qu'il a dit en fran√ßais. Il a dit que le f√©d√©ral ne leur avait pas communiqu√© s'ils perdraient les doses de Pfizer s'ils ne se tenaient pas au cadre des deux doses en trois semaines.
Voici la citation d'hier:
>¬´ Est-ce qu‚Äôil y a un risque r√©el qu‚Äôune compagnie comme Pfizer cesse de livrer des doses parce qu‚Äôon ne respecte pas le d√©lai entre les deux doses ? √âvidemment, on va se conformer si c‚Äôest pour arr√™ter l‚Äôapprovisionnement des nouvelles doses, a indiqu√© M. Legault lundi. Mais, si on a le choix ‚Äî et on souhaite que ce soit le gouvernement du Qu√©bec qui fasse ce choix-l√† ‚Äî, on pr√©f√®re vacciner plus de personnes. ¬ª
Notez la diff√©rence flagrante et importante avec ce que contient l'article:
>"What the federal government has told us... is whether there's a real risk that a company like Pfizer might stop delivering doses because we're not respecting the \[interval\] between the two doses," said Legault.  
>  
>"There, of course, we would comply, if it would lead to stopping procurement of the second dose," he said.
Avec comme titre "**Pfizer could withdraw vaccine supply from Quebec if two-dose schedule not followed: Legault**"?
C'est pourquoi on ne trouve pas ce titre farfelus dans les m√©dias francophones (ou tous les autre m√©dias sauf IheartRadio et CTV Montreal), pourtant, ils parlent de la m√™me conf√©rence de presse.

Vous tombez carr√©ment pour de la propagande.
On se plaint beaucoup du couvre-feu et des mesures sanitaires mais je ne comprend pas qu'on ne soit pas plus outr√© par ces d√©cisions l√† de Legault et son gouvernement. Il n'y a pas d'√©tude qui montre que le vaccin est vraiment efficace si on attend des mois pour la deuxi√®me doses. Je comprend qu'ils veulent vacciner un maximum de personnes, mais si au final on le fait tout croche et √ßa ne marche pas, on sera pas plus avanc√© et √ßa aura co√ªt√© une fortune et plusieurs vies. Qu'ils respectent les consignes du fabricant comme n'importe quel m√©dicaments. Cest pas √† des politiciens de d√©cider comment fonctionne le vaccin et on ne devrait pas laisser passer √ßa non plus. On s'en fout du couvre-feu, Legault fait n'importe quoi avec les vaccins et √ßa c'est probl√©matique.
Imagine telling your population that the virus is out of control because they‚Äôre not following directives only to turn around and not follow the directives of the vaccine producers in administering the vaccine they designed in record time that would get us out of this mess....
Does the CAQ have a PR team? Because they really need one.
[deleted]
> A Pfizer spokesperson said the company "cannot confirm that such consequences have been implied," but that "Pfizer has continued to encourage public health authorities across Canada to follow the Health Canada authorized dosing intervals." 
Pure sp√©culation jusqu'√† maintenant, rien n'a √©t√© dit que √ßa arriverait, la question est juste pos√©e.
What a bunch of pieces of shit. Meanwhile they're enacting this curfew to shield their own incompetence. I have no trust in the people
So we must follow the lockdown rules or risk severe fines. For the record I'm all for following the protocol. Where I can see how it would get lost on some is the fact Legault isn't listening to the Pharma company issuing the vaccine and their recommended dose. He's the type of guy who's doctor says take these pill for the full 10days but stops after day 3 because he feels better. This is not going to go well if he continues the way he is.
It‚Äôll be travesty if this joker gets another term
This government sure isn't used to being told 'no'. Would be nice to see them finally **not** get away with one of their idiotic decisions.
Going against the manufacturer's recommendations is not only dangerous, it undermines the public's trust in vaccines. These are not "suggestions", these are recommendations based on the data they have.
> BioNTech and partner Pfizer warned on Monday that they had no evidence that their jointly developed vaccine will continue to protect against Covid-19 if the booster shot is given later than tested in trials.
> ‚ÄúThe safety and efficacy of the vaccine has not been evaluated on different dosing schedules as the majority of trial participants received the second dose within the window specified in the study design,‚Äù the companies said in a joint statement, referring to prime and a booster shots given three weeks apart.
> ‚ÄúThere is no data to demonstrate that protection after the first dose is sustained after 21 days.‚Äù
https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/04/biontech-says-no-data-to-support-delayed-vaccine-booster-shot-offers-covid-protection.html
Statement from the FDA 
> However, at this time, suggesting changes to the FDA-authorized dosing or schedules of these vaccines is premature and not rooted solidly in the available evidence. Without appropriate data supporting such changes in vaccine administration, we run a significant risk of placing public health at risk, undermining the historic vaccination efforts to protect the population from COVID-19.
> What we have seen is that the data in the firms‚Äô submissions regarding the first dose is commonly being misinterpreted. In the phase 3 trials, 98% of participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech trial and 92% of participants in the Moderna trial received two doses of the vaccine at either a three- or four-week interval, respectively. Those participants who did not receive two vaccine doses at either a three-or four-week interval were generally only followed for a short period of time, such that we cannot conclude anything definitive about the depth or duration of protection after a single dose of vaccine from the single dose percentages reported by the companies.  
> We know that some of these discussions about changing the dosing schedule or dose are based on a belief that changing the dose or dosing schedule can help get more vaccine to the public faster. **However, making such changes that are not supported by adequate scientific evidence may ultimately be counterproductive to public health.**
https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-statement-following-authorized-dosing-schedules-covid-19-vaccines
We are governed by morons
Isn‚Äôt it the federal that buys and distribute the vaccine though?
This article is a bit misleading. It seems to imply Pfizer would withdraw the vaccine supply when in fact its the Quebec government asking if they would if they do not follow the dose timing. Pfizer has responded that they recommend government follow their instructions as beat they can but they will not withdraw supply.
Legault is just taking orders from the [real experts](https://media2.giphy.com/media/3orifhNhn840GpMMPm/giphy.gif).
√áa fait peur, les cons√©quences pourraient √™tre la mutation du virus.
https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/04/britain-takes-a-gamble-with-covid-19-vaccines-upping-the-stakes-for-the-rest-of-us/
Would Pfizer still be liable if something were to go wrong if the government isn‚Äôt following the schedule?
Everyday there's a new joke with Legault being the protagonist.
Isn‚Äôt the US government about to go the same thing once Biden takes office?
Beaucoup d'information circule et c'est important de faire le tri. Voici ce qu'on sait gr√¢ce aux donn√©es de Pfizer.
- Si on donne une seule dose, l'immunit√© au bout de 21 jours est de 92%. L'intervalle de confiance est encore un d√©bat tho, notamment pour les personnes avec un syst√®me immunitaire faible.
- La problematique de Pfizer √©tait d'obtenir la meilleur couverture virale le plus vite possible. Espacer la premi√®re dose et le rappel augmente la couverture virale! Seulement, vu la pand√©mie, il a √©t√© jug√© qu'il valait mieux avoir 97% d'immunit√© avec 21 jours d'intervalle que 98% en 30+ jours.
- Espacer les doses jusqu'√† 12 semaines augmente la couverture virale (de 1 √† 2%). La probl√©matique est, que se passe-t-il si on d√©passe ce d√©lai? Personne ne le sait, on a aucune donn√©es l√† dessus et tr√®s peu de vaccins MRNA similaire pour les humains (quelques rares exemples pour certains cancer). C'est assez dur de g√©n√©raliser.
- Beaucoup de personnes vaccin√©s au Qu√©bec ont sign√© une d√©charge d'acception du vaccin qui stipule clairement 2 doses espac√©s de 21 jours. Le non respect de cette close est une violation directe de l'accord, on s'entend que beaucoup de personnes doutent du vaccin et que les d√©cisions de Legault renforcent encore plus ce sentiment. Comment faire confiance au gouvernement s'il n'honore m√™me pas ses contrats?
- La lente vaccination au Qu√©bec est d√ª au manque d'approvisionnement. Beaucoup de personnel m√©dical peut √™tre r√©quisitionn√© pour vacciner, j'ai vu des orthophonistes recevoir des formations pour venir en aide √† la campagne de vaccination. On a le "man power" de vacciner beaucoup de monde, et on a la logistique gr√¢ce aux cliniques de tests PCR. Il nous faut juste des doses.
Informations √† prendre avec un grain de sel, c'est l'information qui circule dans le r√©seau de la sant√©.
For the record, mon grief avec le couvre-feu c'est beaucoup que la CAQ l'utilise comme diversion, tel un magicien de centre d'achat, pendant qu'ils font des affaires fucking douteuses. Je m'oppose au couvre-feu feu comme mesure sanitaire, parce que seul il n'a aucun fondement scientifique (on pourrait en discuter si on √©tait r√©ellement en confinement), mais ce qui est vraiment choquant c'est comment il est utilis√© comme strat√©gie pour gaslight et diviser la population.
√áa marche extr√™mement bien parce que depuis le d√©but de la crise, on est f√¢ch√©s contre les r√©calcitrants, alors la CAQ nous sort une mesure insens√©e qui nous force √† dire "Je suis pas complotiste, mais..." pour la critiquer.
M√™me Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois s'est fait traiter de complotiste par la CAQ pour oser en demander le fondement scientifique. 
Je suis inqui√®te pour les vaccins, parce qu'on s'en va vers une utilisation qui a pas √©t√© test√©e. La logique voudrait que le booster fonctionne encore apr√®s une attente un peu plus longue, mais on n'a litt√©ralement aucune donn√©e sur le sujet. C'est en continuit√© avec le manque de prudence dont on a fait preuve depuis le d√©but. Si on a raison pour les vaccins, c'est un pari qui va rapporter. Mais si on se trompe, encore, on n'a pas fini de gal√®rer.
> Je comprend qu'ils veulent vacciner un maximum de personnes, mais si au final on le fait tout croche et √ßa ne marche pas, on sera pas plus avanc√© et √ßa aura co√ªt√© une fortune et plusieurs vies.
Ouais, √ßa sonne comme la "strat√©gie" de la Su√®de pour vaincre le virus.
Google "First dose first". C'est la chose √† faire. √áa va √™tre la [politique officielle des √©tats-unis √† partir du 21 Janvier](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/08/politics/biden-vaccine-strategy/index.html).
On a quand meme des donn√©es, la. 1 dose est efficace a \~52% (cf Pfizer). Statistiquement, c'est mieux d'avoir 100 personnes de vaccin√© a 52% que 50 personnes a 92%. Cette strat√©gie est consid√©r√©e partout dans le monde.
Give them some time to get their messaging straight and in order.  It takes a while after you've been travelling for vacation to get back to your A-game at work...
Hiers Sant√© Canada a dit a la radio de SRC que c'est l'approvisionnement en vaccin qui bloque, pas la vaccination.
Qu√©bec has massively upped it's vaccine rollout speed to the point where the rate limiting factor is delivery of vaccines to the province.  This is expected to massively increase from mid January into February as Canada's delivery schedule improves.
Israel is moving very quickly (although they're not bothering to vaccinate Palestinians, which is absolutely disgraceful and pulls their share of population vaccinated down considerably), but Qu√©bec is going as fast as it reasonably can right now.
[deleted]
We vaccineted 80% of received doses, more than Ontario. Chill with the bureaucracy talk, were waiting for more doses.
remember they had 10 months to plan that vaccination campaign while we were in lockdown but politicians were too busy planning their vacation and flying around the world at Christmas so here we are
Israel is way ahead of the game internationally. WAY ahead in terms of population percentage. Bahrain I believe is second place, and only accomplished half of what Israel has accomplished.
Israel I think should should hit over 25% of the population vaccinated by the weekend and they only started less than a month ago!
What's even funnier. They have so many doses because they "overpaid" for the vaccine. Want to know cost? it's 2X so around 30$ a dose vs 10-15 canada paid. Instead, we bought almost 300M doses to distribute instead of spending on getting us vaccinated first quickly and efficiently. 
A complete failure so far.
Israel followed he single dose approach as well. They also have mandatory military service for all citizens so mass mobilizations are easy.
Yes, there is no way they would withdraw doses. Biden is planning to switch to First Doses First as well. It is becoming standard procedure.
[deleted]
He will. I have almost no doubt.
You prefer going back to the Liberals mafia?  Because the PQ are dead or dying and QS will never be big enough to reach power.
Le f√©d√©ral ach√®te et r√©partit les vaccins entre les provinces en proportion de la population. Mais c'est √† la charge des provinces (sant√© = comp√©tence provinciale) de distribuer les vaccins.
no
I don‚Äôt thing they were ever liable to start with.
But somehow he's still leading polls. I am confusion.
Nah, they just don't plan to reserve the 2nd dose. Instead they trust they'll be able to procure it from the supply chain, but they'll still give the second dose when it's supposed to be given.
Source?
>Si on donne une seule dose, l'immunit√© au bout de 21 jours est de 92%. L'intervalle de confiance est encore un d√©bat tho, notamment pour les personnes avec un syst√®me immunitaire faible.
Nobody knows how long that lasts. 
&#x200B;
This whole made-up one-dose protocol is because the CAQ can't organize anything, and is too weak to impose measures that will actually stop the pandemic.
Merci pour les infos!
> Espacer les doses jusqu'√† 12 semaines augmente la couverture virale (de 1 √† 2%). La probl√©matique est, que se passe-t-il si on d√©passe ce d√©lai?

C'est surtout ce "uncharted territory"-l√† qui inqui√®te..
Still a stupid plan.
The US is one of the very few places on the planet handling the pandemic worse than Quebec. Why follow them?
&#x200B;
EDIT   
The data DOES NOT show that one dose is good enough \*because that was never studied\*. 
Anyone who tells you that one dose is enough is lying to you.
Ca a √©t√© r√©p√©t√© beaucoup que Biden allait faire la m√™me chose, mais ce n'est pas le cas. Biden ne va pas garder la deuxi√®me dose en r√©serve effectivement, mais il croit que l'√©ch√©ancier des livraisons sera capable de fournir les deuxi√®me doses a temps. Donc il ne repousse pas les deuxi√®me doses, il ne garde pas de r√©serve pour.
>A transition official said the Biden team believes that vaccine manufacturers will be able to produce enough second doses in a timely fashion
Le Qu√©bec ne va pas utiliser les nouvelles livraisons pour administrer la deuxi√®me dose. Le plan est de l'administr√© en mars, soit 3 mois apr√®s la premi√®re environ.
Le 52% est une m√©trique absurde. C'est la moyenne sur les 21 premiers jours sauf que l'efficacit√© les premiers 7-12 jours est effectivement 0.
Apres la p√©riode d'incubation l'efficacit√© est de 90% selon les stats de Pfizer. Le probl√®me c'est combien de temps √ßa va durer sans un **booster shot**, pas l'efficacit√©.

The Palestinians haven‚Äôt asked for Israel‚Äôs help with vaccine distribution and instead went to Russia. It‚Äôs not Israel‚Äôs responsibility to involuntarily vaccinate Palestinians.
that's a 10-15$ difference per dose max. 
Instead, we bought 10X supply to distribute worldwide to poor countries. 
I have no problem with us distributing to help the world but, for 300M$ why the hell didn't we overpay for the first doses too if we are willing to buy so much supply longterm anyway?
Wtf it's actually pretty good !
That Montreal font looks like the one used on bubly cans lol
I love the logo I wish they would pay you for it!
The white part kinda looks like a KKK hood.
That's a pretty fantastic logo!
This is dank. I like this a lot and I'm not even into football.
Looks cool but the alouette looks like a duck
J'adore!
Je choisirais peut-√™tre un rouge un peu plus fonc√©, un peu moins tape-√†-l'oeil, qui pourrait aussi rappeler les Canadiens. Autrement, excellent design!
I really like this idea and I want to commend you on your good work.
However, and I'm so sorry to say, but the alouette on top of the logo reminds me of a Klan hood.
Maybe a change of color to distinguish the bil from the rest of the head.
I see a klan's man hood with the eyes... i can't unsee it
Dire qu'ils ont pay√© un prix surement compl√®tement fou pour l'horreur d√©voil√©e en 2019...

Sorry but I have to say it‚Ä¶ it look like a penis
Compared to any professional team uniforce, NFL, NHL,NBA, MLB. Sorry but this is ugly.
The logo looks like an angry banana.
That's not bad at all!
Not really into football but this is great!
Nice work! Please share them on /r/CFL :)
Let me know when you got some t-shirt or caps like that, i'm in!
Very creative. Love it.
No original. Kinda of a up copy of the Trois-Rivi√®res Lions logo.
Wow bien jou√© !
Bravo!
I fucking love it, personally, this is super clean!
C tippy top √ßa
I like this for Montreal. It‚Äôs much better than what they have now
I would buy a Jersey now wtf
This is sick
Magnifique
i like the jersey looks modern and simplistic with nice french colors you should submit it  see what happens
Anyone else sees a üåΩ?
I'm a designer. It's very good. One criticism. I like the Montreal with the al in blue on the uniform. However, I'm not sure it works with the full name montrealouettes with the al coloured with Alouettes. I'm not sure. Just something to think about. I went to design school so I must criticize everything. Again it's all very good. May I ask, what is the idea behind the logo?
Nice color scheme, very bold and much better than the navy blue and that ugly burfundy they have sported for a while. Montr√©al should be bleu-blanc-rouge, the color of champions. 
Typewise it's a bit too retro for my taste but it works. Nice touch to put the emphasis on the 'al' by elevating it, event though just the color switch is enough to make your point IMO.
The bird unfortunately gets lost in the composition. I can decode your intention but when i squint my eyes it looks too much like a ram with something on its head.
That navy 'al' looks kinda jank. the al spacing is off , needs kerning between the √© and the a. the navy is also really hard to read on the red. i'd be worried for people who are color blind.
You won me over with the montr√©AL... Great idea. Love the logo and color design as well. Very good üëè
link to the other rebrands!
Wow actually really good! This is sick! They should buy it from you!
I'm sold
Delete this post before they hijack your idea without giving you any credit lol. Great job!
It's not a style I like personally, but it is very well done. Clever integration of the names and of the fleur de lys/bird.
it might be just  me, it kinda look either klansmen or mighty duck
I love the Montr√© alouettes
On s'en crisse.
Really bad.  You think it‚Äôs good, but it‚Äôs not.
Very jaunty
Love the compromise between the bland/corporate current logo and the college-esque previous logo
There's an awesome boardgame bar somewherevin MTL
Geaux Alou-ain‚Äôts!! I cheer for the Saints based on the fleur de lis, proud to be a quebecer(Anglo quebecois with ties all the way back to les filles du roi) Love this new design.
I switched to French's ketchup in protest when they left (like a lot of people). I'm not going to switch back. Heinz has too much sugar. French's tastes more like ketchup.
If I‚Äôm not mistaking it‚Äôs the same factory that makes the Kraft diner mac & cheese. That place will soon be made a national landmark.
Too late... French s ketchup 4ever
On s'en c√¢lice de Heinz et French's. Maintenant on a [Canada Sauce](https://canadasauce.com/) et [Firebarns](https://firebarns.com/) ansi que [MAG Mayonnaise](https://mayonnaisemag.com/) qui sont des compagnies qu√©b√©coises et qui plus est, utilisent autant que possible des produits de fermes locales pour faire leurs produits.
Et laissez-moi vous dire que leurs condiment sont crissement meilleurs. Je n'achete rien d'autre depuis que j'ai d√©couvert ces produits.
there are way better options for ketchup out there

They only do this as marketing to re gain their part of the quebecois market. #nothanks
I find the boycott of heinz ketchup one of the few times where consumers collectively got together and fought back against a company that actively screwed over Canadian workers.  I feel like buying it now would make me feel conflicted.   
Are they using Canadian sourced tomatoes?
I'm not switching back from French. You traitors.
Je me souviens.
Sweet, I can buy Heinz again lol. I actually like French's too though. It's different but also good.
I really love how we all came together to protest Heinz when they moved. 
They just seem like monkey hungry capitalists though with the back and forth and I can‚Äôt respect them. 
But hopefully the food market will increasingly respect Canadian manufacturing as a result.
* Still won't use Canadian grown tomatoes...
I'm all over French's now. As other have posted... but jobs are good also.
Anyway, Sauce Sriracha over ketchup anytime!
Most of you need to educate yourselves better on this topic. https://open.lib.umn.edu/principleseconomics/chapter/17-1-the-gains-from-trade/
Wow, it‚Äôs like having CERN or a new aerospace company invest here‚Ä¶.
I prefer sunspun anyways... but I'm weird.
The real travesty is the fact the apparently *all* the oranges and bananas you see in the grocery store are grown by dirty foreigners. We should continue these boycotts until there are no more imports and Canada is an entirely self-sufficient country.
Ketchup sucks anyway lol
Obligatory fuck ketchup.
Yuck, people still use that crap
I like it more too, but I find French's has a lower viscosity, kind of a bit too runny.
I worked there for a summer job a few years ago, and I don't recall the KD Mac&Cheese being produced there. What I recall seeing on the production lines were Philadelphia cheese spreads, Kraft Singles, BBQ sauces and salad vinaigrettes. 
It's been a while though and it was before the Heinz merger. Maybe I'm mistaken or it changed since then.
√âdith : cette [offre d'emploi](https://careers.kraftheinz.com/careers/PipelineDetail/M-canicien-de-machineries-fixes/35569) parle de "Notre grande √©quipe est fi√®re de produire des produits hautement populaires dont le Beurre d'arachides- fromage Philadelphia- Kraft Dinner- Vinaigrettes et beaucoup plus!". T'as peut-√™tre raison finalement
And peanut butter and microwave popcorn. I used to work close by and you'd occasionally get a hard whiff of foods-you_ciukd_make_when-you're-nine-years-old

[QUETCHUP](https://canadasauce.com/en/pages/quetchup)
Seriously, fuck Heinz and their high fructose corn syrup and red die garbage.
J'apprecie connaitre les produits de chez nous
Mag Mayo is hella nice
Firebarns Lime c‚Äôest de la bonne sauce! Je viens d‚Äôessayer leur sauce bbq bourbon aussi, wow, g√©niale aussi.
Est-ce que le ketchup go√ªte la m√™me chose que le Heinz en terme de texture?
O√π est-ce que c'est motoneux etc?
Bof, Firebarns est ben ordinaire c√¥t√© sauce forte.
Mag Mayo est incroyable par contre.
J'ai remplac√© le ketchup par la sriracha donc je regarde cette bagarre commerciale d'un air amus√©. Mais c'est cool de voir des entreprises du Qu√©bec se hisser dans ces milieux difficiles √† percer.
Of course there is better option. Im just comparing the most available option. Its like Coke and Pepsi, I prefer Coke but there is clearly better option (less sugar, no fructose/glocose syrop, organic ingredient).
Kimchi Ketchup? Int√©ressant!
mind you greenhouse tomatoes suck anyways and that's probably what most of these ketchups are made with and intensive farming/industrial agriculture is no better,
just grow your own tomatoes or try to find a farmers market that grows their own tomatoes and eat them whole
Providing a cheaper product by producing it where it can be made more efficiently helps Canadian workers.
That seems to be part of their attempt at a return. Stay strong! French's!
Le lobbyisme de Heinz doit √™tre fort en tbk parce que le Ketchup a disparu des tablettes dans au moins 2 √©piceries que je fr√©quente r√©guli√®rement.
Anyway, sauce Sriracha 4 ever.
Monkey hungry capitalists are the worst type of monkey.
Who cares? Why does it matter what country they're grown in?

I work there too a few years ago in IT and its definitely there, but this place is so huge its like a city. Its possivle to work in one place and not see it all. I had to go everywhere for IT. 
What you see in the internal store is all made there. I think if you're a full time employee KD is like 35 cents if not cheaper. I bought alot at the store lol
I don't see Leonard Cohen. Are you sure this is a photo of Montr√©al?

Aww man, I‚Äôm like a few meters from being in this picture.
yeah, it's a beautiful day haha, life is good, but it can be better(ww84)
I miss walking downtown during lunchtime
what about now?
Looks like a Recon contract is in progress, should we push em?
Looks like a good fine day sir
It was gorgeous out today
Lovely shot!
On the darker side, you can really see what a dogpile of shit garbage the surface ~~Sherbrooke Street~~ is.
*edit: hmmm, not Sherbooke methinks. Trying to piece this one out. Whatever street it is, it's in horrid condition.
*edit 2: Oh, it's De Bleury! Also a steaming pile of bumpy-ass pavement. Horrible.
How is it right now with the restrictions? My friends and I are thinking about visiting next month.
<3
That's amazing. I can see my old work building just poking out from the corner but it's all changing so quickly.
it was an amazing day! Walk 12K steps and stopped at ***Au Coq Frit*** on St-Laurent pour manger du bon poulet frit mmmmm .... I will never eat these ever again, c'est fuckin bon et d√©gueulasse en m√™me temps.
Montr√©al is the most beautiful city in the world and Denis Codere want to fuck it all up.
Ah yes, I also like playing cities skyline xl !
Quel endroit?
You know whats crazy? I haven't visited the downtown in a while and today I decided to visit the downtown at the same time you took this pic.
That's not true, it's night time :(
No you're right, it must be Paris !
Moi qui pensais c'√©tait Antony Bourdain!
Il y aura deux tours d'environ 200m seront visibles sur cette photo (on voit d'ailleurs le chantier au centre-gauche de la photo).
Don't look at the streets tho
Like, as a tourist? At this moment things are pretty good. Masks are, rightfully so, still mandatory at any indoor public area. 
You will have to look into the quebec vaccine passport to do a number of things. I do some work coaching at a school, so that's the only thing I've experienced the need for it so far. It was only just implemented.
With students back in the city and the vaccine, the vibe is back, you'll love it :)
Tout est relatif. Ce n'est pas si dense m√™me s'il y a deux b√¢timents de 200 m de haut dispers√©s autour de cette zone.
Yes as a tourist we are flying from NYC and thinking of visiting but we are going to more into the restrictions. Happy to hear its pretty good over there at the moment.
Well, we had a good summer. Cases were very low. But as with last year, the start of school and probably some other factors I'm ignorant of have started trending us upwards. However, the vaccine passport should help greatly to curb the trend.
M√©tro projet√©, LOL!
*Berri-UQAM* s'appelait *Berri-De Montigny* jusqu'en 1988, alors je ne sais pas si on peut tellement appeler √ßa ¬´ des ann√©es 80 ¬ª.

Troublant que la pr√©sentation est plus belle que les plaques d'aujourd'hui
Pas de 3√® ligne?
Je ne me souvenais pas du fait que l'id√©e de la rallonge de c√¥te-vertu vers la ligne de train de banlieue √©tait si vielle... Et la ligne blanche... Les autobus sur pie-ix passent aux quatre minutes... √áa fait trop longtemps qu'ils attendent.
Hmm, the white line sounds like a good idea to offload the orange line and cut commute time for east island.
I guess even back then nobody saw the point of connecting the orange line in the north. Sad.
Je mennui de mon L'assomption
Ann√©es 90 aussi non? Me semble c‚Äôest la m√™me carte que dans mon enfance
De memoire, cette image daterais plus des annee 90. Dans les annee 80 c'etait la CTCUM et la ligne bleu arretait a De Castelneau  me semble. (je la prenais au quand j'etais au secondaire)
[deleted]
On s'en va a Ronde!
Ca pas changer tant que √ßa, je pen√ßais quils avais ralonger ca beaucoup plus en 40 ans.
c'est le fun de voir qu'un design des ann√©es 80 est encore d'actualit√©.
√ßa bien vieilli.
Lol.  Virtually nothing has changed.  Give it a couple years though.
Want!
Pis... Est-ce qu'on conna√Æt la raison pour laquelle il n'y a pas de ligne 3? Je me suis toujours pos√© la question.
Je suis designer de produit sur une plateforme num√©rique, et on s'est r√©cemment questionn√© sur l'accessibilit√© de nos couleurs... Des outils nous permettent de savoir si certains contrastes sont assez lisibles et l'utilisation du blanc sur jaune est une des paires les moins performantes. 
Je remarquais justement dans le m√©tro cette fds √† quel point la ligne jaune √©tait tr√®s peu accessible visuellement, parce que le rond blanc n'a pas de contour noir aidant √† la d√©marquer du fond... Comme c'√©tait pourtant le cas dans les ann√©es 80 apparemment. Je suis surpris qu'ils aient d√©cider de l'enlever. Mais je comprends aussi qu'il est trop facile de prioriser l'uniformit√© esth√©tique au d√©pends des personnes avec faiblesses visuelles.
Tk, c'est un d√©tail vu de mon monde!
C'est quand j'√©tais √©tudiant.... √† l'√©poque ou on pouvait faire des jokes pis dire ses opinions... C'√©tait le bon temps... (chu n√© en 68, donc si tu veux r√©pondre ''OK Boomer'', tu vas faire de l'enculage de mouches).
La ligne blanche HAHAHAHAHAHA
Est ce que c‚Äôest juste moi ou la station Universit√© de Montr√©al s‚Äôappelait Vincent d‚ÄôIndy avant?
Aucun train au Rive Sud lol
Comment √ßa que Lionel Groulx n‚Äôest pas encore station Oscar Peterson et Beaudry n‚Äôest pas Beaudry-Village?
C‚Äôest malheureux, le graphisme n‚Äôa vraiment chang√© depuis
LOL hahaha looks the same to me. I dream about the metro being way better. I even found this (from a previous reddit thread), which makes me drool. One day...probably never though.

la mythique ligne blanche... ca sonne totalement '80, faire une ligne blanche.
Ils sont toujours d‚Äôactualit√© le pire!
Je suis un dinosaure, je vois la ligne bleue et je me dis: ah c'est pas si vieux comme carte.
Tu as raison pour la station Berri-de-Montigny. Cependant, je sais que c‚Äôest des ann√©es 80 car apr√®s les ann√©es 90, c‚Äôest devenu du carton.
Le plan date de 1988 selon [ce document](https://web.archive.org/web/20081209093901/http://www.stcum.qc.ca/info/infostm/2004/040310.pdf).  Logique qu'ils aient chang√© le plan lorsqu'ils ont renomm√© Berri.
Est-ce que la ligne bleue existait d√©j√† en ‚Äò80?    
Edit: oui, [milieu et fin ‚Äò80 mettons](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Metro_Montreal_Evolution.gif/310px-Metro_Montreal_Evolution.gif)
Il y a longtemps, au m√©tro Snowdon, il y avait d'anciennes affiches o√π l'on pouvait voir "Berry-De Montigny", alors que √ßa faisait d√©j√† des ann√©es que le nom avait chang√©.
Oh, man, I came back to visit and keep thinking: Montmorency, what direction is that?

La Boutique STM vend des affiches version 2001, 2003, 2004 et 2012 [sur sa boutique](https://www.boutiquestm.com/en/posters/). C'est pas exactement retro mais c'est des affiches authentiques qui viennent des wagons de Metro et pas des reproductions.

La ligne #3 (ligne rouge) devait aller de la gare centrale jusqu'√† pierrefond en utilisant le tunnel sous le mont royal et continuer ensuite en surface. 
La ligne jaune √† √©t√© devanc√© avant la ligne rouge en raison des besoins de l'expo 67
Ensuite la lugne rouge n'a jamais ete faite quoi que D'une certaine fa√ßon le train de Deux-Montagne et le REM sont les h√©ritier de cette ligne.
La 3 eme ligne devait passer dans le tunnel CN mont royal mais a √©t√© annul√©e.
Je me pose la meme question
Je me demande si le Casino fait vraiment quelque chose de concret pour la communaut√© LGBTQ2S+, ou si c'est qu'une campagne de 'sensibilisation'.
L'endroit o√π je travaille fait un peu la m√™me chose et je nous trouve hypocrite d'allumer nos building d'une mani√®re comme √ßa sans qu'on fasse des trucs concrets pour la communaut√©.
Casino don‚Äôt give a fuck about anybody let alone LGBTQ2S+  lol! Companies need to just stop with this shit.

Pour r√©pondre √† 2 commentaires ici:
Le Casino de Montr√©al commandite le festival de la fiert√© depuis au minimum 2016 si on se fit √† leur site web. Ils ont aussi accueilli plusieurs artistes ou spectacles LGBTQIAA+ au fil des ans. Leur r√©seaux sociaux (ex: instagram) pr√©sente aussi des drag queens ou autres personalities queer pas juste au mois de la fiert√© depuis des ann√©es.

Bin oui, j'ai fait une typo, d√©sol√©
2Spirits mais honn√™tement c'est un peu bord√©lique avec tout le monde qui essaie de s'approprier l'acronyme et que la version de l'ann√©e d'avant est toujours rendu offensif pour certaines communaut√©s. 
Il y a aussi LGBTTIQQ2SAA et d'autres versions que j'ignore probablement.
Using an entire community to draw attention away that is the evil of gambling for a little good will and a pat on the back... Yeah you‚Äôre so right lol.

Oh.. ok jpense comprendre.. jpense jva continuer de dire lgbtq juste psrceque plus ce deviens long on sait de qui on parle.
That is neither what I said nor the point. 
I never said "casino is good because x-y-z" I answered to your specific mention of "casino doesn't give a fuck about LGBTQ2S+" as well as someone else who mentioned "I wonder if the casino is doing something concrete for the community"  
with more facts about what Casino has done for the community.
As for if they're a moral company who cares about its customers. At this point it might be more a personal opinion based. I mean it's a Casino, what do you expect? I have a crazy notion for you: most companies don't give a s\*\*t about their customers. They're corporation, their only care is making money. periodt.
Tu sais que le casino est une entit√© gouvernementale? On est quand m√™me pas √† Las Vegas voyons.

The only thing you can do in these situations is call the cops while the other driver is acting like an idiot. Caught a fucking idiot driving like a maniac and called the police once I got home with the license plate. Nothing they can do as they can‚Äôt prove who was driving. They told me best thing is to call while it‚Äôs happening. Bad drivers are the worst.

C'est bon √† savoir
Moi je fais juste appeler sans preuves mais je donne les infos de ce que j'ai vu et je me dis que si on est 2-3 personnes sans aucun lien √† le rapporter, ils vont bin accepter que c'est arriv√© et au minimum mettre une note au dossier, possiblement charger la personne. En plein traffic de la 20 √† 6h du matin y'a 2-3 ans j'ai vu une BMW faire des d√©passements vraiment dangeureux, couper genre 5 personnes diff√©rentes, crisser les brakes, d√©passer par l'accotement, essayer de swerver pour faire peur/crisser le monde en dehors de la route. Un moment le passager est sorti le chest du char et frappait sur la porte/fen√™tre d'un 18 roues avec un b√¢ton de hockey en plein milieu du pont-tunnel. Des ostis de maniaques. J'ai tout d√©cris en live pendant que √ßa arrivait et je serais tr√®s surpris que personne des 100 quelques autres personnes qui aient vu √ßa ai appel√© aussi. Je connais pas exactement les lois mais J'ESP√àRE que 3-4 personnes qui sont chacun dans leur char et qui d√©crivent plus ou moins exactement la m√™me sc√®ne dangeureuse avec un num√©ro de plaque serait assez pour des accusations.
Ben oui avec une descriptions autant d√©taill√©e, pis c'est clair que dans le ptit patelin hochelaga tout le monde se connais... /s
Exact thing I did. Wrote it up in french in another comment here but I witnessed an absolute maniac road raging and being extra extra dangerous (brake checking semis in rush hour traffic, overtaking on the shoulder and hitting cars and trucks with a hockey stick while driving in the H-L Tunnel type of shit). Hope to god 2 or 3 other people called and reported his ass so there was no question it happened so we can get this maniac off the road.

C'est drole, j'aime pas trop le gambling et l'idee du casino donc je suis jamais aller ou cherchez ou il √©tais.
Went once many moons ago. There was very little ambience unless you consider no smiling people and   terrible drink service to be a good time. I admit I played slots and Keno due to overcrowding at the $10 blackjack tables, but it was a dreary atmosphere. I've been to Vegas and Atlantic City and can say that Montr√©al does not have a clue about making casinos fun. I managed to turn $200 into $800, but I really had no fun doing it. I will never go back.

You didn't go at the right time then. You need to go when they have special occasion festivities on friday or saturday night.
C'est quand m√™me un vestige important de l'Expo 67. C'est l√©gitime de le trouver p√¢ bo, mais √ßa reste un b√¢timent int√©ressant autant historiquement qu'architecturalement.
Est-ce que c'est du sarcasme ou est-ce qu'on a une d√©finition diff√©rente de "beau"? On dirait la partie de plastique grise random qui faisait partie de ton lave-vaisselle mais s'est d√©tach√©e et maintenant tu sais pas quoi faire avec.

Any, time.
Wednesday afternoon not a special enough occasion for you?
I'm not a gambler to begin with and find that it's really a tax on the stupid, so I know I won't be going back. And I was there on either a Friday or Saturday night and certainly won't lose any sleep over it. One of my former colleagues just couldn't get enough of the place and used to try to convince me to go with her. It just isn't my thing really.
Aucun sarcasme. Ensuite, les go√ªts sont dans la nature alors je ne vais pas essayer de vous convaincre. Mais malgr√© votre comparaison bouetteuse, je placerais ce b√¢timent facilement dans le top 25 des plus significatifs de Montr√©al √† cause de son unicit√©, son architecture et son histoire.
Ahh oui les personnes √¢g√©es "attach√©es" aux machine avec leur carte fid√©lit√©, √ßa agr√©mente toujours les weekends!

Sunk cost fallacy
Il est beau architecturalement. Apr√®s c'est subjectif, mais c'est pas mal accept√© que c'est une belle oeuvre. 
Quel b√¢timent est beau selon toi?
Le march√© Bonsecours, l'Oratoire Saint Joseph...
Pis dans le patrimoine contemporain (genre depuis les ann√©es 40-50) ?
Je sais pas, il faudrait me donner des exemples de b√¢timents qui datent de ces d√©cennies. Mais en g√©n√©ral l'architecture contemporaine je n'aime pas trop. Et puis l'architecture c'est pas comme d'autres formes d'art comme la musique par exemple. Si t'aimes pas la musique contemporaine, personne te force √† en √©couter. Si t'aime pas l'architecture contemporaine, ben t'es quand m√™me oblig√© de voir √ßa √† chaque fois que tu sors de chez toi. Et on sait bien que ce style contemporain a tendance √† ne pas plaire √† beaucoup de gens. Moi j'aime bien Schoenberg (compositeur), mais je vais pas aller chier sur les gens qui trouvent √ßa laid. La plupart des gens pr√©f√®rent Chopin (moi aussi, soit-dit en passant). Si j'√©tais DJ, je mettrais Chopin plut√¥t que Schoenberg, parce que Chopin √ßa passe mieux. Chopin c'est beau. Schoenberg c'est c√©r√©bral, c'est de l'exp√©rimentation. Alors pareil pour l'architecture: qu'on privil√©gie la chose qui pla√Æt au plus grand nombre de gens quand il s'agit de b√¢timents que des milliers des gens vont voir tous les jours pendant des d√©cennies, et qui n'ont pas le choix. Les humains ont besoin de vivre dans de beaux environnements.
La Place Ville-Marie, la Tour de la Bourse, la tour CIBC, le 500 Place d'Armes, la tour Telus, le 1250 Ren√©-Levesque et le 1000 de la Gaucheti√®re sont des b√¢timents reconnus pour √™tre beaux. 
Tu peux ne pas aimer, mais des b√¢timents comme la Place-Ville-Marie, c'est pas mal un fait que c'est architecturellement beau.
Pointe-Claire village area really is a gorgeous part of our city. Say what you want about the West Island, it really has a charm around there
Marchez pas sur le fleuve, la glace est encore tr√®s fragile.
Gasp you mentioned West Island here. Came for the lectures on how bad suburbs are and such. Left satisfied lol
Pointe-Claire b√©b√©.
Bourgeau park... Did some late night drinking there many a time in my younger days... It's Lac St-Louis at that point if my √©cole primaire G√©ographie du Qu√©bec serves me well.
Just moved to Pointe Claire from Nova Scotia. We love it here !!!
Ce n'est pas gel√© plus dur que √ßa maintrnant, ou est-ce une photo qui a √©t√© prise il y a deux mois?
This is a beautiful picture!!!!
The West is great, i mean , i live in Kirkland , got owls  in the woods on the other side of the street ,  you hear the coyotes  at night  ,got a giant  nature park  to go walk or bike throught  , Cap St Jacque beach  is like 1o min biking away from my place  , that the plus of living in kirkland  , you get to enjoy the city and nature
West Island is like another city entirely. In many way's it's like a typical north american suburb - which isn't a bad thing, normally, but it does clash with the more French style of some of the other boroughs. But it's not bad at all and it's a nice place to raise kids. 
In my experience it's mostly got a bad reputation because of the bored west island kids driving their parent's beamers going 140 on the 20, and all the fucked up rich kids coming from the area (I know so many West Island kids who just leaned in hard on partying and drugs). That and the enclave of uptight anglos who find it an affront to suggest they might want to learn French at some point.
The whole west island south of the 20 is quite nice.
Y'avais une epoque ou l'on pouvait se promener sur le fleuve, non? Je ne sais pas si on pouvait le croiser directement, mais du moins sur le bord du fleuve. Ou est-ce que je me trompe?
Awesome and welcome
Il y a quelques semaines depuis.
Thanks
What city are you enjoying there?
I was cleaning out my personal external HDD and found an old Word doc from the early days of email.  It was something I got by way of a chain forwarded to me, but it was  basically "you know you're from the West Island when..." It was a fairly long list.  You just reminded me of it... I'm not sure if I kept it or not, but if I did I'll post. 
I will say, having grown up and still living in the West Island, the reputation is well earned and deserved by a great portion of us.  I'm guilty of it even though I was not one of the "rich kids".  I can say when I met my wife, who grew up off island, she genuinely had a real distaste for "West Island boys" as she put it.  We were all snobs, stuck up, conceited, etc...I won her over eventually, but the reputation was/is real.  I certainly recognize that I had a privileged life as compared to many others.  My mom worked only later on in my younger years.  We were members at one of the many West Island public pools, a community and culture that is unique to the West Island or Western portion of the island.  Things were definitely different for us.  
In that list I mentioned... One of the items was "you know you're from the West Island when you start freaking out when you go east of Sources.  I spent many nights downtown so that wasn't an issue for me, but I can see how that applied back then.  These days, there's no more bars or clubs like we had then to keep us here.  Just last night I saw the Village for the first time without The Pioneer!  Cheers, O'Toole's, Quai Sera, Bourbon Street West, etc...all gone.  There's a few gastro pubs now, but no true bars anymore.  Kids want to go out now, they have to go downtown. 
There is an influx of francophones to the West Island and it is nice to see that.  My girls are growing up fully bilingual like I did(thanks to my parents) and will probably use their French through their younger years much more than I did.  
It's still a great place to raise kids and you'd have to do a lot to get us to move from here.  We've have had offers in TO and the US, but they were just not appealing enough to leave.
Edit: it is different from the rest of the island, but compared to off island communities, speaking in an infrastructure and urban planning sense...it's the same, but closer to the city.
>which isn't a bad thing
Ben, √† part pour l'environnement, l'√©conomie et la sant√© publique.
I go 130-140 daily on the 20. Cops only really hang out at Cartier. My biggest issue are geezers rolling 90 in the left lane.
On pouvait facilement traverser le fleuve entre Saint-Lambert et Ville-Marie au 18e et 19e si√®cle. Il y avait m√™me un train qui roulait sur la glace!
Les Rapides ont toujours √©t√© sans glace et pour le lac Saint-Louis, je ne sais pas. 
Toutefois, il y a une d√©c√©nnie, on √©tait en mesure de marcher dans les premiers 100m du fleuve dans le Bassin de Laprairie sans probl√®me. J'ai march√© dessus il y a deux semaines et je suis tomb√© au travers de la glace √† environ 5m du rivage. Il y a des endroits o√π c'est √©pais sur une bonne distance, mais ce n'est plus du tout aussi s√©curitaire qu'avant.
C‚Äô√©tait vraiment tr√®s beau
I just love the West Island..... üòçüòçüòç‚ù§Ô∏è
> Kids want to go out now, they have to go downtown.
AFAIK that's always been the case. Whenever we'd hit a place either downtown (which I absolutely loathe) or on St-Laurent (which is better but only barely) it was always full of West Island kids and American kids.
The bigger issue for me is driving to/from the West Island, where my sister lives, and invariably there's two idiots in Beamer/Audis going extremely fast on the high way trying to weave through traffic and race each other. On more than one occasion I saved my ass and my kid's lives with a last minute correction as one of these geniuses decided to traverse 2 lanes without signaling, or something equally stupid. That's my biggest pet peeve.
But it goes with the drugs/drinking of the West Island kids. No joke I know a few kids from let's say Kirkland who have been on and off the wagon for the better part of a decade now. It's depressing.
l'environment oui, mais pas necessairement. Genre les nouvelles maisons bien isolees sont moins nocives ques des vielles batisses mal mainetenus du debut 20ieme sciecle. Les chars, ca pollue, mais ca va avoir moins d'impact quand tout le mond fera la swtich aux chars electriques.
Pour l'economie et la sante publique tu peux etre plus precis?
Maybe that's also another problem - the police should actually have a presence rather than just fuck around and do nothing and then give tickets to students for stupid ass reasons.
Also, just because you can doesn't mean you should do 140. You're on the highway in the middle of the night and nobody is around? Go nuts, you won't kill anyone other than yourself. Go 140 when there's traffic, fuck you, you're going to kill someone. But I agree people going 90 on the left lane are just as bad.
shit, j'ai une peur mortelle de tomber a travers de la glace.
Merci
I do to. I moved there.
I find that most of the fucked up West Island kids came from Kirkland. Especially those that grew up in the new development next to the coli.
Literally no different than Laval kids
L'impact sur l'environnement des banlieue est vraiment important. Premi√®rement, l'√©talement urbain d√©truit la biodiversit√© et les √©cosyst√®mes tout en aggravant les probl√®mes d'inondations. Deuxi√®mement, la banlieue de faible densit√© vient avec un mode de vie ax√© presque enti√®rement sur l'automobile, ce qui est tr√®s n√©faste pour les changements climatiques. Le fait que tu aies besoin de l'auto pour pas mal tous tes d√©placements, √ßa finit par √©mettre beaucoup de dioxyde de carbone.
Financi√®rement, le mod√®le de d√©veloppement de basse densit√© des banlieues n'est pas viable pour les municipalit√©s. Pour d√©sservir le m√™me nombre de logements et de personnes, il faut beaucoup plus d'infrastructures, couteuses √† construire et √† maintenir. 
Pour la sant√© publique, la surutilisation de l'automobile engendre des √©missions de contaminants dans l'air qui sont responsables de plusieurs centaines ou milliers (je n'ai plus la donn√©e exacte, mais il me semble que c'est genre 4000) d√©c√®s pr√©matur√©s √† Montr√©al. Aussi, la surutilisation de l'automobile est associ√©e avec une hausse des accidents routiers (avec pi√©tons, cyclistes et autres voitures). Finalement, toujours en raison de la surutilisation de la voiture, plus la densit√© d'un milieu urbain est basse, plus les taux de s√©dentarisation sont √©lev√©s. Comme la s√©dentarisation est la cause de maladies comme l'ob√©sit√© et des probl√®mes cardiaques, ces derniers ont aussi des taux plus √©lev√©s dans les banlieues de basse densit√©.
130-140 is a reasonable speed. If you are cutting in and out of traffic ok it's stupid but driving in a straight line in a modern car on a well maintained road it's perfectly fine in good weather. In the wet or snow? Nah
North Americans have been brainwashed into "all speed is bad and you'll die" the issue here is people aren't disciplined in what proper driving is. So yes if you want to poodle around at 100kph I won't make fun of you but if you move to pass someone check your bloody mirrors. I'd actually say driving on west island surface streets is more annoying with endless stop signs vs the 20. Montreal in general has a hard on for stop signs. In my area they're every 100m for no fucking reason 
Speeding on the 40 no thanks. Too congested. Nothing over 110-115 until Vaudreuil. 
Go drive at 70 on the new turcot you'll get run over.
Je jamais eu cette peur, mais criss que j'ai eu la chienne. 5m plus loin pis mes pieds auraient pas touch√© le fond, je serais peut-√™tre mort.
Par contre l'eau est pas tant froide et j'ai pas du tout eu froid durant les ~30 min de marche pour revenir chez moi. Si tu tombes dans l'eau, enleves tes vetements mouill√©s et essaye de faire sortir le plus d'eau possible d'eux. T'es mieux d'√™tre dehors pas de pantalons que d'en porter qui sont gorg√©s d'eau.
I don't know what that is, but I'd have to agree. Pointe Claire and Dorval kids are mostly chill. Kirkland it's like a roll of the dice if you're getting someone sane or a complete drug addled psycho. No idea about DDO.
got to agree , the coli back in the days was wild, so many fights , someone  i knew  ,got stabbed 10 times  in front of the Timmies
You prob live in some crummy 1.5 where you can hear your neighbors taking a shit
> biodiversit√© et les √©cosyst√®mes
Oui, mais l'impact est presque negligeable si l'on compare cela a disons l'agriculture. 
> vient avec un mode de vie ax√© presque enti√®rement sur l'automobile, 
Oui, mais comme je disait ci dessus, avec un systeme de transport plutot neutre vis a vis le carbonne c'est pas si critique, et ce surtout si l'on commence a voir de plus en plus de teletravail, ce qui minimise les desplacement ainsi que les embouteillages.
> Financi√®rement, le mod√®le de d√©veloppement de basse densit√© des banlieues n'est pas viable pour les municipalit√©s. Pour d√©sservir le m√™me nombre de logements et de personnes, il faut beaucoup plus d'infrastructures, couteuses √† construire et √† maintenir.
D'accord, mai ca ne nuit pas a l'economie. Ca nuit au finances des municipalites. Ce qui, en fait, suggererait qu'ils vont soit devoir s'habituer a avoir moins de services ou tout simplement a les payer plus cher. Ce sont leur taxes qui vont payer ces services. 
> Pour la sant√© publique, la surutilisation de l'automobile engendre des √©missions de contaminants dans l'air
Ok, mais si on passe a l'electrique, ce qu'on devrait faire dans 10-20 ans a peu pres, petit a petit...
Genre, ce que tu dis n'est pas faux, mais ce sont des problemes communs aux societes modernes. P-e exacerbees dans certains cas par le manque de densite, mais problemes communs a tous quand meme. D'ailleurs il y a quand meme des aspect nefastes aux grosse ville densement populees aussi.
The Coli is the Kirkland Colisee movie theater. DDO is interesting in that it ranges from very rich to pretty poor. Otherwise, it is a painfully average suburb with no unifying ethos, as opposed to Pointe Claire or Beaconsfield which feel like unique little towns. I will say that the rich kids in DDO were not burnouts like those from Kirkland. There must be something in the water, haha.
Non, j'habite dans une unifamilliale en banlieue et criss que j'ai h√¢te de d√©m√©nager.
>Oui, mais l'impact est presque negligeable si l'on compare cela a disons l'agriculture
Pas vraiment, m√™me si l'agriculture a un impact sur l'environnement, les champs accueuillent une plus grande biodiversit√© qu'une banlieue. De plus, il existe des pratiques durables, comme garder un bois√© de fond de terrain ou garder une bande riveraine. Aussi, l'agriculture est essentielle, la banlieue, non.
>Oui, mais comme je disait ci dessus, avec un systeme de transport plutot neutre vis a vis le carbonne c'est pas si critique, et ce surtout si l'on commence a voir de plus en plus de teletravail, ce qui minimise les desplacement ainsi que les embouteillages.
Bien sur, dans un monde id√©al le transport collectif serait d√©ploy√© partout et serait efficace et utilis√©. Or, c'est irr√©aliste.
>D'accord, mai ca ne nuit pas a l'economie. Ca nuit au finances des municipalites. Ce qui, en fait, suggererait qu'ils vont soit devoir s'habituer a avoir moins de services ou tout simplement a les payer plus cher. Ce sont leur taxes qui vont payer ces services. 
√áa nuit √† l'√©conomie, puisque les investissements en automobile n'apportent presque rien au Qu√©bec, contrairement au secteur du transport collectif. Aussi, si les finances d'une banlieue sont moins bonnes, les taxes des r√©sidents vont augment√©es et le pouvoir d'achat est ainsi diminu√©.
>Ok, mais si on passe a l'electrique, ce qu'on devrait faire dans 10-20 ans a peu pres, petit a petit...
L'auto √©lectrique est un bon pas, mais il ne faut pas se dire que c'est tout ce qu'il faut. Utiliser des autos √©lectriques, mais continuer √† s'√©taler ne r√®glera pas nos probl√®mes environnementaux. 
Je dois avouer que le West Island a un charme, mais reste que son mod√®le de d√©veloppement est mauvais sur pas mal tous les aspects.

Let's be honest. Everybody here is talking about pizza.
If the Avs are Montreal's next opponent, I hope they wear those Nordiques alternates.
Pas grave, les Jets ont fait pareil, √† part pour leur gardien de but.
Bruins have some serious injuries but you can't count em out yet. They only need to win two.
Get tickets???? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA, You are funny. Well, if you shit money, you may.
The same as every year: lots of money
I think things are entirely open in Florida so getting tickets wouldn't be out of the question. 
Here, it's season tickee holders only, or people who can afford the absolutely insane prices they're re-selling them for.
Semi-decent Goalie? The fuck you talking about? Every fucking NHL player is scared shitless of Price. So scared they fucking made rules last year off season just because Price existed.
It's because I've been wearing the same t-shirt for two weeks straight and that guy has been ordering pizza every game. :P
Meme chose, d'un cote je suis content du succes mais je suis triste de ne pas pouvoir etre a MTL ou regarder les matches puisque je suis en Europe.
J'entendu les feux d'artrifices depuis 15 seconds apres le but, et je habite dans Verdun
There's a guy on the Habs subreddit that has been ordering pizza every game for the last 7, which we all won. He is now our Lord and Saviour.
And mint tea.
I had friends get Habs tickets in Dallas a few years back for $35.  Sure that was a shitty year, but I was thinking that maybe since it would be down south that I might have a chance.
What were the rules changes??
> So scared they fucking made rules last year off season just because Price existed. 
I don't recall that... what are you referring to?
My friend told me I jinxed it for Jets' second goal. Thank you pizza guy for having my back!
Same, c'est √† c√¥t√© de chez nous en plus. Je croyais qu'il y avait un attentat
Are you serious?! That's awesome!  
I thought it was my neighborhood! 7 games ago, on the verge of elimination, I delivered a beer to my neighbor's before the game. Then they won. So next game my neighbor delivered the beer. Then we won. Then the other neighbor....  
We now have a ritual on game night: check your mailbox for beer!
It looks like he's our new Ginette Reno
Et un peu de vitriol !!!
That's a great tradition haha! Keep it up!

Magnifique !
I can see my house!
But seriously, I‚Äôm trying to orient myself with this photo and I‚Äôm wondering why I can‚Äôt see the Bell building located on the Jean-Talon station?  Is not as high as I think it should be in this photo?
Pretty cool! Looks quite surreal too, as if the pic had been snapped during some really weird eclipse or something.
Which channel is IR, and which is true color? I'm guesing red is IR and blue is true, but then there's no green so idk where the discrimination information comes from if the filter is a high pass 720nm
ü§Ø
Very cool pic and even better it's technique/hardware and not post-prod.
[deleted]
It's out of frame to left, I noticed it in another wider shot I did
It's a 720nm (720nm and beyond pass through) IR pass filter on a color camera, so all channels are IR. Each channel responds a bit differently to different IR wavelengths which simulates color (at 900+ they converge tho so those filters usually gjve a BW look straight out of camera afaik)
√áa pourrait √™tre pire, genre "big prostate"
ooooooooohhhhhhh that's cool
Hand written by design to make them seem like locals, not a business or anything. They‚Äôre preying on older people and the uninformed so they can try to buy a building below market value. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs obvious to some but it probably works on others.

It's a tactic. People who fall for this stuff are more willing to sell to (what appears to be) an individual entrepreneur from the neighborhood.

Apparemment, il y a une manifestation demain dans quelques villes dont Vancouver, Toronto et Ottawa, mais je ne suis pas s√ªr s'il y a quelque chose √† Montr√©al aussi.
Should have used crayons to be even more rustic and quaint.
My reading skills aren't so great so what I was able to glean from this letter when I received it was "please, sign me up for every obnoxious mailing/calling list you can think of and I am also interested in the Church of Latter Day Saints, can you help me arrange regular visits from them?" I can only assume that's why they included their phone number, real names, address and email.
Oh ive seen this. Their trick is to come off non-threatening with a personable handwritten print. They‚Äôre trying to buy up properties. Smart.
Quand ma grand-m√®re est morte en f√©vrier 2020. Elle √©tait propri√©taire du duplex dans lequel ont vivaient. Ont √©taient harcel√© √† tout les jours par des appels de sp√©culateurs immobilier, √† chaque matin sans exag√©rer. 7 jours par semaine, et aussi des lettres faussement manuscrite. Qui commen√ßais par des condol√©ances et faisant part de leurs d√©sirs d'acheter la maison. 
C'√©tait ma tante et son fr√®re les liquidateurs testamentaire. Son fr√®re est mort au mois d'aout. Le 23 d√©cembre 2020 ils/elles signaient les papiers pour la vente. Ceux qui ont achet√© ont pass√© tout le temp des f√™tes √† venir chez nous faire des travaux. Tandis que personnes pouvais se r√©unir pour f√™ter. Sans parler qu'ils faisais venir leurs amis pour qu'ils viennent voir. 
En plus j'ai pr√™ter $20,000 √† ma m√®re pour qu'elle respire un peu. Fallait en plus qu'elle mettent de l'argent pour du staging. C'√©tait le conseil de l'agente immobilier. La maison √©tais plus que centenaire. Fallait partir au mois de mai. La maison √©tait dans la famille depuis 60 ans. 
Pour ajouter l'injure √† l'insulte mon oncle √† l√®guer √† son chum, tout ce qui lui appartenais. environs quelques centaines de milliers. Maintenant il r√©clame la part sur la maison qui serais revenus √† mon oncle. Honn√™tement je souhaite vraiment que mon oncle br√ªle en enfer. 
Ont est maintenant rendus au mois d'aout 2021 on √† pas encore vu la couleur de l'argent. 
Je le sait que j'ai pas rapport avec mon histoire, mais chaque fois que je vois des histoires de sp√©culation immobili√®re. J'ai le sang qui bouille. La famille de ma m√®re c'est des pourritures, et ma m√®re c'est une vrai nouille. 
Fallais que √ßa sorte.
Les gens en recoivent toutes les semaines a Vancouver et Toronto. C'est rendu notre tour on dirait...
J'arrive de chez mon ami √† Ottawa... il les collectionnait.. Il en avait √† peu pr√®s une dizaine!
Side note... Nous payons le notaire comptant.. on s'en fout, c'est l'acheteur qui paye la partie achat... le vendeur aura toujours des frais!! Je suis professionnellement curieuse de savoir c'est quoi √ßa donne en vrai... Dans mon livre √† moi, √ßa sent l'erreur professionnelle √† plein nez...
"La solution priv√©r"
"des bonne"
Quand quelqu'un dit "Exp√©rience", je m'attends √† ce qu'il soit capable de faire de la mise en page par ordinateur. Si des √©l√®ves du secondaire sont capables de faire un travail de 10 pages et l'imprimer, je ne crois pas qu'un "groupe d'investisseurs" peut se contenter d'√©crire un message √† la main.
Le pire dans √ßa c'est qu'il sont bas√© en Ontario. On peut les trouver en cherchant dans le REQ (registre des entreprise du Qu√©bec).
So much pour une entreprise locale...
Moi je me demande si quelqu'un les a gliss√© frauduleusement dans nos cases postales? Je doute que Poste Canada a vraiment mis √ßa dans nos bo√Ætes? Aussi, pas fait √† main pantoute la copie que j'ai re√ßu. J'ai vers√© de l'eau dessus et moi c'√©tait une photocopie couleur üòÇ
I used to get ones like this back in Ontario before I moved here.
They're designed to look "hand-written", but anyone with two braincells to rub together can see that they aren't; there's no indentation in the paper where the words are 'written', the ink smears like inkjet printer ink, not ballpoint pen ink, and your neighbour gets one that is *identical.*
Anyone who goes through the trouble of masquerading like this is up to no good.
J‚Äôai re√ßu la m√™me lettre ici √† Vancouver. Mais la compagnie a un nom diff√©rent.

No doubt these scum also read the obituaries for the real estate opportunities.

Our real estate market is becoming a casino, and will continue to, as long as our GDP is tied to real estate. Canadian real estate is our primary export, so a fall in real estate prices will put us into a recession. It's currently near impossible to buy a house that gives positive rental income, meaning there's only two types of buyers left. Speculators, buying just to resell in a year or two, and people fearing this is their last chance to buy and spending too much money to lock in a place.
We need to fix zoning regulations before this gets out of control further than it already is, because it's going to be disaster when the real estate bubble party stops.

Got one of these too about a month ago except the one I got was a whole sob story about how the writers mom was dying and he needed to buy a home in the area to take care of her. Load of crap
Got the English version sent to my house last august in Ottawa lol

For the curious, there are [religious reasons](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=13922989) for washing your feet a few times a day so that's most likely what was going on here.
√áa avait √©t√© l'objet d'une plainte y'a une quinzaine d'ann√©es : https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/300415/ets-musulmans
c'est une chose religieuse (la plupart du temps, sinon tous les musulmans), le probl√®me avec cela, c'est qu'ils ne nettoient pas apr√®s eux-m√™mes, laissant donc de l'eau partout sur les comptoirs et le sol, de sorte que les gens passent et peuvent glisser et tomber.
Oui. Quand j'ai commenc√© √âTS en 2010 c'√©tait la m√™me affiche. C'√©tait d√ª √† une affaire religieuse me semble...
M√™me probl√®me a Sherbrooke. Les 2-3 qui faisaient ca laissaient un d√©g√¢t incroyable; le plancher inond√© et des t√¢ches d'eau sale jusqu'au plafond.

Vanier has a small one person washroom where you can do wudu and they have a small prayer room that's open to everyone.
Je sais qu'il y a des douches accessibles pour les √©tudiants.  Je n'y connais rien, mais c'est probablement plus appropri√© que les lavabos. 
L'ETS nous avait dit que l'interdiction √©tait pour des raisons de salubrit√©.
I went to school in the US at a university that had plenty of Muslims (although more Christians and Jews and secular people) and never encountered this issue in the washrooms there. Maybe it's because they had separate prayer spaces for religious people including Muslims to do their thing, without pushing them into the general washrooms? I don't think this is common in MTL but I'd love to be wrong. It's a good solution.
Not to be insensitive, but at Concordia one of the bathrooms was next to the muslim prayer center and people would use the sinks to wash their noses and feet. It was fucking disgusting, and washing my hands there made me feel dirtier than before.
This is a problem at Concordia too.
Un lavabo ce n'est pas fait pour se laver les pieds, ils peuvent le faire dans une douche ou un bain. Ce ne serait pas tr√®s compliqu√© d'installer quelques douches/bains individuels et demander aux musulmans d'aller s'y laver.
C'est d√©gueulasse les pieds dans le lavabo, ouach esti.
Just gonna chime in as a (shia) muslim, i am for the ban of washing feet in the sink. Sadly, this is something my sunni brothers and sisters can't seem to stop doing. When i was at Concordia, i saw once this student make a mess that i ended up cleaning after him. Please keep in mind not all of Islam is the same and that it can differ not only from branches of islam but also to different cultures. Thank you for your time.
Meanwhile, √† Concordia, tu peux chier dans l'urinoir si tu veux
Y‚Äôa s√ªrement des arabes qui l‚Äôont fais, car √† ma job yen avais un qui le faisais avant d‚Äôaller prier, il prenais litt√©ralement une douche dans le lavabo. Et ETS y‚Äôa plein de musulaman
Se laver les pieds dans le lavabo lol, cute.
Les vrais chad se lavent les pieds dans le bol de toilette.
yea this was a problem at Concordia, the muislim prayer room was on the same floor as one of the cafeterias and witnessing this regularly was pretty disgusting.
Je vais pas rentrer dans les d√©tails, mais √† mon taf un jour je suis entr√© dans des toilettes publiques et un mec faisait ses ablutions... en sa lavant les castagnettes.
Y'avait pas de panneau qui disait que c'√©tait interdit alors bon, c'est compliqu√©.
What about the armless kids?
Une hostie de chance qu'y soient pas oblig√©s de se laver la bizoune avant de prier, calisse...
Cest cultes la ont rien √† faire dans un lieux d'√©ducation vivement une vrai soci√©t√© la√Øc...
Jai vue des chose ben plus pire...
This is called common sense
This is absolutely disgusting and unacceptable. This is something that should be done at home IN PRIVATE
How many exposed feet had fungus touching the sink handles ? Next person that touches that handle is going to potentially find themselves with warts on their fingers.
Je veux savoir comment cela a √©t√© d√©couvert comme un probl√®me lol...
Pourquoi
Makes sense
C‚Äôest drole parce qu‚Äô√† concordia les musulmans ont une salle de priere ainsi qu‚Äôun petit lavabo pour faire l‚Äôablution. Peut-etre que l‚Äôets pourrait apprendre de quoi de concordia
Thank God Concordia made a small room for us to do wudhu. Some people don't clean up after doing it. 
I'm Muslim and this is definitely Muslim problem. Unfortunately, some don't clean up. 
However,  we should also go after people who don't wash their hands after answering nature's call. 
Personally, that's way more nasty than wishing your foot. At least, you're washing something as opposed to not washing and then you touch your phone and high five others üòÇ
Also, for a people who don't use bidets...making washing feet on a sink such a big issue....Priorities my 514 family. Priorities.
C'est quoi ce gaspillage d'eau pour se laver les pieds, prenez du purel viarge.
Muslims wash their feet. I‚Äôve caught a guy doing it a few times in a very public place
outrance.
They should just wash their feet in the toilet bowl. As someone who finds feet gross , better to keep this ‚Äú practice ‚Äú private. Also it‚Äôs less messy.
Old news bud, toutes les unis ont √ßa.  
BTW si tu vas dans les cages d'escaliers de pas mal tous les buildings en ville, tu vas trouver des tapis de pri√®re.
darn it! i was doing it every time I went to the restroom :(
This post really brought out the basement dwelling xenophobes and racists in this subreddit. As a muslim, I personally choose not to do it with water and in the bathroom as I could just as easily do Wudu with a rock (tayammum i believe its called) and seated at a chair in a corner of the cafeteria. It's true that it can seem a bit weird to some or even disgusting to others to do Wudu in a bathroom and those concerns are valid but bashing muslims and religion in general is just a bad take and I see a lot of that in the comments. 
A minimum of respect for people goes a long way, whether they believe in something or not

1- Salubrit√© : dude, c'est un lavabo, je me nettoie les pieds. C'est pas comme si y'avait de la pisse entre mes orteils. Aussi on est dans une toilette justement, on se touche tous le penis.... Combien d'entre vous se lavent pas les mains apr√®s votre ptit pipi?
2- priv√©/public : libart√© est mon contre argument. J'ai bien le droit de faire ma pri√®re dans le parc, dans un corridor vide, dans une salle de classe vide, dans le stationnement. Remplacez pri√®re par yoga... Messemble c'est pas mal absurde d'interdire les √©tirements/yoga dans les endroits publics. La raison pour laquelle je fais des mouvements sp√©cifiques ne regarde personne. je passe de debout √† agenouill√© une coupe de fois ya rien l√†
3- d√©g√¢ts : oui certains fr√®res et s≈ìurs malheureusement nessuient pas les comptoirs apr√®s avoir fais leurs ablutions. Mais c'est de l'eau... Pour avoir travaill√© dans un Tim Hortons et dans un best Buy, c'est beaucoup moins pire essuyer de l'eau que la mar√©e de marde et de pisse qui se ramasse sur les murs et par terre.
J'emmerde les racistes dans les commentsüëä
Damn you guys are mad at people cleaning themselves up, we can see the hate you have for Muslims.

Whats the harm if someone washes their feet in the sink? Is it important enough to ban the practice?
I'd have thought that the awkwardness of trying to wash your feet in a hand sink would be enough to deter all but the most determined and motivated...
The religious reason should also require them to clean up the mess they leave every time they wash their feet...  And don't even try to politely ask them to clean up their mess. At best they'll ignore you, at worst they'll yell at you.  Pleasant interactions, really...
A Muslim ritual called "wudu" is a tradition that involves washing one's hands, face and feet before prayers.
I wouldn't put reason and religious together.
Why is it still a mess if they wash them a few times a day? It should be only ceremonial if it's that often
Effectivement et c‚Äôest pourquoi ils ont ces lavabos bizarres qui ‚Äì para√Æt-il ‚Äì rend la t√¢che difficile.

Before all the politically nuanced and critical comments show up, hell ya! Go Habs Go!
C‚Äôest d√©bile √† quel point l‚Äôunivers du Qu√©bec tourne autour du Hockey. Je suis content pour les bars et les restaurateurs, mais ce sont des d√©cisions qui doivent √™tre prises √† l‚Äôaide de la science et non pas Phillip Danault.
√áa a pris le Canadien en s√©rie pour que les Qu√©b√©cois se rendent compte qu'on exag√®re en comparaison des Am√©ricains?
I'm a Hab fan, and have no no interest in going to bars to watch the games.
But that said, this is fine. If you're going to open the bars up, what difference does it make if they close at midnight or a couple hours later? Does the virus stop infecting people for a few hours before midnight?
These businesses have been struggling for over a year. If they're able to make money, then go for it.
I'd forgotten hockey even existed thanks to this past year.
So we get three nights? lol
Watch as cases continue to go down regardless of what changes because SURPRISE COVID we have vaccines now! It‚Äôs becoming funny to see all this political theater unfold. Legault must have realized he would piss off his base if he didn‚Äôt let people watch the game in bars because they would be closing due to his policies. What a ruckus.
We have less than 60 cases per day in Montreal. When are people finally going to stop whining and accept that it's about time we start going back to living normal lives. Like if this bothers you just stay home.
Mon legault a son public cible en esti: ok pour ouvrir et prendre une bi√®re en checkant la game, mais interdit au poteux de faire pousser sur leur terrains ou de vendre entre eux. 
HELLO BOOMER VOTE FOR LEGO OK THANKS BYE
This is the way
Don‚Äôt they know that there is a panoramic going on?!
I would think people would not go to drink after all the restrictions.
Funny how we look the other way in the name of freedom when it comes to our vices. It's worse than firearms but since not many if us have them, we like to shit on that often.

The government should never control business hours under any circumstance.If you don't like business that are open late, then don't shop there, and don't work there.  
EDIT: apparently people don't understand my point; The government can shut down a risky business if they want to, my contention is that they should have no control over business hours.
C‚Äôest l‚Äôepitome de ‚Äúdu pain et des jeux‚Äù.

>On ajoute seulement 1h pour que les gens puissent prendre une bi√®re pendant la 3e p√©riode.
apparamment 1 heure est TRES IMPORTANT quand on parle du couvrefeu de 9:30 a 8:30!!! oh OUI SUPER IMPORTANT!!! mais 1 heure de plus pour la game... ah c'est un petit bonbon.... 
choisis! you can't tell me that 1 hour earlier for curfew is required because we need to limit the spread of COVID and then turn around and push 1 hour back for hockey when they winning the cup... 
this just shows me that the government doesn't have our best interest and only do shit that suits them.
Si j'ai compris quelque chose dans la derni√®res ann√©e, c'est que certaines personnes ont maintenant beaucoup trop de temps pour chialer sur tout.
La limite d'heure mise en place est d√©j√† sp√©culative et son but est d'√©viter  les abus plus qu'autres choses, donc √ßa ne change pas √©norm√©ment de choses de servir de l'alcohol jusqu'√† minuit au lieu de 23h. La majorit√© des gens vont rester dans les bars jusqu'√† la fin du match anyways, la seule diff√©rence est qu'au lieu de se commander plus de drinks au last call pour 23h, ils vont s'en commander un dernier a celui de minuit.
C'est pas comme si les bars √©taients ferm√©s tout les autres jours et ouvrait sp√©cialement pour les soir√©es de hockeys, de plus ils ont toujours les quotas de capacit√©s r√©duites a 50% a respecter ainsi qu'une liste de mesures sanitaires a suivre.
naeh man
c'est qoui cette attitude paternaliste du gouvernement, aucun chiffre justifie la fermeture de bars.... a 2am..et la vente de l'alcool... a 12...
Dans pas long on va avoir des restrictions sur la masturbation et quand, comment et avec qui  faire l'amour?
On est pas dans une √©poque victorien ou pendant la prohibition
C'est l'absurdit√© de la chose qui d√©range. absolument rien ne d√©montre que le couvre-feu soit utile √† quoi que ce soit, √ßa fait des mois que toutes ces mesures auraient d√ª √™tre enlev√©s. mais la, vu que √ßa d√©range les fans du canadien, l√† c'est une urgence nationale d'enlever des mesures !?!?!? Qui mange de la marde le tabarnak...

J'allais justement poster le m√™me article.
Je peux comprendre la r√©ticence conc√©dant la demande pour plus de partisant(e)s mais garder les bars ouvert une ou deux heures de plus ne devrait causer de probl√®me that que les mesures sanitaires sont respect√©s.  √âvidement √ßa devient un peu plus difficile √† g√©rer pour les √©tablissements, mais faut aussi commencer √† leur faire confiance
Jte dirais que si on regarde le pourcentage de morts et de cas, j'ai mieux aim√© notre strat√©gie que la leur.

we're on tail end *because* we aren't giving up and pretending it's already over. I'm actually happy with this announcement and I'm fine with loosening up restrictions as the majority of the population has their first dose, but there's no reason to throw everything away now.

How cringe when someone uses the term SJW. I threw up in my mouth a little.
We are currently living in a world gripped by a pandemic and are only now beginning to actually refain some control over the situation...

Great photo OP, looks just like I remember it 30 years ago.
down looking up
look at the angle of the lightbulbs
I suspect that the crowd of people on the right indicate a train that has just discharged a group. Also the angle of the person closest to us would be very strange if we were looking up. Therefore I think we are looking down. But it's really hard to tell and I am less than certain.
Stairs?
Trick question, those stairs are straight.
Very nice reflections on that pic

J‚Äôavoue avoir √©t√© moi-m√™me perturb√© le soir quand je l‚Äôai revue, mais oui, je te confirme que je montais vers la sortie üôÇ
Ah mais attend, je pensais que tu disais que c'etai plat (comme par exemple √† l'a√©roport), que √ßa ne monte ou descend pas du tout, c'est √ßa que j'entend par un tapis roulant. Mais l√† je crois que tu veux dire qu'il n'y a pas de marches, mais √ßa monte/descend quandm√™me, et ok je suis capable de voir que √ßa monte √† gauche.
Pour redonner un minimum d'espoir aux gens, mardi soir je suis all√© √† l'urgence avec une amie. Elle faisait une r√©action allergique aux arachides (en plus de se remettre d'une fracture du bassin, la chance). Elle a √©t√© prise en charge hyper rapidement malgr√© qu'elle n'avait pas de difficult√© √† respirer. En moins de 5 minutes elle √©tait en salle de choc. Observation 3h, retour avec la doc et cong√© de l'h√¥pital. Facture de 0$.
Un gros merci au staff de l'h√¥pital Jean-Talon, vous avez √©t√© merveilleux.
Je te souhaite de pouvoir voir un doc rapidement, on se croise les doigts.

If you're dying, our system is great. If you're only slowly dying...we need a much better system.
I work in healthcare and I endorse this message.
I went to CLSC for depression/anxiety. Got a call a year and a half later.  Thanks I guess.
Thankfully , I had shingles a bit after I went to the CLSC and went to ER cause we wernt sure what it was. my mom talked about my mental health to the doctor there and had an appointment in the same week in her clinic.
Clinics "without appointment" but you need to take an appointment between 7pm and 7h02pm the day before. Otherwise its booked
I can't relate to this at all. I have been in and around the system a lot in the past two years and I was quite sick at one point. Even spent two one week periods in the hospital. I have found the opposite. I have had everything from CT scans(with and without contrast) and ultrasound to  echocardiograms and regular blood tests without an issue. My GP, specialists, Nurses at infusion visits, orderlies and transport people,  everyone has taken incredible care of me.
In May, I was trying to find a spot for a blood work at CLSC but no appointment left prior July in my area. I ended up going private, spent 200$ that my insurance covered and there was no appointment needed, doc had the results the following day. I am very sad to say it but the health system is dead in Quebec and for quite a while.
I needed a referral to three different specialists from my GP. Got an appointment with him after 4 months, and I am lucky to even have a GP. Not a single number he gave me is correct. Two places said they were closed indefinitely for COVID, and the third was literally some chick's cell in Laval. I actually left a message asking and she called back saying she gets calls asking for that doctor daily. And now my GP's office won't pick up at all and I have no idea how to get a replacement referral.
Sorry this is happening to you. I've had the opposite experience, but I know I got lucky. 
Normally tests are fast but even blood work right now is weeks to get an appointment, since Covid. 
The hospital you are at really matters. CHUM is really good IME. Lots of tech making things quite quick once there. Others look like from the 80s. 
If you really think you're in a bad way, go to the ER. Of course you'll wait unless actual emergency (eg ambulance) so be prepared and maybe go late night/ early AM. The attending there can order certain tests, and thereafter refer you to the appropriate specialist. Usually they refer to within their hospital system. You doctor more likely refers to whatever they're part of/ have medical privileges at.
I moved from Montreal about 4 years ago because I'm an English speaker with chronic illness. Living in BC is expensive but at least I can see a dr and get hooked up when I need it, sort of. BC sucks too, I blame Stephen Harper for Canada's laughable universal health care. Like teeth and eyes are crucial to your health, but nOoOoo, for some reason they're not included.
Vieille histoire qui date de ~2004; 
Accident de skate et mon bras fait vraiment mal. Le lendemain ca fait encore plus mal donc go a la clinique passer des rayons-X tot le matin. Le m√©decin me dit que mon bras est cass√©. C'est une petite fracture mais j'ai besoin d'un pl√¢tre et il m'envoie √† l'h√¥pital pour ca. Donc apres 3h √† la clinique je vais direct √† l'h√¥pital ou je dois attendre √† l'urgence. 11 heures plus tard, le m√©decin me voit dans un bureau type triage, regarde mes radios, claque son crayon un peu sur l'√©cran et me dit apr√®s 20 secondes; "Ouin t'as une petite fracture mais on met plus de pl√¢tre pour ca. Garde ton bras en √©charpe et retourne chez toi."
The problem with the health care system is that there are as many pencil pushers as there are health care professionals 
There‚Äôs so much red tape in the system that nothing ever gets done 
My 2 brothers are doctors and would never practice here
Really sucks you've had a bad experience.
Personally, I've always had an alright time using the system. Normally if I need to be seen I can do it the same day or the next day and usually have minimal waiting periods- but that's just me and I don't have a chronic illness or anything that demands I use it ever week or anything.
What I find a bigger problem is actual hospital conditions. Any time one of my family members has gone to the Charles-Lemoyne on the south shore we have had huge problems with miscommunication and neglect. My grandma went in for a hip surgery and ended up dying there of COVID related complications (she didn't have COVID before going in). She kept telling my relatives how bad it was, that they weren't taking care of her and even the social worker said the hospital was verging on neglect.
Quite a while before that my other grandma had horrible problems there too- she doesn't speak french well so the staff just wasn't telling her anything. Because of the medication coupled with their bad treatment, she spiralled downward until my family intervened and demanded answers and then suddenly everything seemed to get magically better.
If you are ever on the South Shore and have a choice in the matter, please go to Pierre Boucher and not the Charles Lemoyne- it's a death trap. I'm convinced their idea of taking care of the elderly is just letting them die.
Yeah it's absolutely horrible. People pay 50% taxes and still get zero service except police to give them speeding tickets.
Sorry this has been your experience.
I accompanied a friend going through cancer treatments in the last couple of years.
Not at all the experience he had.  Aside from one or two grouchy hospital staff, the rest was excellent service, at no cost. Yes, there is bureaucracy but it's not that bad once your file is open in the hospital and you have recurring appointments.
OP, I totally feel you there. You're not alone. Been in line for a family doctor for 7 years, RIEN! 
Walk in clinics are by appointment only, and while others on here may claim theirs are walk-in, I have called over 40 clinics recently and they do not take appointments unless you have a family doctor at that exact clinic. In other words, it's a catch 22. 
At this point, I am travelling back to Europe to get to a doctor. I have given up here. F**k Quebec's healthcare!!!! 
P.S. having lived here for a decade, I am yet to understand why Canadians are so proud of their healthcare. Just because it might be cheaper than the states doesn't make it great. Use any other developed country as a reference and the picture becomes clear.
Basic health is pretty bad but mental health is even worse
Can we just talk about the lack of modernization? I had to send a FAX to get a pap smear. I then called the place to ask if they got my FAX. The first thing the recording said was "please send a fax to us for all inquiries" and hung up. I received a call back 8 months later from "unknown name". Luckily I didn't ignore the call (I figured it was some chinese robocall).
Then I needed to find a specialist for dementia for my parents. No luck. Called 811, they asked me so many questions, refused to speak English, then after 30 mins wait, 30 mins of answering questions, they said "you're in luck I have a place for you". They tell me to write a number down and get this.. it was just the basic number for a very basic walk in clinic near where my parents live. Gee.. thanks! Not.
So, I call the basic clinic and they say "oh sorry no appointments can be made as we're full". I said "oh, you're full for the week? Month?" she replies "no, we're full for the day". I said "OK that's fine put us down for tomorrow". She says "oh no! You have to call the same day at 7am. Usually we fill up soon so call early". I call at 7am, no answer. Same thing for 7:30, etc.. It took days to finally get an appointment. I get to the appointment, 1 hour wait. Then, the doctor does the most basic test you could find off the internet and then says we need blood tests. I say "ok great, draw the blood please". He said OH NO, you have to go to a hospital or CLSC or you can go to the Walmart down the street but there is a fee for that. Etc.. I've lived outside of Quebec and most clinics will test your blood the same day in the same clinic or they will refer you to a blood testing clinic very nearby with a very convenient way to set up an appointment online. Going to a CLSC or Hospital is very extreme just to get a blood test. These places are flooded with people, and are walk in only which means more pointless inconvenient wait times. So, I guess I have to go to a Walmart pharmacy, with no online booking system of course,  and pay for a blood test because we have free healthcare.
I have so many examples. Another one is I needed to go to the ER. I go to the General Hospital. My sister calls me and tells me she knows a nurse at the Jewish General and the nurse will "get me ahead". So, I go to the Jewish, there are people crying in pain, they call me up like VIP (I just had hemmorid). I saw a doctor within 30 minutes because "I knew someone". CORRPUT!!! Apparently its' common to get ahead of the line because you know someone. I never used this "trick" again as it's so corrupt. I didn't think it would actually work.
Faxes, weird "bonjour sante" website you have to pay for.
On the positive side.. Sainte Justine is an amazing AMAZING hospital but it ain't easy to get into and you better know how to speak French and I think it's only for women and children.
I think a lot of people put themselves and can't remove themselves from situations like this.
It doesn't mean you had a great experience that the system is great. That's akin to saying that poverty isn't a thing because you live in a palace and you're old money rich.
It doesn't mean you had the worst experience that your POV is true either.
There are some measures that are more objective, but even that is averages which is not always useful.
Fyi, when I criticize a system, it's really the system, never the humans working hard for us.
You can look at OECD medical system rankings, you can look at hospital wait times (emergency vs non emergency), you can look at how we deal with life threatening injuries.
We all have personal experiences with the system. For example, I have had undignified, inhumane experiences that gave me years long trauma, as well as some nice experience. All the bad experience was due to terrible organization and logistics mix ups as well as the lack of bedside manner of doctors whereas all the nice experience was simple kindness of some nurses who knew to hold my hand when I needed it.
I do think the "sans rendez vous" that actually requires a rendez vous is pure bullshit, and something I have not seen in the 4 countries I lived in and the dozens of cities worldwide I have visited. The best experience in terms of system efficiency (and not how nice someone is) was South Korea. The reason why was that every system is digitized. No faxes. You take appointments online, you email your doctors and so on.
I also agree that if you are dying or near death, they will treat you. Without being ungrateful for the peace and system we get to live in, let's not forget that medical doctors take a vow/pledge to save lives. It is their "devoir". 
The question you want to ask yourself is - is the minimum enough? What are we allowed to expect as citizens of a developed nation? Before saying our system is great, how aware are you of other systems? 
Avoiding complacency or being simplement content is healthy in this case.
I know healthcare is expensive. Every piece of medical equipment costs a fortune. Our healthcare is "free" but its a huge chunk of our taxes. There are austerity cuts every four years.
I am someone who wants more. I don't want hospital parkings to cost a fortune for visiting families (my experience at the JGH), I don't want patients to pay for TV, I want nurses to be paid fairly, I don't want patients to have to deal with cold and inhumane attitudes, I want medical scribes to help doctors reduce time between seeing patients,  I want our expectations for our system to be more than the minimum. For the staff and for patients alike. 
I'll take our system becoming digitized and modernized though, if we can't have anything else. The fax system is ridiculous and we should be ashamed that our province is so reliant on it, when many other developed nations have solutions.
I apologize for my ramblings.
Ppl keep talking shit about India. I know a buddy in Montreal who's from there and he was telling me about his experience. For $40 CAD, you could get a phlebotomist to *come* to your house, take a full range of blood samples (no Doc prescription required) and have the results processed online the next day. Here, you have to wade through miles of red tape to do something simple like that.
And you can see by the other responses ("just go to the ER if you need it that badly"), people don't really take any sort of preventive, proactive health measures seriously. When you read about people in Montr√©al waiting weeks to get some essential blood work done, you realize that you're in a different and sucky reality.
ITT : People who've never lived in other provinces thinking we have a great system here.
Left after 14 hours waiting in the emergency room with  intense kidney pain. 
Drove to the townships and got in in under 2 hours.
I was in the ER waiting for 16 hours the other night... there were people who had been waiting longer than me. Why do we permit this state of affairs?
**You have to cut in line using using private care in Montreal, for early diagnosis, or you're fucked.** Otherwise have fun getting gaslit by people who don't even answer the phone.
People who think private health care is immoral are free to wait 14 hours at Maisonneuve Rosemont.
The government intentionally sends doctors home at night so that they can keep the wait times to 14 hours. Otherwise, if they hired more staff, you could get seen quicker at 2am, and that would be unacceptable, they wouldn't be able to save money. Meanwhile, taxpayers are paying for heating & maintenance of a building no one uses because there's no staff.
5 people I know paid 200$ to see a private dermatologist, for very minor but time-sensitive painful issues. Because the waitlist was too long in public system , ridiculous.
That's what 12 years of the most corrupt party being in power  since Duplessis will do.
Couillard actually overlapped two jobs for a while: minister of health and executive at a private medecine conglomerate...
J'attendais un appel du d√©partement de gastroenterology suite √† un rendez-vous √† l'hopital CUSM. Quelque chose d'assez s√©rieux. Le docteur m'a clairement dit, le d√©partement va vous appeler. 6 mois plus tard, toujours pas d'appel. Je rappelle au CUSM pour leur demander des nouvelles de mon dossier, pour me faire dire que mon dossier a √©t√© transf√©r√© √† l'hopital Ste Marie en gastroenterology. Depuis ca, j'ai appel√© 5 fois √† l'hopital Ste-Marie, laiss√© 3 messages, et on ne m'a jamais rappel√©.
De plus, mois pass√©, j'appel √† ma clinique pour prendre rendez-vous, on m'annonce que mon m√©decin de famille (qui √©tais en vacances depuis genre 3 mois) a chang√© de clinique et que je n'ai maintenant plus de m√©decin de famille.
C'est tr√®s difficile, pas juste √† Montr√©al, mais au Qu√©bec.
Wait, OQLF are not doctors? Didn't they get some funding even during the pandemic? I thought that would have improved the health system.
Sorry my bad.
In some areas it's terrible, my grandmother has shit times at GPs. But a family member needs a surgery and is getting one in the next month and a bit where you see other places it's more that 5 months.  I think the entirety is not terrible but some aspects are disgusting.
You new here? It‚Äôs been like that since as far back as I can remember, which is 1987. Any scan takes months and months of waiting. Getting to see a specialist is months of waiting. Going to the ER is 12+ hours of waiting. 
Now with the corona, it‚Äôs even worst. They do that on purpose mind you. They want our Medicare system to be so frustrating that we accept privatized Medicare. It‚Äôs the end goal of these bastards. 
They want to make it like it is in the states. So they make ours frustrating beyond belief, hoping we‚Äôll all beg to go private. 
Trust me, that would be very very bad. Just like most Canadians can‚Äôt afford to go to the dentist unless it‚Äôs an emergency, with private Medicare you‚Äôd have the same thing. 
We need Medicare reform. Just make sure you never vote for private Medicare.
J'ai pass√© une r√©sonance magn√©tique o√π le m√©decin s'est inqui√©t√© pour ma rate. √áa a pris 3 ans pour arriver au diagnostic de "votre rate est ok, elle est juste bizarre". Smh
Come to gatineau, you will love healthcare in Montreal after that
Helps if you have family or friends that are relentless and persistent to get your call or rendez vous , but all is now online only, and even those have queues and loopholes. hint: search for remote postal codes, that may (or may not) get you in sooner.
we are all but a number now in the grand scheme of things. welcome to the new world order, where our souls themselves are now part of the big blockchain technology perpatrated by Bitcoin, uber, and IoT. Absolutely all social services got strained to epic proportions prior the pandemic (something had to give, oh snap) , but don't despair. even my spouse that is a rockstar at health related needs, is finding dead ends in the system, just keep at it. again, get a friend or family member(s) or hire someone as contract, that can help get your calls back to you from online appts. or walk in cliinics if that is still your thing. Our population is busting at the seams, and whether our GOV used Covid or not as the new social order of things, this is the new normal. we are still in for a bumpy ride. take care of yourselves everyone.
¬´¬†Better crooks than separatists¬†¬ª
Yup that's how it works get an appointment for 4-6 months unless it will be an emergency and almost too late.
it goes something like this, you will get what we give you and shut up or you could pay full price out of pocket or get gouged by private insurance and go into bankruptcy, that's basically how our system works and the only reason why that is acceptable is because of the united states, the only developed country in the world that doesn't offer universal healthcare to its citizens.
And if the corporations had their way they would 100% privatize our healthcare system, the insurance companies already got the province to force employers to put their employees on private health insurance and they're always lobbying to take away more and more of our rights little by little and most doctors are only interested in getting paid so they're not going to fight the system.
I wasted 5 hours of my day waiting to see a doc today and it was fking trash I didn‚Äôt see nobody I fed up and left. The staff at the reception are fking retard and play with ppl.
Also, sky is blue ad water is wet.
Te pandemic fucked everything up. Go to the emergencies.
My wife has been going to doctors for 4 years with chronic gut and back pain. We went to several specialists and many different hospitals and clinics. Still no diagnosis or solutions presented.
We‚Äôve basically been doing our own research and figured out enough to solve the issue on our own. I don‚Äôt want to think what‚Äôs going to happen when we can‚Äôt keep the pain at bay with diet, vitamins, and exercise. I feel like we‚Äôll just go back to the hopeless circus of useless and repeating tests they had her doing again.
So sorry you have to live this. They really did screw up the system, should be redone from its very foundations‚Ä¶ Unfortunately we probably don‚Äôt have anyone competent enough to do it right (especially at the Minist√®re‚Ä¶)
if i need to see a doctor, i go private and my work insurance pays for it.
The only saving grace here in Quebec is the pharmacare.
OP knows ‚Äúso many people that are critically ill‚Äù
Broke my finger . ET send me to clinic the next day. Nurse there somehow put the splint maybe after watching YouTube videos since they did not have anyone who was experienced with finger fracture . Clinic again referred me to the same hospital to a plastic specialist but the earliest appointment i could have was after 4 weeks. The response of specialist after three weeks " your finger is healing but the bone was not set properly and is fixing itself in a wrong way, If we try to break it again and try to fix it by surgery it may mess it up more". So in short I have a semi mobile slightly bent finger for life with high chances of Arthritis when (and if) I get old.
The golden advice my good specialist (no sarcasm here) to me to scream in ET even I am there for mild sneezing. Its the only way to get a faster treatment right at the hospital.
>make appointments once every blue fkn moon.
That's not how it works. You can make appointments daily but you can't visit the site at any time of day. You have to do so at hourly intervals each clinic updates the site at the end of the day at different hourly intervals and you can only expect them to stay listed for a max of 30 min. Start checking at 5:00 pm, then 6:00 pm, then 7:00 pm, then 8:00 pm. 
FYI it's easier to find appointments with https://www.bonjour-sante.ca than the government's site of https://rvsq.gouv.qc.ca different clinics use one or the other.
Yes they are absolute shit at informing people of this wacky need to check at hourly intervals. But the system is actually fairly functional once I learned to use it and got me serviced quickly. New appointment slots are listed daily.
Yep, c'est pour ca que j'ai fini par payer pour aller au priv√©. Si j'avais attendu apr√®s le syst√®me public j'aurais d√©velopp√© des probl√®mes chroniques. 4 ans a attendre un m√©decin de famille au public, et le reste du syst√®me de sant√© t'es bloqu√© si t'a pas de m√©decin de famille pour te faire des r√©f√©rence. A oui et mon b√©b√© qui avait besoin d'une consultation dans une sp√©cialit√© p√©diatrique, on a pris des rendez-vous partout, on nous a rappel√© **2 ANS** apr√®s avoir demand√© le rendez-vous.
C'est aussi pour ca que je d√©m√©nage aux USA l'an prochain... tant qu'a payer public ET priv√©, j'aime mieux payer juste priv√©.
Call 811 and play the innocent idiot theyll get you an appointment in 24hrs
Was shit even before the pandemic. I was supposed to get shoulder surgery. Got the x-rays and MRI. Had an appointment at 10am to consult with the doctor to see what was next. Waited 3 hours before I left. And don't you dare ask the nurse at reception ANYTHING. They'll just point at the sign that says "don't harass employees..."
Speaking of which, if a place has to post a sign telling people not to attack the staff - they're probably doing a shit job running the place.
It gets better when you get a family doctor.

C‚Äôest une rue avec des commerces et des restaurants, c‚Äôest pas le Mont Royal non plus hein
Texte de l‚Äôarticle si vous avez d√©j√† eu vos 4 articles gratuits du mois :P
‚Äî-
L‚Äôachat de plusieurs b√¢timents historiques au c≈ìur du Quartier chinois de Montr√©al par un promoteur immobilier inqui√®te des citoyens, qui r√©clament un statut de site patrimonial pour le secteur au m√™me titre que le Vieux-Montr√©al.
Au coin des rues De La Gaucheti√®re et C√¥t√©, derri√®re le Palais des congr√®s, se dresse l‚Äôancien b√¢timent de la British and Canadian School, con√ßu en 1826, abritant le fabricant de nouilles et de biscuits orientaux Wing, en activit√© depuis plus de 100¬†ans. Juste √† c√¥t√© se trouve un imposant immeuble int√©grant une partie de l‚Äô√©glise Free Presbyterian, construite en 1848.
Nouilles Wing a vendu ces deux b√¢timents en mars aux promoteurs Brandon Shiller et Jeremy Kornbluth, de Hillpark Capital, pour 9,2¬†millions de dollars. Ce sont des hommes d‚Äôaffaires qui ont r√©cemment fait les manchettes, √©tant accus√©s de tenter d‚Äôexpulser les locataires du Manoir Lafontaine, dans le Plateau-Mont-Royal. Le Groupe de travail sur le Quartier chinois s‚Äôest alors mobilis√©, a rapport√© lundi le quotidien Montreal Gazette.
¬´¬†C‚Äôest un choc. On pensait que Wing serait l√† pour toujours ou serait le dernier √† quitter le quartier, car l‚Äôentreprise est l√† depuis toujours¬†¬ª, commente Donny Seto, membre du Groupe.
Pour le moment, l‚Äôentreprise de nouilles est devenue locataire des lieux et continue ses activit√©s. Mais le Groupe, qui r√©unit des citoyens ayant √† c≈ìur le d√©veloppement social du secteur, a bien l‚Äôimpression que les promoteurs ont d‚Äôautres plans. En d√©but d‚Äôann√©e, ils ont acquis plusieurs autres adresses rue De La Gaucheti√®re, dont une ancienne √©cole chinoise datant du XIXe¬†si√®cle, et des stationnements. Leur entit√© d‚Äôaffaires se nomme Investissements 1000 Saint-Urbain.
¬´¬†Il semble y avoir une volont√© de fusionner ces lots pour en faire un grand projet¬†¬ª, juge Jonathan Cha, membre fondateur du Groupe de travail.
Jean-Philippe Riopel habite depuis 11¬†ans dans l‚Äôun des immeubles nouvellement acquis par Investissements 1000 Saint-Urbain. C‚Äôest lui qui a alert√© le Groupe lorsqu‚Äôil a pris connaissance de ces ventes. Celui qui est guide touristique dans le quartier n‚Äôa pas re√ßu d‚Äôavis d‚Äôexpulsion pour le moment. Toutefois, les deux autres locataires de l‚Äôimmeuble ont quitt√© les lieux peu avant et apr√®s l‚Äôacquisition par le nouveau propri√©taire.
M.¬†Riopel, M.¬†Cha et M.¬†Seto craignent que des immeubles patrimoniaux soient d√©truits pour y construire des appartements en copropri√©t√©. M.¬†Seto fait remarquer que plusieurs projets de tours de ce genre sont en cours le long de l‚Äôavenue Viger. ¬´¬†S‚Äôils mettent des immeubles √† vingt √©tages √† la place des b√¢timents les plus historiques du quartier, √ßa va d√©truire Chinatown¬†¬ª, estiment-ils.
De son c√¥t√©, Hillpark Capital indique qu‚Äô¬´¬†il n‚Äôy a √† l‚Äôheure actuelle aucun projet officiel de planifi√© et tout projet potentiel futur prendrait fortement en consid√©ration la tr√®s riche histoire du voisinage environnant et mettrait de l‚Äôavant, de mani√®re sensible, la pr√©servation du patrimoine architectural des √©difices existants¬†¬ª.
Le directeur des politiques d‚ÄôH√©ritage Montr√©al, Dinu Bumbaru, souligne qu‚Äôil s‚Äôagit d‚Äôun des plus vieux quartiers de Montr√©al, o√π se trouvent des fondations datant de l‚Äô√©poque du r√©gime fran√ßais. Des communaut√©s anglaises, √©cossaises et juives l‚Äôont ensuite occup√© avant les Chinois. Or, des m√©gaprojets comme le Complexe Guy-Favreau en ont d√©j√† d√©truit une partie. Le secteur fait partie de l‚Äôaire de protection de l‚Äô√âglise de la Mission-Catholique-Chinoise-du-Saint-Esprit, for√ßant tout projet de d√©molition √† obtenir l‚Äôapprobation de la ministre de la Culture. Le Groupe de travail sur le Quartier chinois souligne qu‚Äôune reconnaissance provinciale comme site patrimonial permettrait d‚Äôy contr√¥ler davantage tout d√©veloppement.

Malheureusement m√™me la je penses que c'est trop tard, le quartier √† tellement chang√© avec tout ces condos que ce n'est plus ce que c'√©tait.
New developments in Chinatown must align with the fact that Chinatown must stay as Chinatown. Community groups and residents will have a necessary voice in the approval of new developments. Funds will become available for maintenance. Etc etc

Ah oui, brandon shiller la coquerelle de l'immobilier au Qu√©bec. C'est s√ªr que y va tout ruiner
Oh shit I hadn't realised it was Shiller behind the sales too, they're going to turn these into overpriced basic condos that have no relation to the area at all.   
Chinatown needs a big help, and a big boost, there's so much potential, but these are not the guys to do it. A lot of buildings in the area need renovations, but there is a lot of foot traffic, and so many businesses around. Specialty eaters, local markets and crafts, could all benefit the area.

Au-del√† du cadre b√¢ti, le Groupe estime qu‚Äôun embourgeoisement pourrait avoir des effets d√©l√©t√®res sur la communaut√© chinoise. L‚Äôacc√®s au logement y est d√©j√† tr√®s limit√©, affirme Jonathan Cha, et une pression des loyers √† la hausse pourrait pousser les r√©sidents actuels vers la sortie. ¬´¬†Il faut s‚Äôassurer qu‚Äôil y a une population chinoise qui pourra y demeurer et qu‚Äôil y a suffisamment de locaux pour des fonctions sociales, communautaires, culturelles et religieuses¬†¬ª, plaide M.¬†Cha. Sans cela, il craint que le Quartier chinois devienne un quartier touristique sans √¢me.
Robert Beaudry, conseiller de ville dans Ville-Marie, partage les inqui√©tudes des citoyens. ¬´¬†Quand on regarde ce qui s‚Äôest pass√© sur l‚Äôavenue Papineau ou dans d‚Äôautres b√¢timents commerciaux du Mile End, on voit que ce sont des propri√©taires qui ont des strat√©gies parfois tr√®s douteuses qui am√®nent √† sortir des gens qui sont l√† depuis tr√®s longtemps et qui d√©structurent beaucoup les quartiers¬†¬ª, indique celui qui est aussi responsable de l‚ÄôHabitation au comit√© ex√©cutif. Il souligne qu‚Äôun plan d‚Äôaction pour redynamiser le Quartier chinois sera bient√¥t rendu public, √©labor√© avec de nombreux partenaires de la communaut√©.
La Ville utilisera tous les outils √† sa disposition pour y assurer un d√©veloppement ad√©quat, affirme M.¬†Beaudry. ¬´¬†C‚Äôest le seul quartier chinois francophone en Am√©rique du Nord. On veut le magnifier, pas le d√©cimer¬†¬ª, d√©clare-t-il.
La ministre de la Culture et des Communications, Nathalie Roy, se dit pour sa part ¬´¬†sensible au caract√®re sp√©cifique du Quartier chinois¬†¬ª. ¬´¬†Pr√©cisons que quiconque peut faire une demande de classement aupr√®s du minist√®re de la Culture et des Communications. Cette demande sera ensuite analys√©e en regard des valeurs patrimoniales d√©finies dans la Loi sur le patrimoine culturel¬†¬ª, a indiqu√© par courriel l‚Äôattach√© de presse de son cabinet, Louis-Julien Dufresne.

On parle pas du gouvernement Chinois ici, mais bien de sino-qu√©b√©cois
I feel the same way, however I would still be in favour of saving the neighborhood just because it's very likely the new owners will not make good use of the land.
Second that. As a bonus, it helps a bit to combat the chinese government to support free chinese districts.
Merci d'avoir fait le distinction. C'est appr√©ci√©.
> Many of Didulo‚Äôs followers seem to believe she‚Äôs holding tribunals behind the scenes, which are resulting in the executions they‚Äôre thirsting for. These followers use extremely tenuous scraps of evidence to prove Didulo is actually in power‚Äîincluding the fact that Romana Didulo is an anagram for ‚ÄúI Am Our Donald.‚Äù

Honestly, I spend plenty of time on conspiracy sites and I've never heard of Romana Didulo so perhaps I'm reading the "wrong" conspiracy sites.
I've seen my share of conspiracy theories, and though I don't agree with them, many groups at least try to make their claims sound serious/credible. But this "letter" sounds like either a parody or some gibberish an elementary school child  would write, especially that "Je, Romana Didulo"... paragraph in the middle. I cannot believe grown-ups with a normal IQ and normal mental state would seriously put something like this together. It has to be some joke.
Mettons qu'elle serait reine du canada et pas des folles, elle cite le common law et pas le droit civil alors √ßa vaudrait fuckall au qu√©bec son affaire.
The Didulo thing is pretty much a cult a this point.
Ah ben tabarnouche
The sad thing is that these people think they're helping, when honestly they need therapy or medication.  Mental healthcare workers need to be responding and intervening in these situations and maybe get these people some help.
It's easy to just call them assholes, but that's not what's happening.  They're scared, disoriented, and have lost their minds.
Romana Didulo= I Am Our Donald
Wow! Did they get a new strain at SQDC? Holy molly she must be smoking high grade stuff. That‚Äôs some next level s**t for Canada.
Is being a cult leader the next big trend after Instagram and tiktok influencers or something?
Dang I thought we only had them in the USA. I'm gonna feel right at home seeing these creeps after I move to Montreal lol :(
At what point could it be considered as a threat or an incentive to act violently towards healthcare people from her followers perspective ?
The part where she talked about putting bullets in health workers' head is very disturbing.
The sheer delusional stupidity donald trump has brought out of people is absolutely fucking *INSANE.*
Wait until Queen Elizabeth hears about this. She's gonna pay a little visit to queen Romana and open a can of whoop-ass on that qanon skank. There's only one Queen in Canada!

First of all, apologies for not writing this comment in French. I'm not a French speaker but I will definitely learn it as a language as soon as learning centres open up (don't want to study online).
I visited Montreal last month and spent a long weekend there. The city was amazing, beautiful, and worthy of a second, longer visit (most likely when things are getting back to normal so I can eat in, enjoy the night life).
Really enjoyed walking down Old Montreal and Old Port in one of the evenings. It felt like I went back in time to Europe.
PS: I would love to have some company on my next visit.
Edit: holy, wow! Thank you for a silver award, u/Zatlags.

Si vous montez les petites marches vous verrez au sol une plaque qui souligne la grande paix de Montr√©al de 1701 entre les fran√ßais et les premi√®res nations. Kondiaronk (nom donn√© au belv√©d√®re sur le Mont-Royal) a men√© plusieurs tribus (39) √† signer cette alliance devant le gouverneur Louis-Hector de Calli√®res mettant fin aux guerres qui faisaient rage lors des ann√©es pr√©c√©dentes.
Au sol vous pourrez observer les r√©pliques de diff√©rentes signatures des nations signataires.
One of my favourite areas of the city. Right behind this building, on St Paul, is a plaque marking the Place Du March√©, which was Montreal‚Äôs first public square in 1657.
Isn't this the old customs house?
What do you think the rent is at this place? Like $500-600 per month?
L'endroit o√π j'ai eu mon premier ticket ü•∞
Always wondered if we can visit inside some of these buildings in old Port.
There‚Äôs no need to apologize. Plenty of languages live here. I would hope no one takes offense.
Where were you visiting from?
Happy you liked it
You'll enjoy even more the next months when it'll finally be warm and when less litter will be in our streets üòâ
Just so you know "the sub is **bilingual**. Use French or English at your discretion" so no need to apologize! Also nice pic!
C'est un √©v√®nement vraiment sous-estim√©, des chefs de nations aussi lointaines que la Floride sont venus!
Thank you for the comment. I will definitely check it out on my next visit.
Interesting. What other places would you recommend i visit on my next trip? 
I didn't particularly see specific places in Old Montreal because I just wanted to walk around and experience the neighborhood instead of researching beforehand. But I understand that it's a surefire way of missing out on potentially amazing places.
But next time around, I would like to do both - walk around randomly AND have a list of places to see.
Yep. I couldn't explore the neighborhood in great detail though. Something to look forward to on my next visit.
Exact
Sorry for the reply in English. I didn't want to do a copy-paste from Google Translate.
Sorry that you got your ticket here. But, hey, they say first time is always memorable. So it is quite a neighborhood to get your first ticket in. üòä
La vieille douane est dans le vieux Montr√©al mais dans le vieux port tu peux visiter la tour de l'horloge, le centre des sciences, le grand quai, etc.
Thank you. Nobody took offense, neither here nor when I was in Montreal.
I visited from Toronto.
Enough to consider moving here permanently.
I'm definitely waiting for summer. More activities and less covid restrictions üòÄ
Thank you! Glad you liked the picture.
Honestly it depends on what you like to do and see. I‚Äôm a huge food guy so I always tend to have my trips revolve around different restaurants and gastronomic experiences. Montreal has an incredible food scene so I‚Äôd definitely suggest to come back once the restaurants reopen, if you‚Äôre into that sort of thing. It allows you to explore a bunch of different neighbourhoods and you‚Äôll always leave satisfied and full! Haha check out the [Eater Essential 38 Restaurants](https://montreal.eater.com/maps/38-best-restaurants-in-montreal) for an idea of what‚Äôs popular!
Cool merci
"grain de sel" here, thank you for recognizing the fact that Montr√©al is a french speaking city. Love and Kisses!
So you illegally came to our province and ignored COVID protocols. Thanks üëç
Oh I love trying different cuisines, specially the ones that a particular place is known for. Unfortunately, I couldn't experience dining in due to covid restrictions but I did have Schwartz's smoked meat sandwich and brought a dozen bagels with me from Fairmont Bagels.
What are the places you'd recommend? I'll bookmark the link you shared.
Merci. I feel the obligation to speak in place's official language and ideally, I would have learned some French before this trip but I couldn't. It is definitely in my bucket list to pick up as soon as things go back to normal (I really don't want to take online classes). 
Hope to visit Montr√©al soon.
I visited Montreal during Easter long weekend, there wasn't any travel restriction in place at the time between Ontario and Quebec. I believe I mentioned that in my first comment on this post.
I know it wasn't the ideal time to travel but I did take all precautions I could think of as I currently do while living in Toronto. I care about my health and the fact that my decisions impact other people during this pandemic.
I understand your concern came from a genuine place but rest assured, I neither carried not contracted covid during my stay.
Again, it‚Äôs entirely up to what you like. Smoked meat is always a classic. I‚Äôm more of a St Viateur bagel kinda guy. In the Old Port area there are tons of great options like Olive & Gourmando, Tommy Cafe, Slice & Soda, Uniburger, Un po di piu, escondite, Garde Manger, Bremner. Otherwise Bombay Mahal is a great Indian option downtown and in Park-Ex. Little Italy has a bunch of great options like San Gennaro, Bottega, Lucca, gema, impasto, and Fumigale. Other really famous places are Liverpool House and Joe Beef, Pois Pench√©, moccione, Damas, Foiegwa, Ma Pouille Mouill√©, Chez Tousignant. The list goes on and on!
I know some people talk shit about us locals if "you Do not speak french while visiting Qu√©bec" but this is false. No one expect visitors to learn french on a 3 Days trip. Altough we have a few people moving here (because it is cheaper) and Hating on the local language and calling us racists...
Montr√©al is a big tourist city since 1967, we love to welcome people from all over the world!
I'm pretty much down to try anything at least once. I don't have any dietary restrictions. Lemme go through these places. 
Interestingly, I didn't try traditional poutine. Had some variant of poutine with potato wedges and fried egg from Universal Grill. Which poutine place would you recommend in the city?
What about activities? I want to go to Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Museum of Archeology and History, Science Centre, cinemas/theaters, and music scene.
> In the Old Port area there are tons of great options like Olive & Gourmando, Tommy Cafe, Slice & Soda, Uniburger, Un po di piu, escondite, Garde Manger, Bremner.
Ces restaurants ne sont pas dans le vieux-port! Au nord de la rue de la commune ce n'est plus le site du vieux port!
Edit: pour les gens qui ne sont pas d'accord, vous pouvez essayer de me prouver que ces restos sont dans le "vieux port" selon vous!
IMO, it's not racist to expect people to learn a predominant language of a city/province if they plan on living there. I'm an immigrant to Canada. I loved the hospitality, the multiculturalism, and the history of the city. Honestly, I see myself living there. Learning French has been in my bucket because I know that Canada, the country I moved to to settle my life, has both English and French as its official languages.
Yeah buddy we hate the local language lol. This type of reductionist thinking is the core problem in this province. 
Have you ever considered people might have issue with (or ‚Äúhate‚Äù since you seem to think in those black and white terms) having a one-issue, populist prime minister from a separatist / QC nationalist / isolationist party making decisions on how immigration should work?
Yeah you welcome people from all over the world for sure, as long as they speak French. I‚Äôm sorry if others somehow turned this issue into calling locals racist, that‚Äôs not my intention. But Quebecs treatments of English speaking temporary residents is abysmal. So many issues that I‚Äôm not gonna go there, but it is one of the worst places in Canada to settle if you Do Not Speak French. Period. Quebec has the lowest company tax rates in Canada because no international company (nor an international minded person) wants to move here. 
Tldr; what the OP means I believe is ‚Äúwe welcome people from all over the world as long as they‚Äôre just tourists here for a few days. You are an English speaking expat who needs to be here for a few years for work? QC says ‚ÄúGO F&$K YOURSELF‚Äù
My personal favourites for poutine are Chez Tousignant, La Banquise, and Lafleur!
Fair enough! C‚Äôest resto sont √† Vieux Montr√©al**
>Yeah buddy we hate the local language lo
Je ne parle pas de toi. Je parle en g√©n√©ral. Les gens qui insulte la protection de la langue fran√ßaise par exemple. C'est fr√©quent.
>You are an English speaking expat who needs to be here for a few years for work? QC says ‚ÄúGO F&$K YOURSELF‚Äù
J'esp√®re que tu blagues... C'est rendu quasiment plus facile de se trouver une job a Montr√©al sans parler fran√ßais que sans parler anglais!
Sans compter la multitude d'immigrants qui arrivent ici sans parler fran√ßais qui r√©ussissent √† se d√©brouiller en quelques mois!
> but it is one of the worst places in Canada to settle if you Do Not Speak French. Period.
Donc pour toi, la seule province francophone au Canada est la pire place pour s'installer si tu ne parles pas fran√ßais?
Definitely checking 'em out!
The fact that you switched to French just to respond to my comment about the anti English sentiment in Quebec is just perfect. Good job gabmori you win this one...
Le sub permet d'√©crire en fran√ßais. If you cannot understand french, you mention it and people Will gladly switch to english, this is what montrealers Do ;)

/r/hailcorporate
I see it. I'm just missing the indie band.
French canadian grandma's often say "de la fleur" when talking about flour obviously because of the pronunciation that sounds like flower. Having Five Roses written on a bag of flour must have played it's part to make them think that was right. Of course it has nothing to do, it's just a brand.
They peddle the stuff
why is this not common sense
Oh no, now everyone will dress like homeless people to take a walk at 8. /s
Legault insisting that the curfew needed to apply to the homeless, and doubling down on that position, reminds me of Coderre's pitbull ban. Both were wildly unpopular with broad swaths of the electorate, deemed counter-productive by experts, and yet in both cases politicians insisted that they were right and the electorate, the experts, basically everyone else, was actually wrong.  
EDIT: I fully expect the Legault government to appeal, probably with some bullshit rhetoric about how this ruling risks undoing the sacrifice of all Quebecers up to this point, that this is about saving lives, and some other sanctimonious pontification.

thank God üòÅ
Lurker here. Whats going on, where's the government support?
In New Zealand and some states of Australia, the government's paid for hotel rooms for the homeless when movement restrictions were in place last year. Its not like tourists were using them anyway. And to hear a homeless person froze to death, it's appalling
Good! Shame on Legault and the dirt bag cops who handed out those tickets.
Wow quelle bonne nouvelle que le syst√®me r√©it√®re que ceux qui ont pas de logis ne peuvent pas rentrer dans un chez eux non-existent!

OK, now let's make having a roof a right and actually give homeless people a place to live, without any strings attached. Homelessness is a black stain on any civilized society.
Why do we even have homeless people in a first world country
Do we not have the resources to fix that as a problem? I understand it's a complex problem, but I feel like we should be able to figure it out
Embarrassed to be Born in Quebec , sad as fuck
'bout fucking time.
There's just a bit over 1 week left and they figure this out now!?
okay sure that's cool, but what about the shelters?
... until February 5.
Lol you can't even drive around past curfew without getting pulled over there?
As if homeless people with no money were being ticketed.
Vagrancy is illegal, but cops aren‚Äôt rounding up the homeless every night.  They ignore homeless people, most.  The curfew is no different.
It is a syllogism. One cannot readily shelter if one is homeless. People who are homeless must deal with all manner of aggressive, even dangerous individuals who may be vying for limited shelter. Legault is an economist. He looks at the number of beds spread across the city versus the number of homeless, snaps his fingers, and demands homeless people magically transport themselves to these shelters by 8pm.  It is actually unbelievable an intelligent political leader could expect such a decree to be taken seriously.
They only hire people who obey, common sense is frowned upon at the SPVM
Because the CAQ is in power.
PM is a tough guy who is always protecting the rights of the persecuted majority. His logic is that, if the homeless are exempt, what's to stop all the Jews and Muslims from becoming homeless and converting our youth through their high sense of fashion.
bUt nOW AnYOne cAn ClAIm theY ARe HoMELes aNd StaY OuT paSt 8Pm
I think it is common sense, but legault prefered keeping this unclear as homelesness is a hard thing to deal with and even define
Since everyone is giving brainless improvised answers so far: the argument against this is that people will claim they're homeless when they're not. It makes the curfew hard to enforce and may increase confrontations.
I'm no expert on public health (certainly nobody here is) but personally I think cutting the homeless some slack is the right call. Folks enforcing the curfew just need to somehow handle this challenge.
Can't wait to be outside in -15 degree weather for absolutely  no reason at all!
People dressed as pigs and dogs to go taunt the cops about the curfew thingy. Remember that couple in Sherbrooke too?The lady taking the hubbie on a leash for a walk? Remember the potato sack guy I couple years back? 
I suspect that yes, people will dress and are dressing as homeless right now just to be contrarian smart asses. 
This said, what a terrible loss of opportunity. The intelligent, empathetic, long term thing yo do would have been to shelter the homeless (there is million of square foot empty commercial space in MTL right now) and pass an emergency bill to build transitional homes.
Imo, appealing this judgement would result in a PR nightmare. Legault will probably take this loss silently to minimize the impact on his popularity
Daddy can‚Äôt be wrong
>I fully expect the Legault government to appeal, probably with some  bullshit rhetoric about how this ruling risks undoing the sacrifice of  all Quebecers up to this point, that this is about saving lives, and  some other sanctimonious pontification.
I thought the same but surprisingly they just announced that they wouldn't contest it. See [tweets](https://twitter.com/CarmantLionel/status/1354413841401196547) from Lionel Carmant the health minister.
No one outside after 8pm.
Okay, give them a home to go to.

I heard a testimony about the one who died in a portapotty. Apparently he was extremely diligent when it came to rules and goodwill towards others. This falls squarely on the CAQ approach to the homeless, because they pay no attention to mental health.
> homeless people deserve understanding, respect and compassion as they struggle to survive the COVID-19 pandemic.
Well said. If this pandemic has taught us anything, we're all in the same giant boat here. We need to help each other out or we all fail together.
>one died hiding in a portable toilet while out past curfew
That s terrible... is he counted as a covid victim then ?
> one died hiding in a portable toilet
That's a shitty way to go.
Les sans abris ne peuvent pas liker sur le Facebook de la CAQ
Yup let's oppress those who won't vote for him. ¬†In 2021, Legault will undergo another kind of test: strengthening the French language across the province, starting with downtown Montreal.
Needs to focus priorities that matter

As always, the situation is more nuanced than what is presented.
There are hotel rooms available to the homeless. Many homeless people go there. Many refuse because they can't or don't want to abide to the rules in place there (no pets, no drugs, no alcohol).
Officially, the homeless were not exempt from the curfew. However, the Premier stated publicly that objective of the curfew was not to penalise the homeless and that he trusted the judgment  of the police to not apply it to the homeless.
A homeless individual with many arrest warrants was afraid to be caught by the police due to the increased attention the curfew would bring on him. He decided to hide in a toilet and died frozen there.
Other homeless individuals have been reported as receiving fines in relation to the curfew. I haven't seen the details on each one of them, but I know that in one case the actual motives for the arrest and the fines were related to drug traffic. For the others, I don't know. They may have been motivated by something else, or they may also have been entirely pointless.
Many people have been asking the government to officially make the homeless exempt from the curfew. The government has been hesitant on that front. The official reasoning is that people would use that as an excuse and reduce the impact of the curfew. It most likely is because codifying what is an homeless person into law is a problem in itself (precise definitions are hard, and loopholes are easy, You don't want your definition to accidently apply to, say, all the students living in a dorm and stuff like that.).
In the end, I don't think this judgment is going to change anything at all. It seems to be in line with the actual intent of the law. Moreoever, police officers are still allowed to fine homeless people. They just have a mean to overturn the fine in court. And being homeless they'll probably want to avoid going to court for a multitude of reasons.
> Why do we even have homeless people in a first world country
To scare the people into accepting shitty jobs where the boss abuse them.
then why did the court say otherwise?
are you saying the judge lied? maybe you should bring that to the media since they like stories about corruption
> an intelligent political leader could expect such a degree to be taken seriously
he's intelligent based on what metric exactly? hes only in power because of the boomers outside of montreal who vote for him en masse
Cops with IQs over 100 are generally frown upon and not hired.
The sweet zone is 80-95, just below average. As those people are more likely to blindly follow orders yet are still almost fully functional people.
It would appear the Hasids are exempt (/s)
Most likely explanation. Having worked in these circles,  there is a surprisingly high amount of ¬´¬†we‚Äôll let the courts deal with that¬†¬ª with every new law, and I guess the same goes with a d√©cret.
>Since everyone is giving brainless improvised answers so far: the argument against this is that people will claim they're homeless when they're not. It makes the curfew hard to enforce and may increase confrontations.
This is how you make one rule for the majority and let everyone else down ...  
The issue with this is, you only realise you are not part of the majority when it is too late.
It's going to be extra bad this year.  Lots of solo dog walkers out alone after curfew this year and they didn't pick up shit...literally.
Dites moi si je me trompe mais est-ce que genre le m√™me propri√©taire de chien qui fait chier son chien a chaque jour au m√™me spot et qui ne ramasse pas? Ou se sont des gens qui se disent : Ben l√† si l'autre d'avant n'a pas ramass√©, je ne le ferai pas aussi.
This is my second winter in Montreal after moving here from San Diego (I know, I know..). The very first thing I noticed once the snow started melting, was the wonderful piss smell that overtook the streets of Notre Dame. I could see literal yellow pools of piss and frozen layers of shit. It was the worst lasagna I had ever seen.
I installed a camera on my house window to find the culprit whose dog has been shitting on my neighbors front lawn and when I found out who it was, I followed him to his residence. Now that I knew who it was, I started collecting up his dog shit and then I rubbed it all over his door with a note stating "I  believe this belongs to you"  very satisfying to not say the least.
Avec un extra de milliers de vieux masques garoch√©s par terre par des ostie de sauvages...
I can never get around how clean Toronto is and how trash Montreal is. Seriously people. What. In. The. Fuck.
Et des milliers de botchs de cigarettes. Merci, chers citoyens!
Sur le chemin pour aller √† la garderie, il y a une grande √©cole faite sur le long avec pas mal de gazon en avant. C'est l'endroit id√©al normalement pour laisser ma fille marcher dans le gazon/neige, ce qu'elle adore faire comme la plupart des enfants de son √¢ge. On tente de lui apprendre √† ne pas aller se promener sur les terrains priv√©s, mais sur le terrain d'une √©cole, elle a du fun pis √ßa d√©range pas vraiment personne...
√áa a pris fin cette semaine. Je sais pas si je l'avais juste pas vu avant, mais la quantit√© de marde de chien sur le terrain de l'√©cole est vraiment incroyable. √áa ressemble √† la photo. Une √©cole ciboire... Gang de pas propres.
Je d√©teste √ßa.. Mon chien mange que tu raw food faique ses besoins c'est des petites crottes qui de d√©sint√®gre a un coup de vent trop fort mais m√™me √† √ßa j'ai jamais pas ramass√©, ca prend quoi, 10 secondes? J'essaye toujours de ramasser quand j'en vois, ce qui m'√©nerve le plus c'est le monde qui laissent leurs asti de sac trainer, genre what the fuck ta fait 98% de la job d√©j√†!!
Je vois l'√©coresponsabilit√© √† l'oeuvre.   C'est du compostage.
This is how you attract rats. They love dog shit
Yeah I noticed today also. Dog poop doesn‚Äôt go away throughout winter this should be a r/youshouldknow post.
Ca le rend frais.

People are just so disgusting..this makes it hard to walk around the city every corner dog shit!

Very good for the soil
My kids aren't good direction followers, but they know I will totally spank them in public in front of their friends if I find out they didn't pick up the dog poop.
D ici quelque semaine on aura aussi des postes sur les cycliste :D , chaque ann√© c est la meme chose
Hey c'est chez moi! J'ai remarqu√© √ßa dans ce lieu exacte hier.
this is why dog permits need to be expensive
Those assholes is what gives a bad reputation to the average dog owner, who ensure that their pet excrement is picked up as it happens.
As an owner I am like an ex-smoker when I see this happening, I tend to "shit" on the ignorant owner and make him/her clean up the puppy's mess.
Si vous vouyez quelqu'un laisser la marde de leur chien a terre, ramasser le et jeter le sur le proprio lol
fuck le monde
That is like food for nature.  It doesn't bother me.
Saw a man near my house pick up his dogs poops, put them in the bag, and then throw the bag right back in the snow drift. There was a trashcan 5 feet away. Why?????
And here i was telling my friends it's getting better every year. In Sud Ouest area i used to have to jump around them all the time. Now i barely see them. .. it could also be because rim working from home
#NotAllDogOwners are bad, but there is sure a lot of them that are ruining it for everybody.
You should see my downstairs neighbours place. Multiple dogs, doesn‚Äôt look like they‚Äôve tried to pick it up once. Looks like hell down there.
üòÇ
Is it really Montreal if it doesn't smell like dog poop everywhere you go though? The best you can expect is to not step on it when you get in the elevator.
Se plaindre c'est bien et parfois √ßa marche, mais la meilleure chose que vous puissiez faire pour le moment est de faire un peu de m√©nage dans votre rue. Procurez-vous un sac poubelle et faites-le, les voisins ne s'en soucieront pas, certains pourraient m√™me le remarquer. Parlez √©galement √† votre mairie d'un plan pour r√©soudre le probl√®me √† plus long terme.

I'm a dog owner and those assholes should be forced to eat their dog's shit.
I lived for 20 years around Parc Laurier. The smell in Spring was horrible.
Les m√©mes gens qui tassent leurs masques us√©es par terre...
Tr√®s bonne question... S√©rieusement dans tous les cas c'est fucking trashy... En plus c'est dans une petite rue ben cute du plateau pas loin du m√©tro laurier...
Les chiens ont g√©n√©ralement leurs spots. √áa va varier de temps en temps, mais si tu les prom√®nes sur plus ou moins la m√™me route il va avoir un pattern. Dr√¥le de spot quand m√™me... sur le terre-plein de la piste cyclable (doit √™tre le seul endroit o√π il y a de la terre).
Genre de proprio qui doit punir son chien quand il pisse dans la maison car il est trop paresseux de le marcher quand le chien demande la porte.
Que voulez-vous‚Ä¶ un con c‚Äôest un con.
Y'a tu quelqu'un qui sait mettons que j'suis petty pis que j'veux ruiner la journ√©e de quelqu'un que j'viens de voir jeter son masque √† terre/pas ramasser sa marde y'a tu une place ou je peux appeler pis d√©noncer? J'sais que c'est ill√©gal pis que y'a des amendes.
The piss smell on notre dame isn't from the dogs lol
Oh dude... I should NOT have read this comment while eating my lasagna.
What happened after that?
Ok that amazing if its true !
Sans oublier la shit ton de d√©chets qui partent au vent
Toronto is a clean version of Cleveland.
Well first off they have garbage bins at EVERY corner.
Last time I went to Toronto it was far worse than Montreal.. (July 2019)
We can assume most people in Toronto rent units or rooms because of the property prices, and a lot of landlords/roommates aren't keen on having pets on the premices.
So I guess not a lot of people have dogs.
>Interdire de fumer dans les parcs publics et dans certaines rues. Ils l'ont fait dans de nombreux pays - je donne l'exemple de la Tha√Ølande. √Ä Bangkok, il est interdit de fumer dans les parcs et il est appliqu√©. Si vous jetez vos botchs sur la rue et qu'un flic vous voit, vous aurez une amende.
C'est qui le cave qui a decider d'enlever les cendriers d'a cote des portes et qui force le monde a aller fumer dans le mileu de la rue? Tse q'un botch ca se garde mal dans ses poches.
au moins mes botchs de joints sont biodegradable :o
Is it as good as the Mugler exhibit they had at BAM a couple of years ago? That one was terrific.
Did they fix the over sensitive alarm when you watch the dresses a bit too close?
Looks nice, will definitely go it out, thanks!
I wish I will be able to check it out in person!
Christian dior dior
\#BringbackVicktoriaSecretgirls
I haven't seen that, but judging by the photos of the Mugler exhibit, I'd say this one is much, much smaller and more basic. Not flashy. Dresses from the late 40s-early 50s only, along with some learning stuff about the embroidery and beading processes and whatnot. Definitely not a high budget exhibit.
[deleted]
Better ! I was impressed by the amount of amazing pieces. Only comment is they put the plaques further than the sensor. Each time you want to read somethings, it sets off a beep. Hopefully they adjusted it !
Seen both. Dior Is much smaller. Don‚Äôt miss the Chapleau exhibit if you go.
Haha! No. I set it off at least three times, and while I was there, at least three other people set it off. They really don't want your hands in there!
what do you mean?
The Mugler one blew me away. I have some interest in fashion, but it's definitely not something I'm passionate about so I was pretty surprised at how much I enjoyed it.
Might still check out the Dior one though. Thanks for the tip!
I feel like Mugler was much more Haute Couture and Dior was a lot of pret √† porter. They explained how they would ¬´¬†rent¬†¬ª the dresses of the season, import them to Montreal and then make copies and have to send the original back. Something like that. I think a lot of the dresses we saw in the Dior collection were not made in Paris in the Dior ateliers‚Ä¶. But I‚Äôm no expert.
Ah, thanks.
Yeah, I'm still not over that Mugler power suit made with f'n TYRES. I must have stared at it for 15 minutes. It was *gorgeous*. Even the purse and headpiece were made with tyres, yet it was incredibly elegant and classy.
I guess it depends what you're going for. For us, it was about exploring the era presented and the way things were sewn together, the shape, and the materials used. It was really interesting for us. But like I said above, it's not a flashy exhibit at all.
[deleted]
And those insect inspired outfits too were quite something!
Dire qu'il y avait une autoroute √† cet endroit exact il n'y a pas encore 10 ans.

It actually a really popular area, there's also an outdoor fitness area that is packed every day. When you live in the city, you take whatever green space you can get.

yeah its quite popular, i used to live in Lowney 2 but left because of how shitty life in griffintown is
Nice pic by the way üòâ
No there is too much building to see
Yeah my heart goes out to the people living in Griffintown. There's probably another 3 years of construction hell before it is a nice place to live, but I think it will be really nice when it gets it's shit together.

√áa arrive tellement souvent avec les corneilles qui attaquent leurs pr√©dateurs. dans le  bois√© du parc Thomas-Chapais j'ai souvent vu ce genre de comportement, et ce qui est tr√®s sp√©ciale, c'est que les corneilles appellent d'autre corneilles, qui semblent arriver toujours de plus en plus loin. Elles ont un bon syst√®me de d√©fense et de communication, le Canada devrait prendre exemple.

√Ä tous les soirs, √† la m√™me heure, y'a au moins 1000 corneilles qui viennent se rencontrer, et se racontent leur journ√©e, toutes perch√©es au sommet des plus hautes branches des arbres du bois√©. C'est assez √©tonnant comme spectacle...

Notez que les corneilles sont parmi les oiseaux les plus intelligent et aussi parmi les collaborateurs.
Mais quelle bande d'idiots! Je ne suis pas d'accord avec le couvre feu mais ceci n'aide en rien la situation! En plus, ces commer√ßants ont probablement d√©j√† de la mis√®re √† g√©n√©rer des revenus, ils doivent maintenant payer pour ces d√©g√¢ts!
Wrong target boys...
Ah yes, destroying barely surviving business‚Äô windows will definitely help them get what they want. Fkn morons
Why the fuck do people always protest and riot by smashing private property? You're pissed off at the governments inability to get organized and get you free of a curfew? So smash city hall not a restaurant. Pieces of shit
I think the curfew and some of the measures in place are a load of crap to be honest. 
But setting fires and breaking windows and destroying other people‚Äôs property? Not cool.
I am SO fucking angry at this right now. I worked down this street when offices are open, most of the people who own and run these businesses are having it super hard without the usual workers and tourism in the area, they're kind and local. What the fuck is wrong with these people!?   
I need to get my ass down there this weekend and go buy shit, I know it won't mean much, but these businesses need support.
Esti de gagne de d√©chets de soci√©t√©...
Come on. J'esp√®re qu'ils vont se faire prendre. Ils viennent de decredibiliser toute opposition organis√©e contre les politiques actuelles du gouvernement.
so stupid. these business owners aren't the ones responsible for where we're at right now.
biked through the old port at about 6:30pm yesterday... felt uncomfortable immediately and the riot hadn't even started yet. Basically huge crowds of douchey 18 year old males spoiling for a fight. Purposely blocking the bike path and inviting you to challenge them so they could prove their masculinity. Felt very.... suburban kids gone wild.
I found this on Twitter.  Seems like it was a decent crowd though it also seems pretty organic and disorganized so I'm not really surprised it devolved into vandalism.  At one point the crowd starts shouting "FUCK LEGAULT!" in unison and there were fireworks!
https://twitter.com/BezirganMocha/status/1381400379724857345
These folks are hitting on the wrong targets. They're stamping shithead labels on people who question the new measures.
Riots like these were obviously expected, but damn, this is hard to sympathize with.
osti que c'est stupide. je suis contre le couvre-feu, mais je ne veux aucune association avec du monde qui p√®te des vitres pis saccage des commerces. mon commentaire d'il y a peine 45 minute a mal vieilli en tsi
Won‚Äôt be surprised if we head into a whole ass lockdown after this. Wish the police used the same energy they had with the people protesting for actual justice back in June (blm) but nope ü§≠
Like anybody with sense, I‚Äôm pro-protest and anti-violence, so suffice it to say that the rioters are 100% in the wrong here and deserve what‚Äôs coming to them. But I‚Äôm not in the least bit surprised that things have played out this way. It‚Äôs all of Legault‚Äôs doing, his piss poor show of leadership is the cause of this. He‚Äôs been taking advantage of the power he has and fucking with people‚Äôs lives just because he can. He‚Äôs not actually governing, he‚Äôs just playing god emperor at this point.
His policies have no rhyme or logic and worst of all, are inconsistently applied. People‚Äôs patience with him is stretched thin, and so this is the end result. The blame is at both ends, but more so with him.
Looks like the same protest group led by libertarians and alt-righters that have marched in Montreal for the last few weeks: [https://cultmtl.com/2021/04/watch-scenes-from-the-anti-curfew-protest-in-old-montreal-tonight/](https://cultmtl.com/2021/04/watch-scenes-from-the-anti-curfew-protest-in-old-montreal-tonight/)
These businesses have been through enough ! I feel your frustration with the lockdowns and curfew but you are taking your anger out on the wrong people ...
[CBC now has a piece up](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/curfew-protest-1.5983606)
This is what bothers me. I was legitimately upset about the curfew and considered joining a protest. Now anything the protests were meant to stand for are now completely delegitimized.. thanks idiots. Also, why break property?
Je pense que cette gagne font juste profiter de la situation pour faire de la casse. Un peu quand le Canadiens va en s√©ries √©liminatoires.
Avons nous une liste des commerces affect√©es par le saccage d‚Äôhier? √áa serait bien de pouvoir savoir qui encourager. 
J‚Äôai vu que des vitrines de la SAQ ont √©t√© bris√©s, mais bon, ce n‚Äôest pas eux que je cherche √† aider
Legault should pay for the repairs out of his own damn deep, crooked pocket. Enough with the curfew. Placing the entire population under 9 hours of house arrest every night is unacceptable in a free society.
What else do you expect people to do when you impose a measure that is unlikely to actually help control transmission? 
A simple protest would be fine, no need to smash windows though.
FFS. This needs to be protested but if you're going to smash something,  stick to police stations and government buildings.
Not condoning destruction of property however the courts have refused to hear all legal challenges to the curfew. There is unresolved dubiousness of the legality of the curfew. There isn't any transparency in terms of what data was used to justify it. We as citizens are powerless against this tyranny. There is no justification however to damage privately owned property.
Protesters: ‚ÄúSmall businesses are suffering! Canadians are losing their livelihoods! End the lockdown!‚Äù
Also protesters: Proceeds to destroy small business property, likely putting the last nail in the coffin for many business owners.
People with zero agency on themselves and no values pretend to support the most just causes as an excuse for their vile behaviour.
The craziest part is that there would be a much better way to protest without any violence. I don't think violence is ever the solution, but I understand why there are times the ppl are pushed so far that they think violence is the only way they will get listened to.
Take notes protestors: civil disobedience is the way to go with this. The problem is large enough for the media and general population to notice anlar civil disobedience movement. It can be simple... Set up in a public place sit down and stay after 8pm. Just sit, outside, 2m apart, with masks. Just show disobedience toward the rule and the measures in place. 
If you are fortunate enought to have a car, protest from your car. Setup a protest drive past 8 pm.
The media wi gulp this down in a heart beat, the gov will feel the pressure to at least review their strategy.
What should you expect when you beat down a population continuously with no end in sight after 3 MONTHS of curfew. When most of the young people at that protest are people who have been locked in their 3 1/2 for months and months on end and now they are tightening restrictions even more. Oh yeah how could this possibly have happened I truly don't understand.
Legault must assume 100% of the blame for this. He is suggesting that moving the curfew up by 1.5 hours is driving the third wave, the most abject and insulting nonsense.  The curfew does not work... it has not stopped the third wave. He believes that only wicked city people go out at night, his "gouvernement de banlieue" is imposing his puritanical vision. Legault has frozen the ability to do the slightest thing through legitimate politics in the system... it's all about force and propaganda with him... the only answer available becomes the sort of thing we saw there... I think it's shameful how we have been "docile" as his police minister put it... some pride has been restored.
Blaming Antifa and BLM in 5...4...3...
Non mais calice. On est tous frustr√© mais les pauvres commer√ßants on rien √† faire avec le couvre feux... Cibole people. Agir en adulte responsable c'est pas donn√© √† tous...
Some people are just too dumb to know that they're dumb
Jokes is Ontario and Quebec have the most strictest restrictions of covid 19 but are getting rekt by a third wave anyways.
FFS! I can't even... Cops aren't gonna do a thing cause they can use this as leverage next time. Those poor businesses. and i heard someone lit a fire at the old port.
Too bad cause the court house is right next door
That's only gonna get worse if they keep going with that bullshit curfew. What part of the protesters did there is HORRIBLE but I knew it would happen. That would be naive to think it would not turn into some kind of riots....
Is this those fucking anti-mask morons again?
Wooooow what a bunch of assholes. C'est quoi le but??
[removed]
I get the anger and frustration about the pointless curfew but smashing storefronts of the already struggling merchants is beyond idiotic. I really sympathize with them.
What a bunch of idiots!  I don't agree with the curfew but this does **not** help the situation!  In addition, these businesses are probably already struggling. They now have to pay for this senseless damage!
Wow no words can express how I feel for the business owners... üíî Of course this was gonna happen
Cool cool cool cool. Really smart. I think the government will open up now. They won‚Äôt put any more restrictions now. Message sent.
My grandfather died of covid last night because a stupid family member decided that they were tired of covid restrictions. Having unnecessary social contacts and eating meals with people from different households is how this virus spreads. I know the curfew sucks but people need to realize that people are freaking dying because of this shit. I have a family member that now has to live with the fact that his reckless behaviour and desire for a little fun killed his father. Don‚Äôt be that person. It‚Äôs easy to think you know better than public health and medical professionals but you don‚Äôt.
Can the cops put these fucking animals in jail?
Criss de gang de colons.
I think we will see alot more civil disobedience moving forward if politicians dont get their shit together with the roll out of vaccines.
They could have broken every single window and they still wouldnt have done as much damage to Montreal as Legault...
LOL it‚Äôs just the beginning . Now that it‚Äôs been ‚Äúinitiated‚Äù other people will follow and it will most likely get worse . Enough is enough and I‚Äôm tired of hiding behind a curtain because dumb fucks will judge me for the opinion I have , hell even the government will shame me because I dare to think differently . I don‚Äôt condone smashing windows but a peaceful protest was never gonna make any difference .
Les panneaux sont beaucoup trop tard, il est souvent difficile de savoir quelle voie va o√∫ avant de se retrouver au denier moment dessus et donc bloqu√©. La circulation dans Montr√©al c‚Äôest vraiment √† rendre fou tellement √ßa fait pas de sens.
It‚Äôs really not great signage. The clusterfuck at Rachel doesn‚Äôt help either.
These people wouldn‚Äôt survive the poorly-marked weekly changes to dorval circle lane assignments. ü§£
I've been here for two years, and I see people going straight in the second lane from the left all the time. I mean, yeah it's illegal, but usually not a big deal. BUT, the number of people who lose their minds at people trying to legally turn left... If I had a dollar for every time I see one, I'd have enough money to repaint the left-turn arrows on the ground to make sure everyone knows.
90% of them know. They're just being dicks.
There's a yellow warning sign halfway up the block, in addition to the black signs pictured.
The only real improvement would be to hang lane indicators above the road, kinda like they use on the bridge though they can be static signs rather than electronic. Make it abundantly clear that it's left-left-straight-straight-right.
Il faudrait qu‚Äôen premier les gens apprenne √† quoi serve ces panneaux et portent plus attention √† ceux-ci. (Savoir o√π on s‚Äôen va aide aussi)
I think your first battle is convincing many Montr√©al drivers of the concept of "lanes" in general.
Toute la gestion de l‚Äôentr√©e/sortie du pont Jacques Cartier du cot√© de Montreal est catastrophique. La mairie a aucune envie de rendre √ßa plus fluide malgr√© que √ßa cause des tonnes de dioxide de carbone en plus sur l‚Äôile avec la congestion non-stop.
I never had so much difficulty turning left until I moved to montreal it's insane.
Bad signs and shitty drivers in mtl, the more it changes‚Ä¶ :p
Je passe l√† chaque soir en revenant du travail et le nombre de personne qui vont tout droit est quand m√™me intense. Funny story, personne va dans la voie quand c'est un feu rouge mais quand c'est vert ils y vont parce qu'il y a moins de chars....
Unfortunately doing this in QC is not going to be obvious as we only repaint arrows on the roads in September after the winter washes them away lmao.
More signs in the intersection required.
It gets even more confusing. There is two green arrows, one going left, one going straight.
On the right side of the road is marked that the right most lane is right turns only, so in reality you have Left-Left-Right according to the signs, but not the traffic lights.
These aren't marked as the usual Obligation to turn signs (the arrows circled in green).
This is piss poor signage by the city, if you got a ticket for it you could contest it and likely win.
Et le pire est √† venir au coin de Rachel!
Frontenac and Notre-Dame's 2 left turning lanes going north is another clusterfucked intersection.
√áa serait pas mtl sans un peu de confusion √† presque chaque intersection.
They need to start hanging more signs above. Paint gets washed off every winter and the signs are too far for drivers to see easily imho.
People in Montreal forgot how to drive. None of the drivers follow the road signs or rules.
Similar for Pie-IX south crossing Montreal in the evening. You can turn left or go straight in the middle lane. I always get honked at for turning.
My wife got chased and was harassed racially by 2 drivers because of this. People seem to be road sign illiterate.
That is why in some countries they have better traffic lights, one for each lane with a clear indicator above the traffic light on what you do in that lane. https://images.app.goo.gl/3BvGnQtWrTqCPTKfA
Another good reason to use Waze and always enter your route even if you know it. They have a little rectangle pop up in the top of the screen showing which lane you should be in.
has anyone tried reaching out to the city/media about this? 
This post alone got almost 400 likes and 60 comments, surely if we draft a letter and send it to the city and all the media outlets there will be at least some attention to fix these issues that seem like easy work to solve.
I'd be really curious to know who is in charge of the management of the street signs and lights and what are their daily activities/duties and are they even trying to optimize street traffic on a routine basis?
C'est la m√™me chose au coin de Decelles et Queen-Mary √† C√¥te-des-Neiges. La voie de gauche doit tourner √† gauche et la voie de droite va tout droit. Le seul hick dans ce cas c'est que pour aller tout droit, on doit s'entasser √† gauche parce qu'il y une piste cyclable. 
Combien de fois on m'a klaxonn√© parce que j'ai "coup√©" le gars de la voie de gauche qui decide d'aller tout droit. Je parle du panneau qui indique quelle voie fait va o√π mais habituellement la personne ne veut rien savoir parce que j'aurais d√ª regarder avant de changer de voie. En tout cas...
Best thing for the city, have a cop there to ticket people. They will make a fortune.
They know what they're doing.

Ah oui la signal√©tique routi√®re, un d√©sastre √† la grandeur de la r√©gion m√©tropolitaine
Just repainting the arrows on the ground would help, but we know the story don't we...
The sign is conveniently situated past the point of no return
I remember when they redid part of Notre-Dame in Hochelaga. They painted temporary lanes, but the issue was that lane configuration changed almost every day. So some people would follow the temporary painted lanes that were incorrect most of the time.
[deleted]
Large painted arrows on the road would help.  But that‚Äôs not something Montreal is very good at.
Peut-√™tre qu‚Äôils ont pas vu le panneau, ils sont petits et quelques m√®tres avant le carrefour.
Le mieux serait deux panneaux suspendus au-dessus des voies pour indiquer le virage √† gauche dans chaque voie
I don't think montreal repaints anything ever.
Voil√†. Tout le monde se croit plus important/press√© que tout le monde.
Fair point.
en premier? non, en premier les panneaux doivent avoir du sens!
et puis, c'est pas √† √ßa que les panneaux doivent servir, savoir o√π on s'en va?
lol, yeah.
Although to be fair, just seeing the painted lines is half the battle sometimes.
En m√™me temps si tu rends √ßa trop fluide les gens vont plus l'utiliser et √ßa va faire encore plus de pollution.
The arrow circled in green applies to the whole intersection. Since you can turn both left and right as well as continue straight, such signage would be useless.
When there is many lanes it is common to have only part of the lanes on the signage and have one half on both sides.
Sur la base des commentaires ici, je ne veux pas l'essayer. :P
one cannot forget how to drive if you never learned how to drive.
they often only follow exactly what is in front of their nose, while wearing horseblinders.
OK, that one is slightly excusable, since you \*can\* go straight.
Here, going straight is technically illegal, yet it's the people going straight who are losing their minds.
Oh wow, NEVER heard of that one before. I've seen people getting yelled at, flipped off, etc, but never this.

I had no idea this museum existed. After covid, I will definitely check it out. Thank you for sharing!
I wish Montreal had a huge natural history museum like other big cities, but redpath has quite a few cool little things to look at :)

Is it still the same exhibition as when I went with my school like 12-15 years ago?
It's freaking AMAZING! 
Probably got some stolen artefacts in there. Hopefully I'm incorrect on that though.
Still. Please donate if you go! But take your kids. The gorilla, the sea shells, the skeletons, the <gasp> shrunken heads. Crazy stuff.
Oh also the petrified log!
This channel is awesome!
A very classic "night at the museum" style museum. Highly recommend. Some years ago I visited during montreal's night time winter festival (Montr√©al en lumi√®res?). That visit was in the dark and you visited with a flashlight. Spooky scary skeletons and fun ambience. There was a conference after.
So many times I passed by and not entering because thought had to pay for it...now it's closed. :(
I have so many great memories of this place. We'd go here with my illustration & design Dawson college classmates in the late eighties to do life drawing in sketchbooks... We'd hit Peel Pub afterwards for some cheap pitchers and giggle our way through art history when we made it back to class. Sometimes we'd get the drinks before the sketch sessions, you know, to 'loosen up'. Good times.

Why are appointments even available by Bonjour Sant√©? As a place with public health care, shouldn‚Äôt we all be booking appointments through a no-fee-at-point-of-service application? 
For serious, I thought the whole point of public healthcare was that you don‚Äôt get worse care just because you can‚Äôt pay extra fees.
7 years and still waiting for a family doctor :(
Physician here who trained in Montreal for medical school and went to Calgary for residency in Family Medicine. 
Healthcare in Montreal and Quebec is terribly run. The government loves oversight, but doesn't do anything to improve access to care. A lot of their decisions sound good on paper and are executed terribly and they still stick by them. 
One of the biggest hurdles to getting a family doctor is the PREM system. This was designed to promote doctors working in underserved communities, which is great in theory. However in practice, it pushes doctors away from Quebec. 
From my colleagues who have applied this is my understanding of the PREM system (apologies if I get one or two things wrong, I have not applied for one myself because of the reasons you'll see below). 
In order to work in Quebec as a family doctor you need a PREM. You apply for one (and the application process is only a few times a year), whereby you select a region to work. In order to work in that region a clinic must accept you. But there is a long waiting period and multiple interviews you must undergo with some asshole docs who are trying to figure out why you chose that region and not up north or somewhere else more underserved. After about 8-10 months, you either get accepted or rejected. This is independent of if a clinic is in need of a doctor (ie: they just don't care). 
I know some of my friends who got rejected and some who got accepted after multiple tries. They want to force you to work elsewhere where there is need, but what they don't get is that there is so much need in Montreal as well! 
This prolonged annoying process makes people either not apply at all (because before all this you must also get your Quebec medical license and pass your french exams which are both already a process), and it becomes incredibly tedious. Imagine you're all ready to move and you have to wait this long only to find out you've been rejected? Why bother even planning on coming to Montreal? 
Other cities/provinces don't have this so for example if I wanted to start working in Alberta, all I need is my license from the college in Alberta and I can work ANYWHERE in Alberta immediately. Same with Ontario. 
If I want to work in Quebec without having a PREM, then I get a 30% reduction in my billings (before paying another 20-30% in overhead). So effectively I'm making less than 50% while I beg the government to give me a spot. 
It's hard to explain but it's a nightmare process. 
There's no perfect solution to increasing access in underserved communities, but for one, if you allow more doctors to come to your province like Alberta and Ontario for example, then if docs can't fill their panels, some of them might opt to do rural medicine on the side or for a period of time. Add in incentives like higher pay and less overhead and accept more IMGs looking for spots etc. But putting a barrier to care in your biggest cities is NOT the solution. 
There are other frustrations with the Quebec healthcare system that also make it less favorable as a workplace but this was the main one. I can explain others if anyone is interested, but the PREM system needs to be scrapped. 
If anyone wants to pressure the government for anything to change, this is the biggest target IMO.
It blows, but I've never had an issue booking an appointment online (without paying) if you book it when the slots are released in the morning
Just dealt with this today. Injured my foot and want an appointment to have it checked out to give me the all clear. Nothing major but as a diabetic it‚Äôs important to get it checked. Calling over 5 clinics and researching more online has yielded nothing. The only other quick option is the broken hospital system where you have to spend 12 hours waiting for a tired doctor to give you poorly done stitches which lead to an infection. I guess I just need to trust my foot will get better on its own.
J'ai trouv√© le truc :  va √† l'urgence.  Non sans blague, √ßa va √™tre long ,mais si t'es pas consid√©r√© "urgent" il vont te trouver un RDV dans une des cliniques m√™mes que tu pouvais pas avoir de RDV toi m√™me avec RVSQ ou Bonjour Sant√©.  
J'e l'ai fait moi-m√™me, diarrh√©e, peu pas aller travailler, mon boss m'oblige √† avoir un billet de m√©decin, RVSQ et Bonjour Sant√© me donne z√©ro r√©sultats :  Donc je me pr√©sente √† Sacr√©-Coeur.  J'attends une demie heure pour l'infirmier du triage; il me juge pas urgent, et trouve un RDV ON THE SPOT dans son ordi √† une clinique "sans RDV" pour 3-4 heures plus tard.  Une des m√™me clinique qui n'avait pus de place quand moi j'ai appel√©.
√áa explique pourquoi les cliniques n'ont pus de place:  elle sont toutes prises par les h√¥pitaux direct!  Alors maintenant je ne me casse plus la t√™te et je vais direct √† l'h√¥pital.  Eux me le trouve, mon " sans RDV"!
Aussi faire attention que Bonjour Sant√© charge un frais d'inscription de 25$ en plus du 6$ par mois. Si vous annulez l'abonnement √† renouvellement automatique, vous devrez repayer le 25$.
Even having a family doctor gets you little to nothing if you need aid outside of prescheduled visits for things like vaccinating your toddler and such. I have never, in nearly 20 years of being with the same family doctor, been able to get an appointment with him faster than three months. 
Bonour Sant√© and the RSVQ will give you the option to see a different doctor at the same clinic but there will never be a spot available; not once have I ever gotten an appointment with another physician through either service. 
Showing up for a sans-rendezvous at 6:00 AM in the morning and missing a few hours of pay from work are still the only effective way to see a doctor if you're not having an immediate life threatening event; and even then more than one person has ended up dead in a Quebec hospital without having seen a doctor first.
After years of trying to get family doctor, only to get one and have them retire a year later and have to start the process all over again, I finally went private. It sucks to have to pay, but at least making an appointment is easier and if one doctor leaves, they assign you a new one.
My girlfriend is from the US and still in the process of getting her PR, so she's not covered by the public healthcare system and has to pay out-of-pocket whenever she "sees" a doctor here. She's had a prescription for some meds for a long time and had to see a doctor over here to get a Canadian prescription as pharmacies couldn't take her US one. It's been a year now and she was told last month that the automated renewal had been denied by her doctor and she had to call him. They charged her 300$ for a 2 mins phone call during which her doctor literally asked her if everything was fine and hung up. Great system.
My employer has a subscription to [Dialogue](https://www.dialogue.co/). I can usually get an appointment (telehealth only) within a couple of hours at most. Unfortunately they don't cater to individuals, but their pricing is fair for small businesses.
This might not be the answer you're looking for, but I thought I'd put it out there anyways. I 100% agree that the walk-in system in Quebec is broken. My girlfriend has been waiting 6 years and counting for a family doctor.
Malheureusement, aucune solution n‚Äôexiste qui pourra r√©gler en 6 mois, un an, les millions de probl√®mes du r√©seau de la sant√©. Ce r√©seau est √©cras√© par une bureaucratie excessivement lourde mais aussi n√©cessaire. Barette avait tent√© de diminuer la charge bureaucratique en centralisant les points de services et en diminuant le personnel de bureaux. R√©sultats? Les employ√©s(es) sont de plus en plus √©puis√©s, la paperasse est encore plus lourde et confuse et tous ceux qui ont √©t√© mise √† pied, ont d√ª √™tre remplac√©s. Ajoutons √† cela, une p√©nurie de personnel et une pand√©mie qui finis plus de finir, le r√©seau est gravement malade.
Autre point, la population du Quebec est vieille, ce qui cause que beaucoup de gens occupent les h√¥pitaux/cliniques, voir m√™me, trop de gens. Combin√© avec le manque de main d‚Äô≈ìuvre, cela cause des attentes interminables aux urgences et de tr√®s longs d√©lais pour les rdv.   
Aussi, un membre cass√©s ou une coupure, c‚Äôest simple et rapide √† r√©gl√©, mais d√®s qu‚Äôon n‚Äôa affaire √† un mal plus sournois, (maux de ventre, cancer, infection, ect) les proc√©dures sont tr√®s longues. Les capacit√©s des laboratoires sont limit√©es et ne suffisent tout simplement pas √† la demande des clients. Un ami m‚Äôa d√©j√† dit que, une machine IRM peut faire jusqu\`a 10-12 test par jour, √† condition d‚Äôavoir le personnelle pour la faire rouler. Mais si tu √† 30 √† 40 demandes par jour d‚ÄôIRM, le temps d‚Äôattente ne fera que rallonger. Exemple, il y a plus de 325 signalements √† la DPJ par jour‚Ä¶ par jour, tu peux donc t‚Äôimaginer comment les intervenantes sont d√©bord√©es.  
Bref, il n‚Äôy pas de solutions miracle, ou si elle existe, elle prendra des ann√©es avant de s‚Äôappliqer.
I'd like to bring nuance to the situation:
Family doctors also think that the situation is bullshit.
I sort of work in the field of medical data. Some doctors I've produced reports for have over 10000 registered patients. To be able to go practice family medecine in another region is a process that takes about a year to be approved by the Ministry.
As for the RVSQ and private providers for booking, I see them at work. There's not many appointment available because the clinic also has to catter to their in-clinic patients, and many clinics are missing doctors or personnel.
Are private booking providers bullshit in my opinion? Yes.
Is RVSQ one of the worst systems I've ever seen in action? Yes, definitive yes.
But the core problem you're all skirting is the healthcare system in general here, which is rewritten every four years by idiots (no political alignment on my part here, they're all idiots) who think they'll get it better and get it worse every. Single. Time.
For more examples, read on the CISSS fusions and administrative bloating.
I can‚Äôt believe it isn‚Äôt a provincial outrage at the state of our healthcare.   It is absolutely atrocious.  
Not a walk in clinic, but my wife had to wait at the hospital for 9.5 hours with my five year olds because he got a really bad cut on his face.  
9.5 hours with a five year old is a travesty.
This truly hurts to hear.
I'm a nurse in an emergency room and we've become overrun with patients coming in that could go to a clinic.
We're understaffed and burnt out from the pandemic. 
And we don't like seeing patients waiting 12-16 hour wait times when a clinic is much more useful. 
Something needs to happen because when a clinic is unavailable these patients overspill into the emergency room...
> On the other hand, getting a family doctor is still impossible in this province. It took my brother 5 years to get one, and my parents are still waiting after 6 years. I've been on the waitlist for 3 and have zero hope of getting one any time soon.
7 years and counting here, and since I'm right near the bottom on the priority list, it's likely I will never get a family doctor until I'm a senior.
There's this clinic I go to that's pretty good, it's pretty easy to get an appointment (usually for the next day), you can get one online and you don't need a family doctor.  
http://www.santemontroyal.com/  
I didn't go there since before the pandemic though so I'm not sure if it's still as good as it was.
Depuis le d√©but de la pand√©mie, j'ai trouv√© que Info Sant√© (811) est devenu un bon point d'entr√©e pour obtenir un rendez-vous t√©l√©phonique. M√™me avec un probl√®me non urgent, un m√©decin m'a rappeler le jour m√™me. Et si le probl√®me demande une consultation, il devrait √™tre capable de vous rediriger au bon endroit. J'ai trouv√© que c'√©tait une alternative pas mal aux cliniques sans rendez-vous qui √©taient d√©j√† quasiment inexistantes avant la pand√©mie.
> This isn't a recent issue, yet there doesn't seem to be any attention paid to this from politicians. Is there anything we, as citizens, can do about this shit? Who do we have to vote in to get some real change on this? Is anyone campaigning on fixing this crap?
Good luck with that. Legault has been explicitly clear during the pandemic. Good number one priority is ~~snuffing out English and immigrants~~ protecting the French language, not trivial things like actually keeping Quebecers alive.
And polls show he's gonna win in a landslide.
Last time I visited Montreal, my ear got infected. My AirBnB host had to drive me to the other side of the island to get to a clinic that would admit me as an out of province patient. There was a hour long wait during which I had to fill out paperwork completely in French. I am far from fluent and found this very confusing. Here in Vancouver, patients can request forms in several languages including French, Tagalog, Arabic, Farsi, Spanish and Vietnamese. When I finally got to see the doctor, she was helpful but didn't speak a word of English, not even basic body parts like "ear". I would love to live in Montreal but as someone struggling to learn French it frightens me that I would struggle to find adequate medical care if I was in an emergency.
yup. there is a shortage of family doctors across canada.    
our government is arrogant enough to think that it can predict how many family doctors we will need next year and for the next 10-20 years.   clearly they have been consistently wrong in the last 10-20 years because here we are with 18+% in bc without a family doctor and 22+% in quebec.  our government is particularly bad at learning from its mistakes when it comes to health care.   
yup. there are rants everywhere. and i'm right there with you.   
also, there are plenty of articles and radio segments that have explored the problem.  i've contacted media outlets directly to ask them to continue keeping the problem current.  there was a time when awareness was the problem.  i don't think it is now. i think it's apathy.   
until recently, our government didn't see a problem with training foreign doctors, knowing that they would leave and never practice in canada.  for many years, canada has spent resources to graduate medical students and NOT ensured that they could enter residency training so they could be licensed and practice in canada.   
my story ?   
i'm a canadian medical graduate.  i live in a semi-rural setting in bc where there is no family doctor.  i've tried for years to enter family medicine residency and i can't even get an interview.  i was good enough to train to get my MD, but evidently NOT good enough to train to open a practice in a province with the second-highest number of people that don't have a family physician.   
the solution?  
just like any household that needs to prioritize and budget, our government has to do the same. primary health care isn't a priority and it needs to be. of course, other things that don't seem to be a priority include: communications infrastructure, education, indigenous rights and reconciliation, energy, etc.  which tells me the solution we need is a new system of government.   the one we have isn't working.
As a young GP that is working hard and signing up hundreds of patients from the waiting list at a time, threads like this are so deflating
C'est poche car je trouve que niveau h√¥pital les choses s'am√©liorent. Les derni√®res fois que des proches ou moi avons eu besoin de soins, les choses se sont pass√© tr√®s bien. Niveau m√©decin de famille c'est effectivement une tr√®s long liste d'attente.
Yeah and the online free system never has any appointments available.  Fun.
Waiting 8hours at the hospital to then get an appointment taken at a clinic by the hospital is the only solution. Fun.
OP, I'm really sorry that you and your family are experiencing this.
Both the CAQ and the PLQ are neoliberal parties who are happy to ruin the healthcare system to make way for privatization. Quebec needs to stop electing them over and over if they want things to start moving in the other direction.
Quebec sucks honestly.
Qu√©bec has a horrible health care system and every time I hear politicians talk about it it "as efficient as it needs to be". They want it privatized and health insurance provided by Desjardins
I'm on year 4 of waiting for a family doctor. Sometimes i look at the original email and laugh:
Currently, in your region, the estimated wait time for persons whose health condition is similar to yours is 359 days from the initial registration date. As soon as a doctor has been assigned to you, he or she will contact you.
Had to register for bonjour sante to get an appointment 2 months ago. Its a shit show.
Le truc avec RVSQ est que toutes les cliniques ouvrent leurs plage horaire √† des heures diff√©rentes, donc en le consultant √† un moment X de la journ√©e il y a peu de chance d'avoir un rendez-vous. L'id√©al est d'appeler la clinique o√π on veut aller et de leur demander √† quelle heure ils ouvrent les rendez-vous et de se connecter √† RVSQ √† cette heure. Ma clinique affiche ses places √† 16:00 pour le lendemain, la derni√®re fois j'ai eu le premier rendez-vous du lendemain matin en me connectant √† 16:01. (Sans m√©decin de famille)
In Playa del Carmen you can see a doctor for 4$ in 5 minutes. Some round trip flights could be cheaper and faster than going through the system
Montreal is a complete and utter embarrassment when it comes to healthcare.I get PTSD just from talking to the receptionist to make appointments, and it only gets worse from here.
It's hard to quantify it exactly, because healthcare is broken in many places in the world (and modern medicine is trash in general for chronic illness), but I put it down as one of the single most negative things in my life growing up in Montreal.
Fucking 4 minute appointments are just enough for them to gaslight you and prove just how ignorant about their own practice, let alone peripherally-related issues.
&#x200B;
Even worse, the private system is just there to collect money from people who don't want to wait; it doesn't actually offer an escape from the public system for health issues that are more complicated.
I just found out that Naturopaths in B.C. are allowed to prescribe certain medications. IN Quebec, it seems like they just you know, prescribe Chamomile tea and flintstones vitamins.
No one campaigns to fix anything here. Look at the number of pharmacies we have on every street corner. Doctors renew prescriptions, they don't do medicine. Find ways to cut the line when available via paid services, or do medical tourism to other provinces and the US.
As long as the Medical College decides how many doctors can be out there nothing will change. It's like the Depaneurs association is the one giving permits for anyone who wants to open one.
the reality is that private clinics are illegal under the health canada act. but politicians want to destroy public healthcare and want us to go back to private, so they've allowed them to flourish despite being technically illegal.  
the problems you're seeing are by design. they are stealing doctors from the public sector, and then giving you as hard a time as possible for using the free services, to drive us to the private sector and eventually drive us to accept the return of american deathcare insurance companies.  
i walked into a CLSC years ago just a half hour after opening. they immediately told me that no one could see me, as the doctor leaves at 1 to go work at the private clinic, and is booked up completely at the CLSC 5 minutes after opening. the receptionist then handed me a photocopied flyer, from a stack for that purpose, listing all the private deathcare clinics in the area and said go there instead. having no choice, i paid $200 for a blood test that should be free.  
what do we need? QS and the NDP to shut the private deathcare industry down and ban all private-public-"partnerships" in healthcare.
Stop financing English universities at 29% because all those doctors leave the province after graduating.
I gave up. Just waiting to leave the country at this point to seek medical help for some of the issues I'm facing.
Took my 2 years to get a family doctor and I have priority since I have a chronic illness. I got one before the pandemic so I'm sure the wait is much longer now.
So I've been struggling with this. I needed to find one and I havent been able to. When I look for doctors on these appointment sites, nothing ends up showing until like October which is insane to me. Even if I put in emergency. I've been avoiding going just because it seems incredibly difficult to do.
Took us 5 years for a family doctor and within 1 year he moved to another province without notice, now we are stuck with a family doctor on our file but no actual doctor to meet with so we cannot even apply for a new one
Pour le m√©decin de famille, le truc c'est de demander directement au m√©decin que tu rencontres en clinique s'il a de la place pour prendre des patients.
C'est comme √ßa que j'ai trouv√© le mien, 3 fois d'affil√© en 10 ans.
I ended up waiting 10+ hours at the ER just to see a doctor and have meds for a minor issue. It's hopeless.
bonne chance pour get un rendez-vous avec RVSQ, c'est d'la caliss de marde
I'm another person who's logged on at 7pm many nights and never had an issue getting an appointment for sometime the next morning in my own neighbourhood. 
I suppose it could be different in different parts of the city, but it definitely works better for me than the old line up and wait non-system. It's not high on my list of things to throw energy at. Sorry.
The family doctor wait, however. And while we have countless medical professionals who have come to Quebec to find their credentials worthless...
Just go to rockland MD, pay 300$ and get served right away. Not sure how busy they are but private clinics are usually quick within a few days, but you pay.
On est en train de chercher aussi une clinique et les derniers qu'on a visit√© ont quasi refus√© de nous voir parce que √ßa concerne la sant√© mentale. C'est l'enfer. On a essay√© l'abonnement √† Bonjour sant√© aussi pour nous faire donner des rencontres de 10 minutes et se faire dire que "ca serait important de prendre soin de soi". Des medecins qui ne veulent pas faire de suivis et rien prescrire.
La seule consolation c'est qu'on a d√©j√† un dossier ouvert dans un CLSC et qu'on a pu parler √† un intervenant plus rapidement.
Je veux faire des plaintes mais jsais pas par o√π commencer, je vais explorer √ßa ce weekend.
Check appointments on rvsq at 8:00am and 5:00pm this is the way.
> On the other hand, getting a family doctor is still impossible in this province. It took my brother 5 years to get one, and my parents are still waiting after 6 years. I've been on the waitlist for 3 and have zero hope of getting one any time soon. Meanwhile my friends in Ontario are getting them within weeks of applying. 
Serious question, what's the reason for this? Is there something akin to the Quebec construction mafia for family doctors?
Try district medical
My family doctor is good but is an hour away from where I live. Apparently I have to give that one up before I can go on a waiting list for one more local to where I now live.... ???
sad but true
Christ, this doesn't give me much hope. I'm currently trying to get an appointment to get a prescription for the antidepressants that I brought with me from my home country (I moved to Canada 6 months ago) and its not going well and I only have a couple weeks worth of pills left. üò´
What gets me is the adult botox babies
Great shot.  What we need is a complete photo essay of all the stone art work and figures on buildings in MTL.
Dommage qu'on ne fasse plus ce type d'art sur les b√¢tisse.. maintenant tout est trop g√©n√©rique.
Correct me if I'm wrong:
Egyptians, Romans, Indians, Native Americans?
Sweet.
saw them the other day! couldnt help but notice their faces are all identical. it‚Äôs sad that they did not show facial structure diversity and instead chose to abide by european beauty standards.

C'est loin d'etre complet, mais il y en a plusieurs dans cette vid√©o: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2WyfGS7xWM&t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2WyfGS7xWM&t=1s)
would be a huge book, lots of it all over the place, just need to open your eyes
Je crois que le seul moyen serait de construire ta propre maison et d'y faire des colonnades en statues.
I think it‚Äôs:  antiquity(Egypt/Rome), British, Eastern (China/India) and American (North American).
You know, the rest didn‚Äôt really count at the turn of the 20th century.
Roman heraldry didn't really have lions, their main thing was the eagle. [That specific style of standing lion in profile is common in European heraldry,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_(heraldry\)) so I think the statue signifies Europe - or maybe "the West".
Third one might be Greek
So it seems, so it seems.
i believe the last two are supposed to represent india and native america. they‚Äôre all clearly white though‚Ä¶
Yes, yes, but some of this type of stone artwork is high up, inaccessible, and obstructed by other buildings, not easily visible from the ground.
Secondly,  all the gargoyles, grotesques, and finer work carved into the stone, or cast into concrete, degrade over time. It would be nice to be able to have a photo record - an anthropological survey of such features before they disappear, are torn down, become damaged, or simple erode away.
Je peux acheter ce building au pire .. haha
Makes way more sense, indeed.
Thanks!
Here the corrected link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_(heraldry)
You're right, that certainly explains the "this feels way more medieval somehow" feeling I had and it seems to fit with the idea that [the statues are more general than just supposed to represent a specific nation.](https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/n80c5x/civilization_statues_on_the_southam_building/gxg712t/)
At first I thought "Scandinavian" because of the attire (she looks like she has braids? And I don't recognize the hat as being particularly Indian looking) but then there's a Buddha on the shield. 
I'm not sure what the three flowers under Buddha are supposed to be tho. As far as I know the national flower of India is the Lotus, so what the hell?
not quite whqt you are looking for but it is a start
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_art_in_Montreal
Dangit! I even switched to the advanced text editor to make it work. Thanks!
I'll have a look at it. Thank you for sharing. I'm considering breaking out my rock climbing gear, rapelling down buildings, and taking pictures of all this largely unseem artwork. 
Cheers, and have a great day.
Backslash to remove formatting, here's how it should look on your side in the editing box:
>\[That specific style of standing lion in profile is common in European heraldry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_(heraldry\))
Gives that:
>[That specific style of standing lion in profile is common in European heraldry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_(heraldry\))
its a colossal task as if you open your eyes you can see some art work on most older buildings in one way or the other. residential, as well.
Ooh thanks for the tip!
On a vraiment une belle ville. On chiale souvent sur Montr√©al, mais c‚Äôest selon moi une des plus belles villes au monde!
Le vieux port est tellement vide sans tous les touristes.
Nice to see it wasn't too crowded.
Sus!!!
C'est moi ou un des  chenille √† trottoir c'est promener avec une fuite d'huile!
Are those chem trails!?!  /S
chemtrails!!!! üòè
Le vieux-port? Whut?
photo 1 c'est le centre-ville et photo 2 c'est le march√© Bonsecours
Jpeux te confirmer qu'il n'√©tait pas vide aujourd'hui en tout cas
Actually it was overpacked today  lol
:O!!!
Lots of chemtrails recently. They sit there from 9 AM to 5 PM no joke. Military planes, with transponder off. Wonder if it's Aluminum (to increase Monsanto GMO seeds and reduce IQ) or some other heavy metal?

definite chemtrails!!!!  üòè
Hey Boy, j'ai quand m√™me mon cours de guide touristique de Montr√©al.
En quoi ce que je dis est faux? Sais-tu o√π es le vieux port?
Edit: le gars m'a dit "va t'eduquer" puis a supprim√© son message...
Not defending him cause obviously he‚Äôs a dick but people in this city have no clue when it cones to old mtl vs old port. It‚Äôs the track people, it‚Äôs the track
It is impossible to post ‚ÄúVieux Port‚Äù on this sub without some pedantic, time wasting, grammar nazi making sarcastic comments and pretending that the entire fucking city doesn‚Äôt use the term ‚ÄúVieux Port‚Äù when going down to that part of the city. 
People say Vieux Port when they mean Vieux Montr√©al. It‚Äôs colloquial. In both languages.
J'avoue que je suis surpris √† chaque fois. Messemble que c'est clair: le vieux-port c'est ce qui √©tait le port!
C'est pas de la grammaire! C'est le nom des lieux! Voyons donc que ma correction te fait r√©agir de m√™me. Si quelqu'un post une photo de l'oratoire Saint-Joseph et √©crit "basilique Notre-Dame", √ßa va te f√¢cher si quelqu'un apporte la correction?
>People say Vieux Port when they mean Vieux Montr√©al
Pas dans mon entourage.
Je vais t'avouer que pour moi, avant que je ne m'int√©resse r√©ellement √† Montr√©al, je disais Vieux-Port pour parler de tout le Vieux-Montr√©al. 
C'est probablement parce que quand on allait au Vieux-Port, on allait sur de la Commune, mais on remontait aussi la Place Jacques-Cartier et Notre-Dame. Le Vieux-Port pis le Vieux-Montr√©al c'√©tait exactement la m√™me chose, pis dans mon entourage, beaucoup de personnes utilisent encore Vieux-Port pour parler de la Place d'Armes.
Ahhhhhh vieux-port....tu veux dire que c‚Äô√©tait un vrai port avant??
Je comprends, comme les gens qui pensent qu'ils sont dans le mile-end quand ils sont √† la banquise!
√áa en surprend plusieurs ;)
Ce genre de personnes existe vraiment?
Il y a des gens vraiment pas bons avec la g√©ographie. Ma soeur disait aux gens que j'habitais dans hochealg quand jetais sur masson!
Ma soeur pensait que le lac Saint-Jean √©tait √† Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu !
Du racisme dans la police ??? 
En voil√† une surprise !
>Content told them that he was recording to ‚Äúprotect his human rights,‚Äù and the officers used a sarcastic tone to mock him. As the officers were driving away, Content said ‚Äúbitch‚Äù out of exasperation. A week later, he received in the mail a $77 ticket for having insulted a police officer during the ‚Äúexercise of his functions.‚Äù
Pour ceux qui se demandaient c'√©tait quoi du racisme syst√©mique, ben c'est √ßa.

Fucking snowflakes
En l'occurence, c'est pas du tout du racisme syst√©mique. C'est du racisme.   
Le racisme syst√©mique, c'est quand m√™me des gens qui ne sont pas racistes infligent √† un ou plusieurs groupes des exp√©riences n√©gatives et p√©nalisantes parce que le syst√®me est b√¢ti d'une certaine fa√ßon.
Pour ceux qui se demandaient c'est quoi des policiers pogo, ben c'est √ßa.
Systematic racism: a form of racism that is embedded as normal practice within society or an organization.
The fact that this man was able to win his case proves that racism isn't tolerated in our society. There are laws in place to protect everyone here, so what we have is not systematic racism, but racist people here and there.
The only form of systematic racism i would agree exists here in Canada is systematic racism against indigenous people.
C'est quoi le "racisme syst√©mique" pour toi?
EDIT:
Le d√©bat si c'est du racisme syst√©mique ou non est compl√®tement stupide si la d√©finition de "racisme syst√©mique" est diff√©rente pour tout le monde.
SJW: "C'est du racisme JIOSUDSUIDYUSD"
Moi: "C'est quoi pour toi du racisme JIOSUDSUIDYUSD"
SJW: "T'encule des mouches √† vouloir d√©finir les mots qui sortent de ma bouche"
It's about frequency.

What?
If that's what you get out of this story then you completely missed the point.
Content pas content.
Le racisme syst√©mique c'est tr√®s simple selon moi. C'est quand une institution publique, par ses actions ou inactions, g√©n√®re, encourage, laisse perdurer, ignore volontairement ou involontairement, les actions de ses membres qui ont pour cons√©quences d'opprimer des groupes stigmatis√©s. Renfor√ßant par le fait m√™me les st√©r√©otypes d'oppresseurs - oppress√©s. 
Et tout le noeud ici tient dans institution PUBLIQUE. Non pas que le priv√© n'a pas un r√¥le √† jouer, mais c'est plut√¥t le fait que les ressources de l'√©tat ne devraient en aucun cas servir √† opprimer les plus faibles, mais bien les prot√©ger. Il en va de la confiance qu'on porte aux institutions √©tatiques.
> c'est pas du tout du racisme syst√©mique. C'est du racisme.
That's a line people keep using all over the world to defend bad institutions and allow them to continue to be bad. 
You think it's a coincidence that our police keep getting found guilty of racial profiling? At a certain point, any system that allows that many racists to work within it without reforming them or weeding them out is systemically racist. 
Blaming the individuals only just lets the racism continue into the next generation.
On est en 2020, wake up, le terme "racisme" n'existe plus, il faut dire "racisme syst√©mique".
Faut suivre un peu tabarnak.
According to your definition it's either society or an organization. Society doesn't tolerate it but the organization (spvl) does.
Systemic is not the same as systematic
Pour une personne de la population, la d√©finition d'√™tre en sant√© est d'avoir un IMC de moins de 26.
Pour une autre, c'est de pouvoir courir 10 minutes sans manquer de souffle.
On devrait fermer la discussion des facteurs nuisibles √† la sant√© car les d√©finitions que les gens ont du concept de 'sant√©' diff√®rent l√©g√®rement.
S√©rieux jouer sur la s√©mantique √† ce point l√† c'est essayer d'ajouter des couches de complexit√© inutiles pour encourager √† rester et se complaire dans le status quo. C'est dense et √ßa aide personne.

¬´ Le racisme syst√©mique, parce qu‚Äôil est plus insidieux, peut √™tre plus difficile √† percevoir. [La Commission des droits de la personne et de la jeunesse (CDPDJ)](http://www.cdpdj.qc.ca/Publications/memoire_OCPM_racisme-systemique.pdf)  le d√©finit ¬´¬†comme la somme d‚Äôeffets d‚Äôexclusion disproportionn√©s qui  r√©sultent de l‚Äôeffet conjugu√© d‚Äôattitudes empreintes de pr√©jug√©s et de  st√©r√©otypes, souvent inconscients, et de politiques et pratiques  g√©n√©ralement adopt√©es sans tenir compte des caract√©ristiques des membres  de groupes vis√©s par l‚Äôinterdiction de la discrimination.¬†¬ª (p. 6).  Malgr√© son caract√®re parfois involontaire, cette forme de racisme a pour  effet de perp√©tuer les in√©galit√©s v√©cues par les personnes racis√©es  notamment en mati√®re d‚Äô√©ducation, de revenus, d‚Äôemploi, d‚Äôacc√®s au  logement et aux services publics. ¬ª
Je crois que [cette page](https://iris-recherche.qc.ca/blogue/qu-est-ce-que-le-racisme-systemique) de l'IRIS explique bien et donne en plus des exemples plus concrets.
What‚Äôs the frequency rate then
And when does it cross the line where u can claim racism

Ce que tu dis est tout √† fait vrai. Et le fait que les policiers soient encore √† l'emploi est un √©l√©ment de racisme syst√©mique.   
Mais le fait divers pr√©sent√© ici n'est pas un exemple de racisme syst√©mique. C'est un exemple de racisme.
> C'est quand une institution publique, par ses actions ou inactions, **g√©n√®re**, **encourage**, **laisse perdurer**, **ignore volontairement** ou **involontairement**, les actions de ses membres qui ont pour cons√©quences d'opprimer des groupes stigmatis√©s.
Donc n'importe quelle institution publique qui "ignore involontairement" des actes de racismes ont un probl√®me de racisme syst√©mique. 
Donc, les biblioth√®ques du Qu√©bec ont un probl√®me de racisme syst√©mique parce qu'ils ignorent que Jean le commis est raciste.
Par ta d√©finition large et boiteuse, tous les institutions publiques font preuve de racisme syst√©mique. On se calme le SJW.
That wasn't a defense at all. 
And yes, I agree, the fact that those cops keeps being cops instead of being fired is systemic racism. 
But what they did wasn't systemic racism. It was pure racism. And I don't understand how you could interpret this as a some sort of defense.
It can be argued that yes, but the spvl-m are part of the government and the government has made law against it.
Care to explain the difference? Seems like every thing i find online uses the terms interchangeably.
En effet, si tu veux discuter avec un groupe de personne si X est "en sant√©" ou non, il faut en premier d√©finir ce qu'est "en sant√©". Sinon √ßa sert √† rien et c'est une perte de temps. C'est la base d'une discussion et d'un d√©bat. 
Tu fais juste prouver mon point.

Getting a fine for saying bitch is bad itself. Now this guy wouldn't have gotten a fine if he was white, which makes this racism. It's also why he won the case. Did you read the article?
j'y √©tais hier soir aussi! il a fait tellement beau. j'√©tais le plus impressionn√©e par le jardin japonais, o√π ils utilisent de la lumi√®re sur les arbres, tout simplement. j'aimais aussi les transitions entre les jardins. je m'attendais √† plus d'artistes, par exemple; il n'y en a eu qu'un seul!
Une chose que j'aurais aim√© savoir c'est que, m√™me si tu prends un billet √† 21h30, tu peux rester apr√®s 22h. Leur site dit qu'ils ferment √† 22h mais c'est juste la fermeture de la queue pour entrer.
Fumez avant mais prenez pas d'acide/shrooms lol y'a trop de stimuli et surtout trop de monde pour t'assurer d'un bon trip
Si vous n'√™tes pas all√© au Tonga Lumina (Mt. Tremblant) ou Foresta Lumina (Coaticook, pas loin de Sherbrooke), je les conseille encore plus
J'√©tais l√† aujourd'hui √† 10am, c'√©tait beau, mais crissement moins beau que le soir!
Some weird digital artifact going on with the stadium.
I'm picturing this shot without the stadium and think it would be better without it.  I find it takes away and distracts from the vibrant colors and natural setting.  To me, this picture should be about the colorful lights and the contrast with the dark, not the tower in the background
Est-ce que c'est moi ou c'est toujours la m√™me exposition depuis 20 ans ? Je me souviens d'avoir pris les m√™mes trucs en photo avec un HP 3MP avec une lentille en plastique lol !

Bonjour! I‚Äôm visiting your lovely city in December and the botanical garden is on my tentative list of stops‚Ä¶ how is it in the winter in the snow? Merci in advance
On est all√© cet √©t√© pis c'√©tait cool, mais l√† tu viens de me donner le go√ªt d'y aller le soir!
It looks nicer than when I was there in May 2019.
Ils vont rester combien de temps ?
J‚Äôai eu l‚Äôimpression de voir la m√™me chose les 4 derni√®res ann√©es. Et cette ann√©e bien qu‚Äôils ont ajout√©s des lumi√®res dans le jardin des premi√®res nation pour le rendre plus attrayant je trouve que c‚Äôest un peu sur√©valu√© avec les √©ditions tous les ans qui se ressemblent. Je trouve la sortie √† 50$ pour 2 adultes et 2 enfants  un peu cher pour le parcours. Je suis peut-√™tre devenu plus difficilement impressionn√© ou juste plus critique.
C‚Äôest un peu comme quand tu vas voir tes parents  apr√®s un long moment. ‚ÄúAh tu as chang√© la disposition du salon!!! C‚Äôest bien. √Ä la prochaine ‚Äú
Les batiments on √©t√© refait il y a 4 ans via un partenaria Chino-Canadien! Malgr√© que les designs sont les m√™mes qu'√† l'origine, l'√©clairage met un accent particulier sur les d√©tails de l'architecture Chinoise et des s√©quences d'√©clairage √† la "moment factory" ont √©t√© fait √† quelque endroit dans le jardin de Chine. Ceci √©tant dit il y a un petit roulement des structures en papier mais la plus part revienne d'ann√©e en ann√©e! Source : je suis l'√©lectricien qui a fait les travaux √©lectrique du Jardin de chine.
L‚Äôexposition en temps que tel ne change pas (le th√®me est le m√™me vu qu‚Äôil va avec les b√¢timents pr√©sents). Mais ce qui la constitue change un peu d‚Äôann√©e en ann√©e au fil et √† mesure du temps. Y aller √† chaque ann√©e n‚Äôa peut √™tre pas un grand int√©r√™t pour la majorit√© des personnes mais une fois au 5 ans √ßa commence √† √™tre int√©ressant. En plus cette ann√©es ils ont fait plus de jeux de lumi√®re un peu partout sur le terrain du jardin botanique.
Ils ont ajout√© un parcours dans les jardins japonais et des premi√®res nations. OP montre seulement la partie du jardin chinois, mais √ßa repr√©sente seulement 1/3 du parcours. La partie dans le jardin des premi√®res nations est vraiment magnifique, mais c'est plus des jeux de lumi√®re immersifs que des laternes.
Absolutely! And that was taken with my iPhone (in raw, but still). We‚Äôve come a long way
I don't know when you went, but that's not a permanent exhibit. https://calendrier.espacepourlavie.ca/jardins-de-lumiere-926006 Sept 3rd to Oct 31
It‚Äôs the jardin de lumi√®res, they do it every year from September to the end of October.
This exposition, Jardin de lumi√®re, is only until October 31. But they‚Äôre still they‚Äôre all winter and it‚Äôs still very nice. Personally I love going to it from time to time, it‚Äôs really a nice place to visit^^
fin octobre
Oh amazing thanks! I will go this weekend
Yeah they do it every year. I've gone several times when I first moved here as a kid in 2006.
F√©licitations! Tu as tout mon respect.
Je me suis fait agress√© physiquement au mois de novembre dernier par un enrag√© au volant. J'ai d√ª appeler de temps en temps pour avoir un suivi.
N'ait pas peur d'appeler et demander un suivi et √† savoir si √ßa pregresse et quelles sont les prochaines √©tapes dans le processus.
Bon courage!
Hi! As a fellow child-abuse survivor, thank you for coming forth about this, even at a much later date. I know I'm nobody in particular, but je suis fi√®re de toi.

As-tu demand√© un suivi sur ton dossier ?
F√©licitations pour ta d√©nonciation et mes sympathies pour ce qui t‚Äôes arriv√©. Pense aussi √† faire une demande √† l‚ÄôIVAC pour √™tre indemnis√©.e. Si l‚Äôacte criminel a eu lieu au Qu√©bec, tu pourrais recevoir un soutien financier/de la psychoth√©rapie, etc.
 Voici le site https://www.ivac.qc.ca/en/Pages/default.aspx
This is awesome. 
J'admire ton courage!
Courage! 
Sur une autre note, f√©licitation pour ton fran√ßais √©crit tu te d√©brouilles plus que bien.
https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/kleop2/avis_pour_faire_une_plainte_au_spvm_pour_une/
Courage et f√©licitations!
Voici comment je pense que √ßa fonctionne au meilleur de mes connaissances....
Les agents prennent la plainte, ils font ensuite rapport au d√©tective. Le d√©tective enqu√™te par la suite. Du fait que √ßa fait longtemps, ils sont probablement en train de v√©rifier ce qui est la preuve. Plus c'est long, plus c'est p√©nible, je sais. Les agents t'ont probablement remis leur carte, v√©rifie avec eux...
La prochaine √©tape et de monter le dossier pour le procureur. C'est lui ou elle qui va d√©cider de porter plainte contre ton agresseur. C'est important pour le sergent d√©tective de bien monter son dossier pour s'assurer que c'est pas un arr√™t de proc√©dure direct pour manque de preuve.
Ensuite c'est la mis en accusation devant le juge, il y a plusieurs √©tapes et √ßa peut aussi √™tre long. Je m'y connais tr√®s mal dans ce genre de proc√®s, mais te donner une id√©e, j'ai port√© plainte contre mon ex septembre dernier, j'ai des nouvelles de mani√®re tr√®s tr√®s sommaire, il passait √† la cour le 25 mai, pas eu de nouvelles, le proc√®s sera probablement en septembre, et ils ont proc√©d√© par accusation sommaire, ce qui est suppos√© √™tre plus rapide (1 an!) 
√áa va √™tre long, √ßa va √™tre probablement difficile, il faut regarder en avant et se dire que c'est la bonne chose que tu as fait. Pour toi, pour les autres qui n'ont pas ton courage, pour ceux que √ßa pourrait inspirer et pour la pr√©vention. 
Je suis derri√®re toi, je te cheer virtuel et j'esp√®re de ton mon c≈ìur que tu auras la paix d'esprit avec la d√©marche.
Good show - you are brave!
Bravo! J‚Äôesp√®re que tu vas avoir des nouvelles bient√¥t
Selon moi, Vu que ce crime s'est pass√© il y a longtemps et qu'il s'agit seulement de l'agression sexuelle ( cest grave de l'agression sexuelle mais elle ne semble pas √™tre prioris√© par la police), √ßa risque de prendre plus que 6 mois pour qu'ils te reviennent l√† dessus. En tout cas c'est le temps que √ßa leur a prit pour commencer l'enqu√™te sur mon Zoom bombing.
Bravo pour ton courage! Aie patience les d√©marches peuvent √™tre longues, tu as tout mon support :)
Bonne chance
Je ferais un suivi, mais ca peut √™tre long. J'ai d√©j√† eu un scooter de vol√© et √ßa leur a pris 6 mois apr√®s l'avoir avant de me contacter. Mais d√©finitivement, pour en avoir le coeur net, tu peux faire un follow up
Bravo d'avoir fait ce pas, je n'imagine pas √† quel point c'√©tait difficile de le faire. Mais f√©licitations, et respect!!
Courage!
Merci et je suis tr√®s d√©sol√© d‚Äôentendre c‚Äôest que t‚Äôas v√©cu.
I‚Äôm doing this because I know that there are others out there. The fact that I found 2 others is what really pushed me to do this.
Out of curiosity did you ever decide to move forward?
J‚Äôai envoy√© un courriel √ßa fait deux semaines environs. Ils m‚Äôont reponder pour dire sans nouvelles.
Oui merci j‚Äôai envoy√© un courriel tr√®s relax genre passive mise √† jour. Ils m‚Äôont r√©pondu que pas des nouvelles.
Merci. La police m‚Äôavais r√©f√©r√© mais j‚Äôai pas la courage pour proc√©d√© avec eux pour l‚Äôinstant.
√áa prenais presque 10 ans de finalement faire √ßa.
Merci. Meilleur fa√ßon √† essay√© de ma√Ætriser c‚Äôest de m‚Äôimmerger.
Merci de poster pour les autres
Ok et merci pour √ßa. Car que j‚Äôai deux autres hommes j‚Äôai trouv√© ET j‚Äôai donner leur noms et num√©ros est ce que √ßa aide? √áa l‚Äôair qu‚Äôils on m√™me pas appel√© les deux autres hommes aussi.
Thank you. I have had some support and the hardest part, I believe, has been done.
Positive Nectarine indeed üòÄ
Merci. J‚Äôai faite un nouveau post
C'est r√©ciproque. Je te souhaite de retrouver la paix assez rapidement avec ce qui t'es arriv√©.
Hi! Sorry, I didn't see this reply until now. Actually, yes - something like 5 years later. I randomly called the 911 line one day and explained my situation. They sent a cop car over and he took all the notes that I had to say, asked me questions, etc. They were very understanding and very soft. It could be because I was nervous about it all (understandably so), but they weren't harsh at all.
Il faut les talonner. Demande des suivis √† chaque mois. La police peut √™tre aussi bureaucratique que des fonctionnaires, parfois.
C'est un bon d√©part! Est-ce qu'ils savent o√π il est? Est-ce que les agents t'ont expliqu√© la d√©marche? C'est peut-√™tre bloqu√© l√†... ils le recherchent pour lui poser des questions, o√π ils accumulent le plus de preuve possible. J'aimerais t'en donner plus, te rassurer, le criminel n'est pas ma tasse de th√©, je fais juste te donner comment √ßa s'est pass√© pour moi et une amie avec qui j'√©tais pour sa plainte, c'√©tait similaire...
Est ce qu‚Äôil y a une mise √† jour pour vous?
Thanks for sharing. How long did it take after that date to end up to speak with a detective?
Tu pense que chaque mois marche? C‚Äôest pas trop souvent? Faites une appelle o√π par courriel?
It is sad that this might be the way to go.
Ah ben oui!
J'ai re√ßu un papier √† remplir. Une d√©claration de la victime pour d√©crire les dommages que j'ai souffert suite √† mon agression.
Il y a une premi√®re date qui m'a √©t√© donn√© par le procureur. Je crois que √ßa concerne l'agresseur.
En tout cas √ßa avance.
Honestly, I don't remember. I have a vague recollection of talking to someone after the fact, maybe within a week back then, but it's been more than ten years since this occurred, and so the follow up could be a fabricated memory. Sorry!
Je ne sais pas si √ßa marche, honn√™tement. Mais il faut pers√©v√©rer.
https://montreal.ca/en/topics/birds-and-other-wild-animals
> In Montr√©al, feeding wild animals is strictly prohibited so that they don‚Äôt become accustomed to humans and lose their independence.
It's too late for these racoons all the tourist feed them. Every time I go there there's at least 20 racoons all around looking for food and there not shy about it. Funny how it's ok to put cat shelter and cat food in an alley on the plateau but feeding racoons is wrong.
IMO that lady must be very lonely so let her be or be nice to her but don't you dare call the cops.
Un ami a parl√©  √† cette madame il y a quelque temps, on la surnomme "la racoon lady". Elle est l√† depuis des ann√©es, elle dit qu'ils ont tous des nom, mais que seulment 5 sont √† elle et elle vie avec ces 5.Elle est quand m√™me souvent l√†. Mais les raton eu, ils sont toujours l√† !
That's a big nope. Totally forbidden.
It‚Äôs not legal but it‚Äôs like the 10th generation of trash Panda that live like that so I wouldn‚Äôt be impressed to learn that this place is where they find 90% of their calories
No one's coming around judging you on how you make friends you know
The woman on the picture tonight took couple of raccoon's in her arms and hugged them and pet them. I was shocked how comfortable she was with them. As you can next to her on the picture, she had a big bucket with food inside she gave to them.
People who do this are turning wild animals into pets who will no longer be able to fend for themselves for ever be dependent on humand, who, in the absence of humans, will just end up dying.
If you really love animals, **leave them alone and observe them from afar.**
√áa c'est des gros ratons!
At most they would get a fine, but it's neither legal nor ok
This is illegal.
She must be stop, because the raccoon around there will become more acclimate to us and it can become a very big problem in the future ; they will expect we will give them foods at any time they would cross our path and if we not comply, it can create hostile reactions from them toward us.
Feeding wildlife of any species is a bad thing.
They will start approaching everybody expecting the same result.
They could hurt somebody or be hurt/killed by someone who isn't as comfortable with them.
Bad move all around.
Plus, it's prohibited for that reason.
Not legal but many people feel very lonely and feed urban animals to cope, fining them would seem very unjust.
No it's not, we all remember this infamous rant about feeding the squirrels https://youtu.be/0LMXOPMjeY0
Man some people are just ‚Ä¶ so lonely üôÉ
they carry diseases such as rabies, illegal or not.. je ne le recommande pas du tout!
Racoons have rabbies... stay away
nope, but people still do them anyway cause they think they are being cute
This is how you catch rabies.
I know a Disney princesse when i see one at the Start of the movies...
Not supposed too .... but good karma..
My ex wife used, to that.
wtf nonononono!
Narc
She's going through something for sure
I've been there like 2 times. Everytime it's filled with people bringing snacks and I don't really bother for that part because it's all they know already. 
 What is bothering me is, they give bread, chips, candies and shitty snacks like that. I'm the only one bringing water bottles (they know how to drink with it and it's actually cute), fruits and vegetables. There was babies climbing my legs and stealing fruits in my hoodie pocket lol. They're cute af but don't forget to wash your hands before and after. Keep a spare water bottle and soap. They're wild animals and probably have a fuckton of diseases. Ah and watch your fingers, you don't want to get bite by a wild animal. :) 
Last tips: Don't try to pet them, don't force them to approach. They'll come to you If they want. They might been docile, that doesn't mean it isn't stressing them. Peace!
Man are they getting bigger ?
The decision you made of taking a picture of a homeless person to post it on Reddit and asking about the legality of their behaviour feels quite spineless and pathetic. Everyone knows, even kids, that feeding wild animals in general is prohibited, so what is the point of your post ? Maybe you could try to contribute in a positive way to your city instead of snitching on homeless people. Garbage behaviour.
Never feed any wild animals, period.
Shut up dawg
It's legal to mind your own business üëç
Don‚Äôt be a narc about it.
She feedin frens
we don't want interactions with humans. Feeding them is dumb before it is something illegal.
Raccoons? Looks like a family of bears. Didn‚Äôt know they were that friendly here.
Got nothing better to do?
I don't see any arm in it, human law is not always a road to morality
It's not legal but do it anyways
STOP SNITCHING
Quick, we need a Karen here stat!
You really think Montr√©al have an army of raccoon with rabies in one of the most touristic spot? If it was the case they would storm mont Royal and euthanized all of the trash panda. Can't let tourist catch rabies üòÇ
They Aren't wild animal If they feed themselves in dumpster. And if humans would stop feeding them, it wouldn't be good as they have no natural habitat or ressources in the city. But let's only snitch on an old lady bringing cat food to those raccoons that are preparing for a rough winter!
Don't be a snitch bro. Raccoons are cute, it's not like she's feeding bears.
Pour quoi pas?
Mind your own damn business
Don‚Äôt you have better things to do than to mind her business regarding if it‚Äôs legal to feed animals..?
Snitch
No, Karen, it‚Äôs almost certainly illegal to feed the raccoons.
That said, Karen, maybe mind your own business.
Why are you snitching? Get a better hobby.
People seriously need to stop taking unauthorized pictures and videos of people without their consent with their mobile devices. How creepy would it have been for folks to take pictures of random folks and have them developped. The cell phone doesn't change that. If the person doesn't give clear permission this should be a violation of the right to privacy.
Compared to the record-breaking heat out West, I'll take this anytime. I'm loving this weather
J‚Äôai froid. 
Je porte mes vetements d‚Äôautomne‚Ä¶
Osti quon etait ben
La journ√©e que je d√©cide d'aller aux glissades d'eau..
I wonder if it's linked to climate change, since climate change doesn't affect every place the same way. Most of last summer felt more cold than usual to me, as well.
Le vent a enlev√© toute l'humidit√©.
&#x200B;
Belle temp√©rature pour faire le D√©fi M√©tropolitain ( √† part le vent)
I'm surprised the record is that high.
WE SOLVED CLIMATE CHANGE, PEOPLE!!! üôå
I hope this trend continues as I‚Äôll be there next week.
Felt a lot cooler than that, I had to put on jeans + longsleeve shirt + a fall jacket to stay warm
welcome to the effects of global warming :)
I love your posts. That's all I have to say. Thanks
üé∂There it is again, that funny feelingüé∂
Il a fait une soir√©e automnale en fra√Æcheur certain.
La temp√©rature parfaite. J‚Äôaimerais qu‚Äôelle dure √† l‚Äôann√©e longue!
As someone currently in 35+ degree weather, PLEASE SWAP WITH ME.
With 40¬∞C I'll trade you.
Funny how everyone seems to have forgotten our early spring this year, how it was 20 degrees in mid-March
It was so cold ..... I saw a squirrel blowing on his nuts.
Alberta has been a heat dome (all of western Canada). No significant rain for weeks. Fucking Kenney is crazy and removed all covid restrictions. It‚Äôs literally Hell. Sauvez-nous!
I love these posts I was actually looking for it because today I feel kinda ‚Äúfunny‚Äù. It might be this change in temperature?? I noticed from yesterday it got colder outside and I had a heavy workout I feel extra weaker than usual üò≥ I don‚Äôt know if I have covid but I‚Äôm handling it at home as if I do. Just to be safe and monitor my symptoms daily
Wanna know something? If we extract data, there are no significant correlation that the earth is getting warmer (global warming), at least on a statistical perspective.
Same here. I prefer 20C over 35C+humidex.
it's almost like a peltier cooler lol.
I think im one of the few ones that would be happier with 30+ degree weather.
I have $#@@% hated this summer's weather.
Est-tu ben dans ton coton-ouat√©?
J'ai mis une jupe et un crop top pour sortir ü•∂ü•∂ü•∂
Ouais, je devais trouver aussi mes vetements chauds, surtout hier!
Ouain bof lol. J‚Äôai commenc√© la journ√©e en short pis t-shirt. J‚Äôaidais mon p√®re sur un chantier. Pis juste quand jsuis rentr√© j‚Äôai re√ßu un appel de mon fr√®re qui s‚Äôest coup√© le doigt et devait aller √† l‚Äôurgence. J‚Äôai pas pens√© √† me changer. Asti j‚Äôavais l‚Äôair cave en fumant mes smokes ds lfrette en attendant mon fr√®re. On est arriv√© aux urgences √† 8pm on est revenu a 5am aujourd‚Äôhui maudit. Tout √ßa pour 5 points de suture‚Ä¶.
Edit: autocorrect qui change asti en as-tu
Moi c‚Äôest demain, 16 degr√©s max, 70% de pluie.
Ouch!
Les changements climatiques vont causer des variations importantes et plus r√©guli√®res. Par exemple, une canicule une semaine suivi de temp√©ratures basses avec des orages/temp√™tes importantes entre les deux. C'est pas mal pour √ßa que nos voisins ont autant de tornades. 
C'est ma compr√©hension du ph√©nom√®ne, je peux me tromper.
So, yes it is. The heat domes in western North America are basically sucking our hot air away from us rn. Super scary to me honestly. We are basically suffering from human created weather patterns now both here and there. 
https://www.meteomedia.com/ca/nouvelles/article/lete-deregle-le-quebec-vit-une-premiere-en-pres-de-50-ans
on appelle √ßa des extr√™mes de temp√©rature, chose naturelle qui arrive.
It is.
If you look at how the 'heat dome' out West is pushing hot air further north, cooler air is coming East.
Sorry but this kind of low temperature is not the first time.
Looking at the historical weather data will give you an idea that in July it happened it's not that rare. 2009 is one that comes to mind.
Climate change is bullshit. Geo-engineering is what is happening right now to make us believe in climate change. 
We are getting sprayed day and night heavy metals and chemicals over our heads (aluminum, barium and strontium to name a few). This creates a layer of micro particles that traps green house gases. 
Yes, chem trails exist and nothing is done about it.
Climate change is not making Montreal colder.
WE DID IT REDDIT
yeah let's all cancel our summer for this one tourist guys
It's kind of normal, the human body adjusts to temperatures quite a bit within a few weeks, so a cold front in summer will feel colder than it is. 
And if your place is overheated in winter and you telework/are inside a lot, you have a harder time with harsh cold temperatures outside. Etc.
C'√©tait plut√¥t la pleine lune.
Change global warming for geo-engineering to make us believe it's climate change and you'll be right.
Thanks.  It's a lot of work, but it's nice to hear that people enjoy them.
Eh? We are exceeding the 1.5 C bar likely in 5 years. Where do you get your data!
I disagree.  I have seen (and produced) lots of evidence (from a statistical perspective) that many parts of the world (including Montreal) are getting warmer.
Global warming doesn't mean that temperature only increase. You get both extremes hot and cold
Room temperature is more comfortable than being afraid you might die of heatstroke if your AC fails, yes. 
Somehow that opinion is controversial to some still haha.
I really shouldn't have to put on a jacket/sweater on during summer. I'd gladly take the 35C
Ouch
Pour moi, Montr√©al c'est un peu la ville parfaite si tu recherches une exp√©rience de grande ville en Am√©rique du Nord sans vouloir habiter dans une m√©galopole ou une ville qui est car-centric, genre Los Angeles. On a un vrai centre-ville, des quartiers centraux (concentr√©s autour de la ligne orange) qui ont tous une vraie singularit√©, beaucoup d'espaces verts, une sc√®ne socio-culturelle de niveau mondial, un r√©seau de transports d√©j√† pas pire qui va avoir une belle upgrade dans les cinq prochaines ann√©es, etc.. Y'a tout ce qu'il faut pour s'√©tablir et bien vivre ici - m√™me si y'a aussi bien des probl√®mes (crise de l'immobillier, traffic, construction, etc.).
Le seul d√©faut de Montr√©al par rapport √† ce que je recherche personellement, apr√®s avoir pas mal voyag√© et habit√© en Europe, c'est que le Qu√©bec, et l'Am√©rique du Nord en g√©n√©ral, c'est gros en osti. Y'a plein de beaux coins au Qu√©bec, mais c'est aussi et surtout du bois, longtemps. Il y a des villes europ√©ennes qui offrent quelque chose de similaire √† Montr√©al, genre Barcelone, mais qui profitent aussi de la proximit√© d'autres grandes villes europ√©ennes, de climats et de topographies plus vari√©s, et de r√©seaux ferroviaires et a√©riens qui changent la game en terme d'acc√®s, de tourisme, d'√©changes culturels.
Reste que d√®s qu'on me parle de Montr√©al √† l'√©tranger, c'est mon premier paragraphe qui ressort.
I buy Montreal-themed art by local artists on Etsy to show my love of this city. I want to buy all the art but I also don't want my apartment to look like a Montreal museum so I have to stop. üòÇ
I came here 8 years ago and it was like one last outpost that hadn't been completely messed up by neoliberalism. Independent business owners, reasonable house prices, not a utopia but not near dystopia either.
I'm a bit worried about what's to come. Land prices are creeping up, covid is going to make life very hard for independents (if they didn't go bust already). Put the two together and larger businesses could sweep up most commercial space if we ever get back to normal. On the residential side landlords now make more than workers, rentals are harder to find and airbnb predominates, while our politicians sit on their hands.
I really, really like Montreal, now I'm worried that my young kids are going to have the same shit life they would have had in the UK by the time they come of age. Fingers crossed this won't happen.
Just be wary that people who constantly talk about one subject tend to get annoying. I like Montr√©al but let's not make it a religion.
I‚Äôm a born and raised Montrealer and I find myself doing the same thing. I don‚Äôt get when people say they want to move to another city but that‚Äôs just me ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
It‚Äôs the perfect middle between not too big and not too small

I grew up here then left for Toronto for 6 yrs and I‚Äôm back now. I love this city. It‚Äôs been a fucked up ride üòÖ
It‚Äôs the city I happen to live in, nothing more nothing less. It coulda been anywhere else in the world and I‚Äôd likely still have the same thought; meh
It ain‚Äôt paradise, it ain‚Äôt utopia.
I absolutely love Montreal too. I have Montreal scenery framed in my house, I am constantly researching about different neighborhoods, reading on our latest news. There's no other city I'd rather live in.
i'm originally from ontario.   
my husband's job took us abroad and we lived there for 12 years.    
we lived in japan, frankfurt, boston, dunedin (NZ) and munich.    
we finally were able to find a job for him in montreal.  montreal was everything i was hoping for, european flair, but still "home".    
we've been living here for almost 3 years now and i'm so happy that my gut was right.  
i could never move back to ontario.  we go back to visit family, but i'm much happier in montreal than i would be there, i think.  i see montreal as having the best opportunities for my children.  i prefer the CEGEP system and i like how it is bilingual here.  if we had not settled in montreal, we would never have been able to afford a home. i know that is changing now, but for us, we were able to finally purchase our first home in our 40s!    
as you said, montreal is not perfect, but the benefits outweigh the negatives for our family and i really like it here.
I'm born and raised in this city (all over it).
I've travelled to many places and worked closely with people from around the world.
I not only love the city (architecture, nature, food, businesses, etc.) I truly love its people. I love the orderly way people go about their lives while not following the rules.
There is a mix of culture here and Montreal seems to bring out the best in all of them.
I have yet to find another city that has such an emotional impact on me.
I am not born n raised in Montreal but I absolutely adore the city , have lived in big cities across 3 continents and Montreal is my favourite city .
I am from Toronto and I would never move back. It‚Äôs such a livable charming city.
If montreal has million number of fans i am one of them üôãüèª. if montreal has ten fans i am one of them. if montreal have only one fan and that is me üôãüèºüôãüèΩüôãüèæ. if montreal has no fans, that means i am no more on the earth üò¢. if world against the montreal, i am against the world ‚ùåüåç‚òÑÔ∏è. i love #montreal till my last breath.. üòç .. Die Hard fan of montreal ü§ìüåπ. Hit Like If you Think montreal Best city & Smart In the world ü§†
Not born here but I absolutely love Montreal and Montrealers!
Never seen a city sub love themselves so much.
Tu n'es pas seul.
I mean...I get it but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a great city...not even close. The traffic sucks, the roads are shit, it‚Äôs dirty, it‚Äôs full of meth heads and homeless people, it‚Äôs cold af 8 months out of the year, parks are not well maintained, the food scene is average, the city scalps you for a monthly metro pass, constantly under construction, etc I could keep going on and on.
I‚Äôll probably get downvoted but i‚Äôm sorry...i‚Äôve lived in 5 different countries and had the privilege of travelling immensely for someone who‚Äôs only in their early twenties, and there are at least a dozen cities I can think of that have better food, a more interesting history, cleaner, nicer people, more things to do, and way way way prettier in just about every aspect.
Is it a fun and good looking city? Yes. Is there something to get excited about? Imo no. But hey, we all have assholes and we all have opinions.
Edit: I would stand by the claim that Montreal is an amazing city relative to what North America has to offer. But my standards are more broad than that which is why I seem so critical.
I travel the world. Worked in difference provinces for years. Born and raised in montreal. 
 This city can drive me nuts (pot holes, construction in downtown that never ends, cyclist lanes, etc...) but for some reason but I just can't stop loving the city. 
Something about it.
I moved to San Francisco and my roommate also is from Montreal. When we hangout with friends, I have to stop ourselves from raving on and on about how great Montreal is.
I actually thought I had an embellished perception of Montreal because I mostly remember the good parts, but glad to hear it's not just me.
Been living for three months in Montr√©al. I can guarantee that I will forever love this city!
I love Montreal. I‚Äôm American with Canadian PR. But Montreal is so fricking quirky and weird sometimes. I‚Äôm not a Francophile I just love the people, love the weather, and love the city and the food.
Montrealer living in Alberta here. I‚Äôm pretty sure everyone around me is sick of hearing me compare things to how they are back home. I can‚Äôt help it!! My mouth just opens and ‚Äúin montreal....‚Äù come right out! I loved it the entirety of my life living there and now that I‚Äôm gone and can look at it from the outside, I love it even MORE!!
I would be if it wasn‚Äôt so full of racism
Edit: 
Anyone of the white folks downvoting me can engage in a discussion with me and explain to me how I‚Äôm wrong. 
But you won‚Äôt you‚Äôre cowards, you‚Äôre part of the problem.
Well, I was born in Montreal but spent most of my time living in Vancouver, Edmonton and southwestern Ontario and returned for university and will be moving soon.
With that been said, the city has undoubtedly changed and also the people living here I found it quite hard to meet new people and form friendships as I have noticed many people have already begun their lifelong friendships and were quite judgemental of people they deemed different or did not fit their preconceived "mould" if that makes sense.
While in Edmonton, I found it relatively easy to meet new people, form friendships, and people were more open in that sense.
I also found the city to be quite divided in terms of enclaves, if that makes sense depending on the community. So forth you belong to, it seemed as if many people stuck within that group and did not know have much cultural knowledge except for the international food tasting, which was great, but it just seemed very surface level.
It was interesting to navigate anyhow as I was raised quite cultured, so I found it interesting how many just seemed not to have much cultural exchange even though we are very much a diverse city.
Furthermore, as someone mentioned in this thread, the outright racist behaviour I have noticed over the past five years left me shocked at times, and it continues as I did witness another incident a week ago at the grocery store among the many I have noticed and have personally encountered. 
Anyhow, Montreal is a great tourist city, but it truly depends on the individual and what you desire in your life and if you can achieve that desire while living here.
But I no longer romanticize my time here as Im older now and have lived in other cities, so every single city has its pros and cons.
[deleted]
I go back and forth. I‚Äôm not a native Montr√©aler but moved here a number of years ago. Some days, I feel like this is the best place I‚Äôve lived. The culture, the food, the canal, the summer weather, the people are all amazing. But there are days where I become disillusioned with it, especially when you consider the taxes, the garbage that accumulates, the never ending road and highway construction, and the winters. This is a great place to be but it‚Äôs not all roses.
Born and raised in Montreal, spent a year in New York as a kid, studied in Vancouver, then moved to Toronto, met a Dutch girl and now I live in the Netherlands. 
I miss most of the cities I‚Äôve lived in but Montreal is the one that gives me the strongest flashbacks. The neighborhoods, people, festivals and beers with friends, feelings so strong I can smell them, taste them.
I read somebody say ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok but it‚Äôs not paradise‚Äù,  for me it‚Äôs more that I am emotionally invested in the city.
PS: A lot of Dutch people like and travel to Canada but mostly English Canada. I‚Äôm also doing what I can here as an ‚Äúambassador‚Äù to encourage more interest.
As a vermonter I'm wistfully gazing across the border missing exploring the metropolis just a short drive north. QC seems super cool in general and I can't wait to explore more of the area once travel is safer & borders open.
It's super cool your not wrong. Having spent a decent amount of time in NYC I'd rather explore a new city (MTL) than drive 4x the distance south.
Agreed. I was born here and I will die here
I‚Äôll stick to the Bambi principle today.
I love Montreal, before the pandemic when we used to do some roadtrip outside Montreal, once we come back I always told my husband that We are finally home and it feels so good. Guess it‚Äôs true, home is where the heart is.
As someone who just moved here from the states, I think one of the reasons it‚Äôs so fun to talk about Montreal is that despite being awesome, it‚Äôs not totally over represented in the media. I moved here from NYC which is, IMO, an equally amazing city, but it‚Äôs kind of meh to talk about because everyone already knows exactly what it‚Äôs all about. In contrast, one of my good friends was born and raised in Brooklyn and yet didn‚Äôt even know Montreal existed until last year.
Nope. Montr√©al is plagued with problems with racism, poverty, infrastructure problems and corruption. You must be in a dreamland if you cannot see these issues
Y‚Äôall need to chill or some kind of hobby :) you also need to look at your last income tax statement
Same, born and raised in this fine city. It ain‚Äôt perfect, but the combination of French, English and many many other cultures makes this city so unique. I do see myself living in Rome, and Brooklyn for a while, but will indefinitely call Montreal my home, and will definitely come back.
Ok so i was born in Saguenay (ben oui, un bleuet!) and i got to the south shore when i was 6. I find myself in the middle: i love the atmosphere during festival season and most of the summer, while i also like the calm and quiet of my hometown and the wilderness. Do i like Montr√©al as a city to explore? Hell yeah. Would i live here all my life? I dont think so...
P.S: Tourti√®re du Saguenay > tourti√®re de MTL :P
Obsessed is exactly the word I would use for my feelings towards Montreal. I do not think it is a perfect city, but it is the perfect city for me!
Honestly im the opposite im constantly bashing mtl but really i should be more grateful. We have great skiing all winter, beautiful warm summers and lachine canal sunsets and music festivals and the best restaurants.... im sorry for being mean to u montreal i love u ü•≤
Haha, don't worry I feel this aswell, I think it's just a desire for some recognition. We're actually one of the great cities of North America (one of the first ever founded) and we've got strong roots, but it's because of our predominant French ancestry that we're hardly ever mentioned unlike New York and Boston and other major English cities, I think as more English-speakers move here, the more significant we'll be (like Toronto) over time.
Glad to meet a fellow Montrealer though.
Um it's definitely the best city in North America.
I moved here from the states late last year and I‚Äôve been spending most of my time here alone trying to entertain myself with video games and house plants.
Everyone tells me the city is great, but the pandemic has made it almost impossible to meet people and enjoy what the city has to offer.
For me, the greatest point about Montr√©al is the unbelievable amount of art and events happening for such a small city. Shame public transport is not as good once the metro coverage ends and if you want to get further than that you need a car for everything and be stuck on it for hours and hours at a time..
I came to Toronto from Europe in 2016 and lived there until now. I have visited Montreal at the end of 2017 for the first time, and fell in love with it immediately. I have visited twice more since, once before and once after covid, and I have to say the pandemic has really sapped its energy. But I can say the same for any city I have visited since this shit started, including Toronto.
I'll be completing my move to Montreal end of this month.
I am. I‚Äôm from the States and have visited your incredible city 7 or 8 times. To me there‚Äôs no place like it and no place as comprehensively awesome. I can‚Äôt wait until your borders open (even though I know y‚Äôall ‚Äúhate‚Äù Americans, even moreso now :( ). Edit: I don‚Äôt actually believe that as a generalization. I‚Äôve found y‚Äôall to be the most welcoming and even-keeled people I‚Äôve ever met
I talk about it to everyone I care about. I‚Äôve taken a half dozen different friends with me there by now. I consider it a home away from home.
I miss it. A lot :(.
When I decided to immigrate to North America years ago, I looked into all the major cities and picked Montreal because of its unique blend of European charm and North-American metropolis vibe, it's great cultural diversity and bilingualism, its open-mindedness, Canada and Quebec's great social system (compared to the US). Over a decade later, I still love Montreal and would not move anywhere else on this continent. I've been all over Canada and the US and I haven't found any other city that has everything Montreal has to offer.
Fuck que oui. 514 till I die yo
I lived nearby all my life and I have no idea what is interesting to do here.
What would be your recommendations of places/activities ?
I completely understand what you're talking about and it seems to be common among Montrealers - and obviously for good reason.
I'm originally from Montreal and have been away for far too many years - but I'm moving back in the next few months and I can't stop talking about it - I am SO excited! Everyone I tell always says how lucky I am to be moving back and that they wish they could move there, too. My wife has visited twice over the years and she's extremely excited to move there as well. :D
So ya... it's definitely a thing for sure that Montrealers love to talk about it. Even with the city's problems, we're proud of it, the culture and the joie de vivre and that makes the people and the city unique and special.
Montreal is great, and I feel lucky to live in this city when so much is happening again first time since the 70s, like the REM and all new rue Ste. Catherine and other small neighborhood projects.
Just, I wish, that Montreal had...
1. An indoor water park, like in Berlin, as MTLers hate winter. Biod√¥me could have been converted into this
2. An ice skateway, preferably on the Lachine canal, even in the limited sections
3. A ski hill on Mont-Royal
4. A real floating bath house, like in Copenhagen
MTL is blessed with the nature but it's terrible at integrating them except for the Parc du Mont Royal.

Development has skyrocketed along the canal. Great pic.
Camera apps should come with AI aids that help people get the horizon the right way. And they use vertical things, like buildings and trees, because if you're on an incline, the horizon shouldn't be flat.
Such a great walk, all down the canal. Post-industrial beauty.

I would like to come live in Montreal for the fall but I don‚Äôt speak French (from Vancouver)
Wow, such a soothing picture!
Tr√®s belle photo
euh... plus genre fin des ann√©es 60
Nikon N2020 + 50mm F1.4 , la pellicule √©tait expir√©e de 20 ans donc c'√©tait pas terrible, la plus part de mes photos √©taient completement sous expos√©es donc le scanneur √† eu beaucoup de difficult√© sur ce rouleau.
C'est difficile de faire de la photo argentique le soir. Suffit que ta vitesse soit basse (pas le choix pour laisser plus de lumi√®re d'imprimer sur ta pellicule) et que tu bouges un peu (genre tu respires en appuyant sur l'obturateur) et ta photo va √™tre floue.
Lol je viens de voir sur ton profil que tu fais de la photo, je te parlais de photo argentique comme √† un enfant hahaha
Ou scann√© une photo 4x6.
Montreal is extremely bilingual, you can easily get by even if you only speak english :) You will have a blast here !
I have a friend who did that 20 years ago or so, he owns a resto here and speaks French perfectly decently, married a local, very happy. Make a plan to learn some French and you'll get even more or of the city / province but your can definitely survive a good little while here in English...
I did the same move about 7 years ago. It's not as hard as you would think, you just need a reason to make the jump. Feel free to message me if you ever need advice on how to do it :)
Ok, merci pour les pr√©cisions! Je suis toujours curieux de voir ‚Äúwhat went wrong‚Äù
en effet, j'ai utilis√© un tripod mais je n'avais pas de "trigger release" donc c'est sur que l'appareil a boug√© lorsque j'ai pes√© sur l'obturateur
Hahaha 
Oui √©videment mais c‚Äôest la m√™me chose avec la photo num√©rique!
Effectivement, c‚Äôest peut etre le scan qui est hors focus ou le dev, je ne suis pas un expert!
Thank you!!! I know some very basics and I‚Äôm also fluent in Spanish which helps a little. I think we might!
Already know some basics and I‚Äôm fluent in Spanish which helps! The goal is definitely to immerse myself so I can become fluent!
You are so kind thank you! I visited a couple it years back and fell in love. Now my work switched to 100% remote so I have the ability to go. We are strongly considering it, just need to find an apartment!

Very beautiful. But I have a question for you French speakers, is soir evening or night? I hear it often for night but I thought nuit was night. Still in the beginning phases of learning French. Thanks.
Really beautiful
End soon
Night is nuit, soir is evening.
However, in the context of "bonsoir" vs "bonne nuit", "bonsoir" is for saying hello in the evening, and "bonne nuit" is for saying good night at bedtime, like "sleep well."
Soir is evening, while night is nuit!
That's actually a great question, I would say "soir" is anything after 5pm. If you want to meet somebody before dinner at 4pm it's more of "apr√®s-midi" but "soir" would be ok too, just very limit.
Soir refers to the evening - not sure when it would be used as ‚Äúnight‚Äù except maybe for ‚Äúhier soir‚Äù = last night (as in yesterday evening)
Bonne soir√©e is for saying goodbye in the evening.
In the summer time i'd say soir is a bit later than 5pm, around/after sunset in my book.
√áa pis les semi-remorques sur l'autoroute. C'est comme suivre un blizzard mobile.
Been saying it for years if cops actually cared about public safety on the road they‚Äôd setup check points before highway ramps and pull over every car that has snow on their roof and ticket them.
La r√©ponse commence par un ''P'', termine par un ''e'' et il y a ''aress'' entre les deux
Upvote for rolling igloos.  LOL
You mean some Montreal drivers are a-holes/selfish/self-absorbed ???
It's either ignorance or laziness. Penalties should be much higher for it. I'm an SUV driver and I always clean my roof and I'd prefer not to be associated with those assholes, thank you.
Also I will add on driver with no common sense for others :
Why not switching on the lights of your car during a storm/rain/snow/anything where visibility is low? 
I‚Äôm keeping my distance but it would be much more easier to do if I could see your actual position with your backlight.
Je me souviens üòÇ now I actually know why that's on the licence plates. I used to live in Quebec for a couple of years and yeah, rolling igloos/blizzards were all too common. I must admit that at times I was one of them, because I have t-rex arms and my trailblazer is rather tall. To my knowledge that only came around to bite me in the area, because once when breaking the ice slid off and got my windshield and bent my wiper. That was as bad as it got. I wish someone would have taught me better how to do things the Quebec way and survive winter so I wouldn t have to learn the hard way for a lot of things. I hope I can come back soon. I miss speaking French, I miss the warm people, and I most definitely miss the snow. Winter is my favourite season.
Also why is it that when someone fails to signal, they're always driving an SUV?
People are lazy af. Its hazardous as all hell when we deal with giant snowfalls like the last big saturday storm, it warms up then freezes over the next day crrating sheets of projectile ice. I already got a bit of my bumper broke  last year from a dickhead not cleaning his roof and a chunk of that ice hit it dead on on the 40. Lucky it wasnt the windshield, but my bumper looks like someone grabbed a giant holepuncher. üòÇ
At least last week I saw some of the cops off island in Vaudreuil *stopping* people who were too lazy to shovel of the foot of snow off their roofs and ticketing them. Like ffs just go grab your shovel and shove it off the car roof.
Because their are stupid and careless.
If you think about it, a lot of people don't want to wear a mask, there is probably a Venn diagram for both things and the overlap must be huge.
My mom literally "didn't know you had to". Most people just don't think about it until one day you drive behind a snowy suv.
Le pire c‚Äôest les conducteurs de SUV qui prennent pas la peine de d√©neiger leur fen√™tre de coffre. La majorit√© du temps en plus ils ont juste a activer leur essuie glace...
same reason as car drivers, some ppl are lazy fucks.
I think those are the drivers that give 0 crap about other drivers on the road. They simply don‚Äôt have the mindset of ‚Äúsharing the road‚Äù or being courteous
Pis pourquoi vous n'utilisez pas vos flashers?
I‚Äôm out here playing dodgeball on the 15 when I‚Äôm behind an 18 wheeler
i have seen them pulled over before. rare, but it happens.
we call them wedding cake cars, but i like your rolling igloo term better.
I saw a guy on my street literally drive his car back and fourth 10 times until the snow fell of the room instead of just using his brush. People are just fucking lazy.
y'a rien de nouveau... et c'est comme √ßa partout... pas juste √† Montr√©al.
Les policiers devraient donner plus de tickets √† ce sujet...
Esti de gang de paraisseux.
I think it's because they too short to reach the roof/top of it
I used my horn around 5 times in as many years driving in London, UK.
I don't drive much here, but I use my horn that many times a month. Great city, great province. Worst drivers.
Nous somme trop petits ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Pour vrai, j'ai pas de char pis le chialage a propos de la neige l'hiver me faire toujours rire.
"Suffer from t-rex arms" hahaha funny, upvoted
If you want an honest answer, I think it‚Äôs definitely half laziness but also because people with larger vehicles don‚Äôt invest in one of those extending snow cleaner brushes so they just kind of give up if they can‚Äôt really reach it lol. Assholes all round.
5foot2 :(
Ah, I know the answer to this.
They're inconsiderate assholes who can't be bothered to reach the roof of their car, and give zero fucks about snow and ice flying off and coming crashing down on other motorists.
La reponse facile est la simple paresse (pcq mes voisins sont assez grands pour atteindre le toit)
Yeah, idiots. It's not hard to find brushes that extend for tall vans and SUVs. If you can afford a big vehicle, you can afford the extra $5-10 for the longer brush.
[deleted]
Oh, they realize. They just don't care. You nailed it with "selfish".
A few years ago I highbeamed and horned a Dodge Caravan who was pelting me with chunks of snow and ice on Aut-15. He decided to roadrage on me.
Van?? I saw one on a Hyundai Accent... 
I wonder if these people flush after they are done at this point
So happy the cops finally started handing out tickets for this! :) now if we can just fix the cigarette tossers!
Passe le monde est cave, √©go√Øste et paresseux.
BTW There are more and more lazy people that don‚Äôt even remove snow before getting onto their car!  Forget about SUVs these are just people who just think about themselves, unfortunate sign of the times!
First day in Canada?
Because I'm lazy and I enjoy watching the snow peel off my car.  But you should probably change lanes.
Its qubac enough said
Ain't nobody got time for that, as soon I take the highway ramp it all flies off anyways. I'm aware that its a lazy fuck behavior, I will try to be better.
Chaque fois que j'en suis un, je prends sa plaque en note, comme pr√©caution. Je les d√©nonce pas, mais c'est pas vrai que je paye pour leur paresse.
I would imagine it's really hard to get the snow off the top of some of these trucks
C'est dur √† nettoyer le toit d'un SUV quand tu es petit surtout si tu n‚Äôas pas des barres marche-pied sur les c√¥t√©s. Ils devraient rendre √ßa obligatoire.

Pour avoir √©t√© camionneur, les remorques sont un vrai d√©fi logistique √† nettoyer : la grande majorit√© des grands terminaux ont des installations pour le d√©neigement, mais ils ne font venir les employ√©s qu'apr√®s des temp√™tes records, et toutes les petites cours de remorque ne sont pas √©quip√©es pour √ßa.
√Ä chaque fois que tu en parles √† ton r√©partiteur, il te r√©pond de t'organiser, ou bien qu'il va passer quelqu'un d'ici 1h...
Le quelqu'un en question passe habituellement 4-5h plus tard, et tu as perdu 1/2 journ√©e √† l'attendre sans paie.
√áa donne le r√©sultat qu'on connait : on embarque sur l'autoroute et il y a des nuages de flocons qui nous suivent pendant 30 minutes.
√áa m'a te dire c'est parce qu ou on pogn√© le trailer y ont pas d installation pour qu on l enl√®ve ou sinon il l ont mais vepas qu on s'en servent parce qu on est pas de la compagnie
Les semi-remorques, c'est dangereux mais c'est aussi compliqu√© l√©galement en termes de responsabilit√©. Dans beacoup de juridictions, les chauffeurs n'ont pas le droit de grimper pour d√©neiger eux-m√™me pour des raisons de sant√© s√©curit√© au travail.
An educational campaign might be effective also and inform the public of the fines and repercussions. Hell, even if there were no fines and these morons were just made to do it on the side of the highway in the cold, I'd be happy.

I would think the latter. Because I'm guessing the top number is an amount of steps...
But which direction to go?
Maybe the sun and strong shadows can guide you in the right directions. Go towards the light and find divinity?
Maybe the girl come from a nearby school? At the determined time (10:05 am/pm), trace back her steps and count 1150 steps.
Be careful and report back!

They will figure it out growing up that people are snitches, governement police doctors vets, cant be trusted and will turn on you the second they have something, the stock market is not free at all. The governements takes a 1/5 of what you make yearly and use it to buy lube : sure as hell are not using it to better society fix the roads (qc) and the healthcare system. Worst of all the people around you are all ME ME ME assholes and complain about the governement but then will be the first ones to pick up the phone and call the police when your fucking hedges are too high. Why dont we change this ? Why dont we stop pulling people down to better our situation? Why dont we start calling the police when it is REALLY necessary and not for minor inconveniances ? Why dont we change the taxation rates to be fair for everyone ? Why dont we change the justice system which was built to protect OLD WHITE PEOPLE that own the most money but are also the weakest and the most hypocritical slimey human beings? Why cant we look past LANGUAGE (HELLO QUEBEC) and race and religious beliefs ? Why cant we stand up (since apparently democracy= power to the people and stop the daily THIEVERY? Why are we scared and weak and no balls ? Why cant we be uncomfortable anymore? Words hurt ? Tell that to people who have been tortured or raped. They will laugh at the "words hurt". Do we have to be "the bullied" or the "bullies"? We cant be somewhere in between ?

Enjoy the easy karma i had to get that off my chest driving me crazy
Who the fuck goes on reddit AND type a major rant while zoned out on Ket?! He's probably a /r/stims user
I love coke i do it ~ once a week. Ket havent done in years. This post was done completely sober. But i get where ur getting at
Can you handle the truth ?
Really curious which parts of his comment was xenophobic, biggot and "ageist" ?
Can you single out sentences because I fail to see what you interpreted.
Only problem I see with this comment is that it‚Äôs so weird and out of place.
Ben, qui sait?
Regardes "Exit through the gift shop"
Certainement.
Thats why you go here: r/offmychest
I sure can, but i think we have different life priorities.  I've also never heard of anyone not trusting their vet.  That's odd.
The line about old white people being a problem and then the next line where they said we have to look beyond race?  It was quote the trip reading that.
Implying that Quebecers are "part of the problem" because they want to speak their own language. 
A typical anti-French sentiment which is still prevalent amongst Canadians. They used to say "speak white" but now they flipped it around and imply speaking French is racist. New font, same message.
The OLD WHITE People line is also quite problematic. For pretty obvious reasons.
Fuck Shiller Lavy.
Ah Shiller Lavy. The plague that destroyed the Mile End and is now slowly spreading into St-Henri.
Almost to wonder if the city gets a cut for letting them kill small businesses in favor of Lululemon, Tim Horton's and McDonald's. Not to mention 150% rent increases on residential.
Jte dis qu‚Äôon va en voir des pancartes Shiller Lavy dans les mois/ann√©es √† venir!
le cagibi still exists - it moved to little italy
Fuck Shiller Lavy, anybody been to the new Cagibi in little Italy?
<3
aah i went to le cagibi from when i was started walking until my very early cegep years. i was devastated when i learnt shiller lavy took it over. i miss this place so much.
Damn, j'ai h√¢te de retourner au D√©panneur, prendre un caf√© en √©coutant de la bonne musique... √ßa me manque!
You're on fire
Fuck Shiller Lavy, may they both suffer long and die of colorectal cancer.
Because this seems to be a rant about how indy shops get replaced with corporate boxes. That strip of st viateur is zoned artisanal and so until the borough rezones or provides an easement the area will be stuck renting it to boutiques.
Also, no one travels to go visit a tim hortons or lulu lemon. Franchising that street would be a death sentence.
Ah man I was just talking about the Cagibi the other day! RIP ;(
RIP Le Cagibi. <3
Le Cagibi - one of many Shiller Lavy real estate acquisitions victim.  It was a live music venue, a community centre, a vegetarian caf√©, a neighbourhood hang out space for 10 years. It really sucks when Shiller Lavy buys another building in the Mile End, you know it means the neighbourhood will lose one more long time institution, and the space will sit empty until they find a Lululemon or a David's Tea type tenant.  Cagibi space sat vacant for 2 years.
I guess with Quebec residential rent control, the change will be less immediate on residential rent increases. With commercial, they can double rent of an existing tenant (which they did with Le Cagibi).
Shiller Lavy sont actifs partout en ville, ils ont des tonnes de locaux sur Mont-Royal ou dans le Vieux, par exemple. 
Mais c'est pas juste eux non plus le probl√®me. Les autres proprios finissent par faire la m√™me chose. C'est un petit proprio qui poss√®de l'√©difice o√π il y avait Comptoir 21 et Pizza Saint-Viateur, sur Saint-Viateur, il a quand m√™me d√©cid√© de sacrer dehors ses deux locataires √©tablis pour des hausses de loyer draconienne. Comme Shiller-Lavy ferait. 
Pis le pire, est-ce qu'il a tord de sa perspective? Les deux locaux n'ont plus de pancartes √† louer depuis quelques jours... 
Les prix baissent seulement quand un endroit voit une GROSSE vacance. √áa ne changera pas sans r√®glementation et un bras de fer avec les proprios pour l√©gif√©rer...
surement √† l'infinit√©... ou jusqu'√† ce que le quartier entier soit transform√© en Lululemon/David's Tea.
That's actually really good to know; i'm glad it's still alive in some form. Still a sin that it's been lost to the Mile End community, though.
Yeah it‚Äôs different but they still have the fogged-over windows in the winter :)
Le Cagibi existe toujours! St-Laurent, entre Beaubien et St-Zotique. Ils vendent m√™me de l'art maintenant. Keep supporting them!
(yes I am copy pasting this comment everywhere)
:)
there is a lululemon on that street now
Still exists, they moved to little Italy! I miss the old space a lot but the cozy vibes are still there in the new place.
Le Cagibi existe toujours! St-Laurent, entre Beaubien et St-Zotique. Ils vendent m√™me de l'art maintenant. Keep supporting them!
Je me d√©pla√ßait de Villeray pour allez au Cagibi pour le vibe positif et tellement old school Montr√©al. C'est des d√©cisions comme √ßa qui tue le sense d'appartenance √† un cartier et m√™me une ville. Nos parents l'ont pas eu facile, mais au moins dans ce temps la il y avait une certaine fiert√© de ou tu √©tais. 
√Ä part le West Island mais bon. üòÇ
J'aimais bien le pleurnichage de Shiller Lavy dans les journaux:  "on aime St-Viateur! On veut un locataire!". Ben criss, t'en as sacr√© un dehors qui t'as offert 50% d'augmentation! 
J'ai rien contre le nouvel occupant du local, au moins c'est pas une grosse cha√Æne nationale ou am√©ricaine, mais le Cagibi √©tait sp√©cial c'est certain. Pis son nouvel emplacement, c'est juste pas la m√™me chose.
Oui, je connais Le Cagibi bien, et Pharmacie Esperanza avant √ßa... I also understand that gentrification is inevitable and part of the life cycles of cities, unless the city steps in and does something about it. :/
Le Cagibi was those things and still is (well except for live music). It continues to exist on St-Laurent, in Little Italy, and they are open during the pandemic. Keep supporting them!!!
That's disgusting. :-( Why would a city allow developers to choke the life out of local cultural institutions like that? Do they want every neighbourhood in Montreal to look exactly the same?
...I know, the answer is money. It's always money. But there are other kinds of value in the world.
oui 100% d'accord. c'est in√©vitable sans r√®glementation.
[I wouldn't be especially concerned about David's Tea moving in anytime soon.](https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/davidstea-only-reopening-18-stores-as-it-shuts-down-166-canadian-locations-1.5046491)
It was heartbreaking walking by the corner for an entire 2 years with the √Ä Louer sign in the window knowing Le Cagibi had been thriving there and its being there contributed to the thriving neighbourbood vibe.
lost the music venue
Wow. Times have changed. 
Might be a good time to write to Richard Ryan and Marie Plourd about what that means to you in the neighborhood.
On a unrelated note  Anyone want to split on a tim$ franchise?
Ah right...I guess to me as a musician the old Cagibi died on St Laurent :( always forget about the new location bc it was about the shows for me!
Oui t‚Äôas raison - mais pour moi comme musicienne c‚Äô√©tait les spectacles qui me manque. :( C‚Äôest dommage que ce ne soit pas possible au nouvel emplacement.
Le Cagibi existe toujours! St-Laurent, entre Beaubien et St-Zotique. Ils vendent m√™me de l'art maintenant. Keep supporting them!
effectivement :/
Which in their current form, they never will because they rely on constantly increasing property value because that's their main way of increasing their tax revenue
It's a shame they get choked out. These places move on to another neighbourhood like La Petite Patrie, Petite Italy, or recently, for Chez de Gaulle croissant/bakery, all the way to Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu(!) after its rent was hiked up from $1950 to $6500 (also after a Shiller Lavy acquisition...).  Mile End is loses little by little what makes it so special one Shiller Lavy acquisition at a time.  I suppose the shift will revitalize other neighbourhoods (for good or for bad depending on a person's perspective) until the exact same shift happens there.
I feel the same way. When I first moved to montreal I was just a couple blocks from le Cagibi and it always symbolized so much of what I loved and valued about that neighbourhood.
that was bound to happen, dont know if that part of St Laurent would want a music venue ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Yeah :( They do host musical performances from time to time still, but without a stage it can‚Äôt really be a venue or hold shows the way they used to.
Yah that back room was magical! Some good times there
good stuff, im ordering au coq instead of st-hubert now
Heartwarming! Thank you for sharing the good news
How generous of this restaurateur on a full swing sunday morning üòÇü§£ I like to see kind people do kind stuff like that!
Bravo
I wish there could be some food trucks to bring meals like this to the homeless. I assume many MTL restaurants would be willing to donate meals to an organization like this.
Please help sign this petition to give hero pay to grocery employees under the Loblaws umbrella (No Frills, Loblaws, Superstore).
https://you.leadnow.ca/petitions/tell-loblaws-reinstate-hero-pay-for-frontline-workers?bucket&source=facebook-share-button&time=1606863966&utm_campaign=blast2020-12-01&utm_source=facebook&share=8e1bb24c-5cf6-42fa-a44e-4a9047d2b13f&fbclid=IwAR2EfsGeAfJ1N0CGvuuMVV4mwLGDWNdJ0hJLCdS7BSRVzWuEpsoEp1nxbC8
The living wage for Toronto as of 2019 is 20.08$/hr working full time. Despite this, most clerks at grocery stores make 14$/hr.
A lot of them per my friends/family who work in Loblaws have their part timer hours either below 10hrs/week or deliberately kept just under 40hrs/week as for the company not to have to give them benefits.
They have no stability in their hours. Schedules are often changed last minute in the same week despite union contract stating they have to post schedules 2 weeks in advance.
These clerks are literally risking their lives everyday to bring food on our tables. I work in healthcare and think it's abysmal. Just because they don't have quote 'professional' jobs it doesn't mean we don't need to treat them with respect. I actually feel more scared for workers working at grocery stores ATM than myself. I bet most can barely afford to put food on their own tables.
They are scared of speaking up or calling in sick as their income is so low or they are afraid of getting fired.  So more Covid.
One friend also working for Loblaws  told me they were going to get interviewed by 2 newspapers but the newspapers were ultimately denied permission to talk to them by Loblaws a few months back when the journalists asked for formal permission - keep in  most workers interviewed for articles is are actual union stewards as well and my friend isn't. They think it's because they are afraid of more whistle blowers and want to control their PR. Sounds like musling to me. Very 1984.

I thought restos were struggling?
Au Coq tastes way better in my opinion.  But you know, St-Hubert also gives meals for Xmas (a tradition since at least 15 years), I worked for them for about 10 years and one time I participated to the Xmas meal at the Accueil Bonneau.  We distributed something like 800-900 meals also, directly at the table to the homeless people.  They were happy and I'm glad I was part of it, I also had the time to share a few words with some of them and I felt the gratitude.  Some of them don't talk to a lot of people usually and they're used to get weird looks on the street but I spoke to them like they were friends, family, with a lot of respect and empathy.  It's a heartwarming thing that everyone should do in their lives, go feed the homeless people, participate in an activity like this.  Congrats and thanks to Au Coq for such a nice initiative.

Note this is one franchisee. Other locations are doing things like being hard-ass landlords to the business that's been upstairs for 20 years but can't operate during a pandemic.
Seriously a great value for the price. One of the best poutine also. The cheese comes separate and therefore does not melt when delivered to you.

People have big hearts, regardless of their momentary financial position.
Les restos de livraison font de meilleures affaires qu'avant. Poulet, pizza, sushi, etc. Bonnes affaires ou pas, c'est tr√®s g√©n√©reux de sa part.
What a bad take to make
larger restaurants that specialize in chicken or steak (for example) usually have standing orders with suppliers. It is possible it made more sense to cook and donate some chickens and grab the publicity. Moishes did a similar burger give away before they closed.
Je ne suis pas trop au courant pour cette succursale l√† mais au coq fait son chiffre d'affaires en pour emporter et livraison en g√©n√©ral. 
Celui l√† est au march√© central donc il perd une client√®le de travailleurs sur l'heure du midi mais ils doivent compenser avec les livraisons chez les gens qui sortent tr√®s peu.
That's like saying Walmart isn't struggling so local stores must not be struggling.
Au Coq is a chain that always did well thanks to many locations and delivery just like St-Hubert. That's not the case for the majority of restaurants which are just single locations.

i thought it was funny. People way too serious on here
Pourquoi tant de downvotes?
oh man, how am I supposed to pick where to order my chicken now? lol
Au Coq's chicken taste better and also bigger.
At St-Hubert it's the sauce that is better.
Yeah, it should just come down to what food you like more because st hubert donates and sponsors plenty.  Personally, I just about hate everything on st huberts menu though. I'm partial to cote st luc bbq.
Parce qu‚Äôil √©crit un commentaire ingrat qui implique que puisque Au Coq va bien, le reste des restaurants doivent bien aller aussi. Peut-√™tre ce n‚Äô√©tait pas ce qui √©tait impliqu√© mais √ßa sonne comme √ßa.
Parce qu'en quoi le fait que les restos sont en difficult√© est pertinent lorsqu'il est question de saluer une belle action de la part de l'un d'entre eux?
mod is always a target.
For real, Au Coq tastes way better and the fries are fucking good, coleslaw too.  Their chicken is always good and they also have nice desserts on the menu.  I'm a bit pissed off about St-Hubert because of certain things and I realized that their food is too salty, every time I eat some St-Hubert, I drink like 1 litre of water with my meal because of this.
Poulet bronze
au coq is way cheaper. isnt it like 7$ for a chef's choice meal ?
Parce que c'est probablement un individu bien malheureux qui est jaloux car il ne fait pas de bonnes actions et pas une crisse de cenne pour se payer du poulet.  C'est tjrs plus facile de chier sur les autres que de saluer les bonnes choses.
Have you ever tried their roasted chicken? I've only ever had their fried chicken which I was pretty satisfied with.
YOOOOO I just tried their shrimp sandwich and yo..... AMAZING
Only fried. The place looks sketchy enough as it is and I dont want to risk it with something that might not be very fresh. The chicken poutine is good too.
Mon Ami is also pretty good...but poulet bronze is really good for traditional fried chicken.
lol now ill have to try it

No matter which way you look at it...
"Protesters were right, vaccines fuck the world" - what did spreading the virus accomplish
"Protesters were wrong" - well, good luck with your protests, not really, fuck you
That's a lot of stupid people...
I dont understand the anti-mask people *specifically*. Its well past time the government moved towards thinking in *mode solution* and started figuring out risk-mitigation strategies to re-open the economy, schools, small businesses etc; wearing masks (properly) seems like an effective, low cost first step. If your opposed to the immanent lockdown, you should be in favor of masks... So what is these people's problem? Why arent they saying "We dont ban driving, we wear seatbelts; dont ban the library, wear a mask"...
$1546 sont pas sufficent pour le couts du l'hopital si touts c'est covidiots tomb malade
i walked by a similar protest the other week. saw some thin blue line flags, Q posters, etc. as i was walking by, this one dude kept filming me and zooming into my face for some reason. the people there looked so cracked out. 
the people that partake in fringe politics are never well adjusted.
Hey, Minist√®re De L'√âducation, you have some work to do.

Si seulement le SPVM avait eu la m√™me pr√©sence lors des manifestations de cet √©t√©.
On pourrait financer le PCU en donnant des contraventions au gens qui manifeste.
Il devrait y avoir une note au dossier m√©dicale √† quiconque re√ßoit une contrevention comme √ßa qu'ils ont volontairement d√©cid√© de s'exposer au covid et qu'ils sont donc pas admissibles a utiliser l'assurance m√©dicale pour le traitement de la maladie ou de quelconque complications d√ªt au covid. Je veux pas payer pour le r√©tablissement de ces asti de colons l√†.
This is why we are on full lockdown again.... not because I went to have dinner with my mom

That's a lot of stupid people who got caught.
It is just the tip of the iceberg. There are a LOT more.
What's worse is if 90% of people wore the damned masks, we wouldn't even need to lockdown and could live somewhat more normally. 
Fucking entitled assholes.
going through this with my roommates. presumably if you want to have lots of people over you'll make sure they wear masks so i have less of a case against that? but no
Sans compter que les coco vides vont aussi en rendre plein d'autres malades

√áa prends en 7 sinon c'est illisible /s
Il y avait plein de policiers durant l'√©t√© mais les participants du manif √©taient presque tous masqu√©s. Je vois pas de probl√®mes.
On portait des masques cet √©t√© et des tonnes de gens distribuaient du Purell. Des pommes et des oranges.
Moins de 100 cas par jour vs les 2000+ qu‚Äôon a ces temps-ci... la situation est totalement diff√©rente.
J'ai une theorie que c'est fait par expres pour reduire la vitesse des voitures. 
J'avais habit√© dans le meme coin et ca fait 5-6 and ils ont chang√© le timing des rues paralleles a 30-40km/h quand la limite est souvent de 50.
Sans parler des feux qui durent 5 min contr√¥ler parle les policiers pour √©viter le trafic mais en fait ca fais juste causer plus de trafic
ce qui me f√¢che c'est quand je suis un pi√©ton qui veut traverser tout droit, et √† ma gauche il y a une voiture qui veut tourner √† droite. nos deux lumi√®re sont rouges, puis, nos deux lumi√®res deviennent vertes en m√™me temps.
Still better than Sherbrooke. Whenever a pedestrian presses a crossing button, all 4 directions would go red, so he can cross diagonally.
Montr√©al, en particulier le coeur de l'√Æle √† une forte densit√© de circulation dans toute les direction en m√™me temps. Si tu syncronise un c√¥t√©, les autres c√¥t√©s sont compl√®tement d√©synchronis√©. Donc ils font des compromis assez d√©sagr√©able j'en conviens. √áa pourrais s√ªrement √™tre mieux mais ce ne sera jamais parfait.
Habituellement le monde qui dise √ßa savent pas que tu ne peux pas synchroniser les feux dans les 2 directions. Tu dois faire un choix de quelle direction tu veux aider, et l'autre va en souffrir. C'est normale.
Le probl√®me est beaucoup plus vaste que le simple timing des feux de circulations. Il y aura toujours des probl√®mes tant que les villes seront uniquement adapt√©s pour les automobilistes, comme c'est le cas en Am√©rique du Nord. 
Je vous encourage fortement √† √©couter les vid√©os de "Not just bikes" qui explique parfaitement pourquoi les villes nord am√©ricaines ont les pire design d'urbanisme au monde., et c'est surtout parce que on privil√©gie les voitures dans tous nos d√©placements. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bglWCuCMSWc
Visiblement tu n'as pas connu la p√©riode pr√©-synchronisation
Boulevard Ste-Foy √† Qu√©bec has entered the chat
Non, t‚Äôes pas le seul. 
Heureusement, les √©lections municipales vont mettre fin √† tout espoir de s‚Äôen sortir.
Sur RL O, entre Papineau et la place Desjardins, je pogne litt√©ralement toutes les lumi√®res, un fucking Samedi-dimanche matin (le moment que les lumi√®res synchronis√©es devraient marcher parfaitement √† 50 km/h). Pis c'est pas une histoire de ''y veulent me ralentir donc faudrait que je roule √† 40 pour √™tre synchro'', j'attends au moins 30 sec a chaque lumi√®re, faudrait que j'aille a 20 km/h je crois.
√Ä v√©lo sur St-Denis le matin de semaine, si tu ne veux pas avoir √† pogner toutes les lumi√®res rouges une √† une jusqu‚Äôau centre-ville, pas le choix d‚Äôen br√ªler une pour avoir une sentiment de ne pas √™tre arr√™ter √† chaque 2-3 coups de p√©dales. Les gens qui arr√™tent, se tannent apr√®s 3-4 lumi√®res puis br√ªlent une lumi√®re, pas certain que ce soit bien bien plus prudent de vouloir limiter la vitesse des gens jusqu‚Äô√† un certain point. √áa cr√©e un effet inverse.
Les ronds-points pourraient r√©soudre une partie des soucis causes par les feux de circulation (Pas d'arr√™t arbitraire du v√©hicule quand le trafic est faible notamment - probl√®me commun aux lumi√®res et aux arr√™ts)
Il y a probablement une raison qui explique leur absence: Peut-√™tre que la population serait d√©stabilis√©e de voir une nouvelle sorte d intersection, ou que c'est peu/difficilement praticable pour les gros/long v√©hicules?
Non. Ils sont synchroniser parfaitement, pour augmenter la congestion.
La synchronisation a √©t√© faite √† leurs installations, tous ax√© sur les Boulevard. Depuis il y a eu beaucoup de changements, dont des remplacement d'√©quipements, des mises √† jour partiel et des r√©ductions de limites pour ralentir le trafic.
√áa co√ªte cher en perte de taxes de production √† la ville et en √©missions de CO2 additionnels. Par contre ce ne sont pas des chiffres qui apparaissent dans les comptes de la ville, donc synchroniser le syst√®me est toujours calcul√© comme un co√ªt et non comme un investissement.
Puis √ßa avantage un peu les services d'urgence car si tu va autour de 1,5x la limite permise dans la majorit√© des boulevards, tu peux pogner quasiment toutes les vertes.
ce qui me rend la plus folle c'est qu'on paie des policiers √† contr√¥ler les lumi√®res dans les zones de construction. caliss, les autres villes ont tout simplement des cam√©ras et un centre o√π ils peuvent plus syst√©matiquement et logiquement le traffic partout avec surtout moins de monde. la police peuvent-ils pas aller faire leur travail? what the fuck??? ce sont les vrais probl√®mes de notre ville, pas la crisse de hauteur des √©difices
Imagine chauffer en ville
Yes, but...
Often lights programming isnt immediately obvious. Some streets, like sherbrooke, are synchronized for busses. Other lights are programmed to mitigate a dangers like traffic accidents or congestion in unwanted areas. 
Ultimately it's a balancing act. No system is going to be perfect for all the different types of traffic all the time so planners get blamed for an impossible situation.
Je suis √† Baie-Comeau , o√π il y a UN seul boulevard principal, et donc ce serait logique de synchroniser les lumi√®res pour avantager le boulevard le plus achaland√©.  Les lumi√®res ne sont PAS synchronis√©s et sont absolument √©terneles et restent vertes trop longtemps pour les rues moins passantes qui croisent, ce qui cause des longues files d‚Äôattentes sur le boulevard pendant que PERSONNE ne circule sur la rue adjacente.   Je n‚Äôavais jamais vu des lumi√®res aussi mal configur√©s et avec aucune synchronisation dans TOUTE la ville.  Au moins il y a pas trop de traffic‚Ä¶
J'pense que √ßa d√©pend √† quel point tu es press√©.
Ca d√©pend de la direction que tu prends.
Vous avez √©chapp√© ceci: "je"
They are modified by police for construction so often and never synched back to "normal" it's so infuriating!!
√áa va para√Ætre tr√®s contre-intuitif √† beaucoup de gens, mais je suis pas mal s√ªre que c'est fait expr√®s.
Beaucoup d'√©tudes ont d√©montr√© que si tu rends l'automobile plus agr√©able √† utiliser, les gens qui ont des autos vont juste les utiliser plus, m√™me si d'autres options de transport existent, et ce genre de mesures ont tendance √† augmenter l'utilisation du r√©seau routier, mais pas vraiment la fluidit√© du trafic ou les temps de transit (c'est les m√™mes √©tudes qui sont cit√©es pour argumenter contre le 3e lien √† Qu√©bec). Donc, a priori, le but avou√© de pas mal de planification urbaine ces temps-ci, c'est en partie de rendre le transport en automobile plus fastidieux -- ou, en tout cas, on fait juste vraiment aucun effort pour rendre la vie plus agr√©able aux automobilistes.
L'id√©e derri√®re, c'est que tu veux que les seules personnes qui roulent en voiture en ville soient les quelques personnes pour qui c'est vraiment, absolument la seule option envisageable. Les sens uniques partout, les restrictions sur le stationnement, tout est planifi√© pour d'une part dissuader les gens de l'ext√©rieur de venir √† Montr√©al en voiture, et d'autre part dissuader les Montr√©alais.e.s de s'acheter ou de poss√©der des voitures, parce que ce qui fait vraiment une grosse diff√©rence, bien plus que "le stop/start", c'est carr√©ment juste le nombre de v√©hicules sur la route.
Donc, en r√©sum√© : oui, √ßa se peut que la synchronisation des feux ne fasse pas toujours l'affaire des automobilistes -- √ßa se peut m√™me que ce soit fait enti√®rement expr√®s.
C'est pour ralentir les voitures.
Faut qu'on parle du nombre debile de stop aussi...
On pourrait facilement faire des feux de circulations qui changent automatiquement quand il n'y a plus personne pour prendre le feu vert. Quoi de plus frustrant que tout le monde qui attend pour rien.
https://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2021/09/25/feux-de-circulation-a-montreal-comment-assurer-une-synchronisation
Effectivement c‚Äôest de la merde la synchro des feux. 
La ville d√©pense √† toutes les ann√©es pour analyser la circulation‚Ä¶ entre autre avec l‚Äôapp MTL Trajet (https://montreal.ca/programmes/etude-mtl-trajet).
Je participe √† chaque fois‚Ä¶ et bien sinc√®rement je n‚Äôai vu aucune am√©lioration dans les derni√®res ann√©es.
Montreal's lights are mechanical, you can synchronize them, but it takes a blackout of the whole city to do it :)
For sure!
I‚Äôve noticed it has gotten worse over the last few years. 
I hate the go, stop, go, at every other street.
A very sneaky way of troubling car drivers and make people think twice about driving in the city.
C'est le temps de les rendre intelligents! Comme √† LA! Sur une √Æle comme Montr√©al, √ßa pourrait beaucoup aider..
Henri-Bourassa, de Langelier at ST-Laurent, en soiree, si t'en pogne 1 verte et tu roules a 50 km/h tu les pognes toutes vertes.
si tu pognes la premiere rouge, change de rue :P
Dans quelle ville ils sont bien synchro?
Je trouve amusant que la pluspart des commentaires suppose une forme ou une autre de planification des feux. Personnellement je pense que c'est un autres cas de l'incomp√©tence de la ville. Les feux ne sont pas √©quip√©s pour √™tre synchronis√©s, c'est tout. Ce serait trop cher et demanderait une planification des travaux qui √† l'√©vidence est au del√† des capacit√©s de la ville.
https://xkcd.com/277/
Il se prend pleins de d√©cisions √©pouvantables. Saint-Michel direction nord, coin Saint-Joseph. Avant il y avait trois voies pour tourner d‚Äôun c√¥t√© ou l‚Äôautre ou continuer. Un beau matin ils ont retranch√©s la voie du virage √† gauche avec une zone hachur√©e. √áa bouchonne tout les matins et on perds un temps fous. Les r√©sidents se font enquiquiner avec du bruit et des √©manations. AUCUNE raison de faire √ßa, pas pour les v√©los, ni les pi√©tons. Saint-Joseph qui change sans cesse entre 30 et 40 km/h. üòñ
Ca fait 30 ans que Je dis ca
Bah t'a qu'√† rouler plus lentement ou beaucoup plus vite..
mais oui c chiant le stop-go-stop-go pour rien et les limites √† 30-40 partout..
Horrible here. Everything in my area is either 1000 stop signs or poorly sync lights. One light goes green the one 300m away goes red just as you approach going 40kph. Then it's 8 stop signs in a row 50m apart.
Speak English Frenchy pants
Pleins de beaux vid√©os pour nous expliquer comment √ßa  marche : https://montreal.ca/articles/comprendre-les-feux-de-circulation-14736 . Mais il ne faut pas oublier que Montr√©al est la derni√®re ville en Am√©rique du Nord √† avoir des feux √† contr√¥le √©lectro-m√©canique. Aussi la seule ville avec New York √† interdire le virage √†  droite au feu rouge. Le probl√®me est que nos feux sont synchronis√©s en supposant que le virage √† droite est permis. Facile √† remarquer car si on pouvait tourner √† droite au feu rouge, on pourrait avoir la verte sur la rue o√π on s'engage. Enfin, le syst√®me a √©t√© compl√®tement corrompu par tous les changements apport√©s aux vitesses (30, 40, 50) entre autres. Aussi, pour ceux qui pensent que nos villes sont faites pour les voitures, vous vous trompez. Elles sont faites pour nous et nous avons des v√©hicules de mobilit√© personnel, quels qu'ils soient. Avoir une voiture permet d'avoir acc√®s √† un vaste √©ventail de services et d'accepter des emplois qui seraient autrement inaccessibles en plus de nous permettre de sortir de la ville dans la direction qui nous pla√Æt. La voiture est un instrument de progr√®s.
Pas une th√©orie, j'ai des amis ing√©nieurs en circulation qui ont travaill√© pour la Ville et la synchronisation (ou pas) fait partie de l'√©ventail d'outils permettant de contr√¥ler quels axes sont favoris√©s par les automobilistes. On pourrait vouloir les d√©courager d'utiliser un axe en s'assurant qu'une option parall√®le est mieux synchronis√©e par exemple.
Apr√®s, ya aussi de l'incomp√©tence au sein des gens charg√©s de ce travail lol.
Edit: je vous garantis que les plaintes faites au 311 sont entendus par le personnel de la Ville. Si votre rue est mal synchronis√©e, plaignez-vous. √áa peut marcher.
Nous pouvons synchroniser les feux pour laisser les voitures rouler √† 40km/h
Je pense la m√™me chose, it‚Äôs not a bug it‚Äôs a feature. J‚Äôai le malheur √† devoir conduire sur The Boulevard tous les matins‚Ä¶. C‚Äôest atroce et √ßa pourrait √™tre tellement mieux.
Apr√®s ca ils sont surpris que le monde roule a 60-65km/h pour rattraper les lumi√®res...
Peut-√™tre, mais si tu as des feux synchronis√©s √ßa peut encourager les autos √† rouler plus lentement. Si tu remarques que tu vas toujours avoir des rouges >40 km/h, (ou quoi que ce soit la limite), c'est probable que tu vas choisir de rouler √† cette vitesse. Quand tu as beaucoup de chance d'avoir le rouge, les gens essayent d'aller plus rapidement/acc√©l√©rer pour "attraper" le vert (moi je fais √ßa, c'est certain!). 
J'ai habit√© dans un endroit o√π c'√©tait le cas pour la rue centrale qui passait par le centre-ville. C'√©tait vraiment efficace - le timing √©tait si pr√©cis que tu pouvais rouler vers un rouge avec 100% confiance qu'il va tourner vers le vert au moment que tu y arrives si tu roulais √† la limite ou juste en dessous (alors pas n√©cessaire de freiner).
Most definitely yes. 
I think either current administration or the one before set it that way.
Les feux de circulation sont l√† pour faire ralentir les autos? Qui l'eut cru! Je pensais qu'ils √©taient l√† pour qu'elles aillent plus vite!  /s
C'est quoi le delire des policiers qui sont la toutes les 3 intersections ? Montreal est pas capable d'avoir des feux qui se regulent tout seul ?
Wait, we have a Leonard Cohen mural? First I‚Äôve heard of it.
Leonard Cohen is watching you masturbate
Did you intend to make it look like a giant Leonard Cohen in the sky
I definitely wouldn't have recognized Montreal without that mural of Leonard Cohen!
Yo dawg, I heard you like Leonard Cohen paintings so I put Leonard Cohen painting in my painting of a Leonard Cohen street scene.
nice painting! [But suddenly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OkpRK2_gVs)
Poster 9x la photo de Nico Rizzuto (https://images.app.goo.gl/KyXKryhQt1an8wcT6) sur Reddit c'est assez intense
Who?
You should hold it up next to the mural for a full Cohen effect.
Lol...he's peeking at us.

It's on Rue Crescent, lively place on weekends, at least during the before times.

No need for rude comments here...
No, this is on a building in Montreal on Crescent Street.
C'est une nouveaut√© Clairement ajout√©e la semaine pass√©e!
Every time I walk by it, my mind immediately thinks it is Anthony Bourdain, even though I know it is supposed to be Cohen ahaha!
The celebrity chef who sadly died three years ago, he liked Montreal quite a lot and went to Au Pied de Cochon. I think that's why he's on a mural now.
Nice
Yes, I currently sell prints, here is the order form with all of the info:

Thank you so very much!
grandpa, tell me of the before times!?
Where‚Äôs the other??
Yes. They're very much needed on this post.
Have you ever read Leonard Cohen?
Or do you just enjoy commodifying his image?
Because Cohen would have preferred the above comment to yours.
lol
Yes, I live near that one, but why is Leonard Cohen looking down on us from the heavens in your painting?
Impossible
tony bourdain
Thank you for this. /u/Omnicharge buys prints too.
Yes I have, and I met him twice. Very humble man.
Do not question the elevated one
Oh nice! Thanks for pinging me! I just bought 5 prints
I don't care what your ideologies are. If you're considering voting for Coderre, you'll contribute to giving the keys to city to promoters and developpers who have no interest in the greater good.   
And also, why aren't we talking about densification outside of downtown? That's where the real issue is in my opinion.
The idea that high rises is the answer to affordable housing is completely laughable. It's ridiculous she even had to make this pledge.
Is this actually a contentious policy?  Like is there polling showing that citizens actually want larger towers than are already here?
To be fair, newer constructions are absolut shite.
Le debat le plus stupide a Montr√©al, et ca en dit gros.
"a privatization of the views of the mountain"
Comme je l'ai mainte fois d√©montr√© sur ce sub, le r√©glement sur la hauteur ne change \*absolument\* rien quant a la vue de la montagne a partir de la ville. La hauteur actuellement permise cache le Mont-Royal m√™me de la rive-sud.
Je ne vois pas l'int√©r√™t de d√©velopper si haut quand il y a plein d'endroits autour du centre-ville o√π les b√¢timents ne d√©passent pas 2-3 √©tages. Il y a encore √©norm√©ment de places √† densifier avant d'√©riger un gros penis comme a dubai.
I contend that the only reason this is controversial is because the issue has been politicized. Otherwise, no one fucking cares.
I'm not sure how I feel about this. 
No one in New York city complains that you can't see the Hudson from Central Park. It's not like the park is ruined by being surrounded by skyscrapers. If there's new and interesting construction projects that go over the 232 meter range (which would increase the population density and perhaps encourage public transit at the expense of the banlieue) is it such a bad thing? 
I'm very pro Val√©rie Plante, i'm just not sure how I feel with regards to this very issue. Convince me otherwise.
Great, let's take down the cross on top of the mountain then. Until then any secularism initiative is plainly discriminatory against non-Christians.
Good.
I get it, and rationally support it, I also think really tall skyscrapers are cool if a little pointless these days. 
So yeah, head says this is good, heart says "me wanty big tower"
Mais c‚Äôest quoi la solution ? Quelqu‚Äôun peut m‚Äô√©clairer sur √ßa ?
New-York ont du construire en hauteur par manque d‚Äôespace, je pense que √ßa va nous arriver un jour dans le futur non ?
she's still around??
I know this idea silly but why not copy London (the real one in England) by only allowing such buildings if they don‚Äôt obscure the sacred cross, thus they have to get creative and give them funny shapes
Moi je trouve que le vrai probl√®me en se moment c'est qu'avec les limites actuelle, on est entrain de cr√©er un plateau a exactement 200m (a 190m+ il y en avait 5 en 2015, 6 en 2017 et il y en a 6 en construction en se moment)  
et ensuite, le plateau tombe a 160m exact, ensuite 120m exact, 80m et 60m.  
Au lieu d'avoir le visuel d'une montagne de gratte-ciel que la plus part des ville on, Montr√©al sera un escalier...  
Peut importe les limite de hauteur, se qui serait int√©ressant, c'est d'introduire une r√®gle d'angle de vue prot√©ger sur le mont royal.  
Un peut comme Londre a sur la St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, ce qui a forcer les promoteur a cr√©er des architecture unique, puisqu'il ne pouvait pas obstruer la vue sur la cath√©drale a partir de lieu pr√©cis.  
(Vue prot√©ger de Londre : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected\_view )
1 floor is about 3,3 m . So 232 m convert to 232/3.3=70
The highest building in Montreal (by number of floor) is la Tour des Canadiens 2 with 53. So with 70 floor there still room to grow.
232 m is the height of the Mont-Royal. I'm pretty sure that the by-law already prevent construction higher than the mountain.
Finally, I don't think with the uncertainty of return to work downtown vs work from home, no developer will want to build a skyscraper any time soon. In the end it's a virtue signaling saying I'll fight the big developers.
Thank you, Val√©rie.
I'm glad we're focusing on the impotent(tee-hee‚ò∫Ô∏è) things in elections these days...

Good. How about that police budget?
This is such a dumb regulation. Can off island communities such as Brossard etc go above 232m?
D'un c√¥t√©, il y a amplement de places pour faire des grattes-ciels de cette hauteur l√† et moins et continuer √† densifier la ville. De l'autre, la raison est un peu niaiseuse ~~comme sa mairesse~~
Coderre is from the "old Liberal Party" the one responsible for the [Sponsorship scandal](https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2012/11/05/hbert_ghosts_of_quebec_sponsorship_scandal_still_floating_around.html).
Codere was also defending the Chief of Police when he [illegally spied on a Quebec journalist](https://www.rcinet.ca/en/2016/11/07/montreal-mayor-denies-political-interference-in-police-spying-on-journalist/).
Coderre is also into the habit of using the Montreal police as his own private police force, which bit him in the ass in the case of the [fake "porn fraud" case](https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/media-attention-a-factor-in-conditional-discharge-for-denis-coderres-son) involving his son.
Or that [$25,000 bribe Coderre got from a Laval businessman](https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/police-investigating-25000-given-to-mayor-denis-coderre-when-he-was-an-mp) when Coderre was a Liberal MP...
**An "old political wolf" like Coderre has not changed and will not change.**
Honestly the quality of life is better outside of downtown
The "Plan M√©tropolitain d'am√©nagement et developpement" puts forward densification objectives bades on Transport Oriented Developments (TODs). What that means is densify within a 1 km radius to a public transport hub. 
Theres also major environmental and economic development orientationa in there. 
That plan was signed by Montreal and all of the CMM affiliated municipities. Its up to us to hold the mayors to it I guess. Unfortunate that almost noone actually know about the thing in the first place.
> And also, why aren't we talking about densification outside of downtown? That's where the real issue is in my opinion.
Densification outside of downtown and of downtown itself are inexorably linked.
Cities follow natural formulas. So much so that bacterial colonies actually grow in much the same way as cities do. 
One of the natural features of cities is that they have a dense core, and density tapers off as you move away from the core.
Additionally, average building height increases systematically with city size/population.
When you put these two facts together, it becomes rather obvious that to increase the density outside of the core, the density of the core must also increase.
A limit on maximum building height is a limit on density in the core. A limit on density in the core is a limit on density outside of the core. A limit on density outside of the core is a limit on the maximum size of the city.
You aren't going to get a city of mainly medium density. It just doesn't happen. Trying to do so is to turn Montreal and its people into Guinea pigs.
Guinea pigs in an experiment that is likely to fail when the only reason to run the experiment is to appease the NIMBY community.
No thanks.

J'aimerais √ßa que plus de gens comprennent √ßa de m√™me. Coderre n'est pas un bon maire pour Montr√©al. On n'a pas besoin de ses id√©es de grandeur qui ne vont que faire profiter des promoteurs et des gros riches propri√©taires d'√©quipes sportives et d'√©v√®nements.
Les grandes tours de verre du centre-ville, √ßa va faire. √áa fait rien d'autre qu'enlaidir la ville. √áa n'a aucun aspect esth√©tique. Et de toute fa√ßon c'est juste des condos de luxe de 400-500pi carr√© √† une chambre pis des bachelor ou des gros penthouses que personne n'est capable de payer. C'est juste des immeubles √† investissement.
Y faut d√©velopper les quartiers comme le Mile-End, le Plateau, Rosemont, Hochelaga, Mercier, etc. Faisons des √©difices √† condo de 4 √† 6 √©tages avec des unit√©s √† 2-3 chambres √† coucher √† dimension humaines de plus de 800pi carr√©. Pas besoin d'√™tre du gros luxe comme mat√©riel non plus. Des comptoirs de quartz ou de marbre on peu s'en passer. Et engagez des architectes qui ont du flair pour faire des √©difices color√©s avec des formes int√©ressantes, pis des grands balcons!
C'est faisable. Y sont capable de le faire en Europe avec de l'espace limit√©. On peut certainement le faire ici.

Et qqun se demandait ce a quoi allait ressembler le sub pendant les √©lections. Ca n'aura pas pris longtemps...
There is a not downtown? Since when? Why didn‚Äôt anyone tell anyone!?!?
You mean we can have high rises on the plateau?
Edit: downvotes from NIMBY?
I'm OK with high rises and letting the city grow UP (as oppose to just further & further out). 
In fact a lot of environmental policies seem to feel high rise condos are better for the environment vs. individual housing. 
But if we going to have high rises - make them family friendly 3+ bedrooms & spacious & affordable of course.
Use the space saved to invest in parks.

Various article on high rises and affordable housing:
**High-rise housing construction as a way of solving the problem of providing people with comfortable habitation**
 [https://www.e3s-conferences.org/articles/e3sconf/pdf/2018/08/e3sconf\_hrc2018\_03028.pdf](https://www.e3s-conferences.org/articles/e3sconf/pdf/2018/08/e3sconf_hrc2018_03028.pdf)
>The construction of monolithic buildings, in which is used cellular concrete instead of the standard concrete can be cost-effective. This kind of building material while maintaining the strength improves thermal insulation and facilitates the design of the house and this solves the problem of the quality of mobile communication that occurs in the monolithic structures.  
>  
>Thus, the implementation of large-scale housing projects in modern high-rise construction requires a combination of innovative technologies that allow creating a comfortable environment for consumers and a wide range of capabilities for developers and they will receive not only the gratitude from consumers, but also the financial gain. The construction of high-rise buildings allows attracting more than 80% of extrabudgetary financing, solving the social problem of improving the living conditions of citizens and promises profit to investors.

More people than you think believe that the only way to solve the ¬´ crise du logement ¬ª is to increase the amount of apartment available to rent. So yeah, a considerable amount of people think it's a dumb policy and that it should be changed so that you don't need to compete with 12 couples for a 4 1/2.
Look only to nyc with their ugly super tall condo buildings near Central Park that almost every New Yorker hates. Montreal has a nice skyline and there‚Äôs room for hundreds of more 40-50 story towers before we ever have to think about going taller
[deleted]
How so?
> la hauteur ne change *absolument* rien quant a la vue de la montagne a partir de la ville
C'est l'inverse, c'est la vue de la ville √† partir de la montagne. L'id√©e √©tant que la "meilleure" vue de Montr√©al est celle du Mont-Royal, accessible gratuitement, et non celle (payante) des observatoires des grattes-ciel.
Les gens ne semblent pas comprendre que il y a deux choses en jeux, la vue du mont-royal √† partir de plusieurs points strat√©giques √† travers la ville d√©j√† d√©termin√©s (certains axes comme Rachel et des endroits comme la place Vauquelin) et la vue √† partir du belvedere kondiaronk sur certains point d'int√©r√™t  (vu sur le pont jacque-cartier comme example) ce n'est pas tous les vues sur le mont-royal qui sont prot√©g√©es, sinon on en finirais pu. 
La hauteur maximal n'as presque rien √† avoir avec les vues prot√©g√©es √† part sur quelle que dizaine de site tr√®s sp√©cifique. Rien de plus haut que le mont-royal c'est arbitraire et √ßa n'as rien √† avoir avec la protections des vues.
Pourquoi construit-on toujours les grate-ciels juste en face de la montagne qui donne son nom √† la ville ?
On pourrait suivre l'exemple de Paris et aller foutre √ßa √† Laval. Messemble que cr√©er un autre vrai centre aurait des r√©percussions positive pour le dynamisme et le transport de l'ensemble de la r√©gion m√©tropolitaine. √Ä moins qu'il y ait un r√®glement municipal par rapport √† la fus√©e du Cosmodome üôÉ
Pretty much
Everyone in ny hates the new super tall condo towers built on billionaires row. 
When some asshole builds an 80 story building, it will quite literally ruin the Montreal skyline for decades..
There‚Äôs room for hundreds of my pvm height buildings in Montreal, hundreds upon hundreds. We are nowhere near needing to increase height limits. It‚Äôs insane
> It's not like the park is ruined by being surrounded by skyscrapers
Strongly disagree. Sunlight. Sunset. View of the city.
How often do you go to the park? Is it possible you don't care much about this because it's not part of your life?
Wat
De rel√¢cher les r√®gles de zonage entre autres.
Regarde le vieux angus, c'est tr√®s dense mais √ßa ne d√©passe pas 4 √©tages. La solution c'est entre autre de proposer des appartements mais de qualit√©. Pas des condos faits a la va vite comme dans griffin town 
Je te laisse la vid√©o suivante qui donne des pistes sur la densification sans d√©passer 4 √©tages. 
https://youtu.be/HXZ_0wOY96E
Juste pour pr√©cision, le 232m est bas√© sur la hauteur maximal par rapport au niveau de la mer. Donc d√©pendant d'o√π tu te trouve sur l'√Æle, la hauteur maximal de la tour varie selon la topographie du terrain.
Par exemple, la tour du Canadiens 2 est b√¢ti sur un terrain qui est d√©j√† √† 36 m au-dessus du niveau de la mer.

Housing/construction rules are absolutely the important things, unless you want rents here to go the way of Toronto
It's been a while since my last Montreal model, but I hope everyone likes this one.
I was driving down Ste. Catherine street with my daughter eons ago and as we passed by on the other side of the street she asked me this: "Is that a Barbie store? Can we go inside?"
never been there but always thought the sign was kinda cool!  
Sadly I think it closed and there is a rumor that Apple will move there to have more space!
This is so f'n cool. I hope you post pics of more landmarks and maybe even a series of your older ones.
It's very cool, but I don't think you need to include this one as post-apocalyptic. For now just call it 1:48 scale.
*very* fucking cool. Keep creating.
This is the most awesome thing I've seen in a long time following
It always reminds me of a place out of a Gaspar No√© movie.
Beautiful work !!
Reminds me that a french Metal group have a song named Super sexe because of that sign. They wrote it after seeing it in Montreal after one of their tour here. The band's name is Ultra Vomit and they do kind of parodic metal.
Mr. X likes the sexy times as well I see.
Even the crowd is on point.
Nice work!!
Do you have a portfolio for the other landmarks?
Ahhh que de souvenirs. Aussi √©trange que √ßa puisse para√Ætre, ils avaient un bon buffet le midi, au Super Sexe.
Maintenant, go go Caf√© Cl√©o! Ou les Foufs? J'h√©site.
Next Fallout landmark obv. :p
Super cool! Bravo!
√áa vient de me rappeler d√®s soir√©es m√©morables.
omfg this is perfect!
Awesome job
Tes projets sont tous franchement r√©ussis, bravo!
Perso, ce serait une oeuvre que j'exposerais fi√®rement chez moi.
√áa me fait penser au travail d'Abigail Goldman.
haha let me know if you need access to a 3d printer in Montreal mate <3
It's maybe my favorite Montreal sign. So cheesy, so dated, so fun.
Lol trust me, nothing of value was lost
I've never been inside myself either, I just love the sign.
I wonder if I they‚Äôll put the sign up for auction.
If there's enough response I might do just that. In the meantime you can find my earlier projects on my profile here.
Thanks! I worked really hard on this one. If there's enough response, I may finish up my Biosphere remains.
Thanks, I'm really proud of how it came out. :)
Thanks! I'll have to look up their work.
Lol, good eye!
That probably took the most work for this model, but it was probablythe most fun too. I custom made every model from video game meshes, reposed them in Blender, printed them out, and then painted them.
Thanks! It's probably one of the more difficult models I've made, I'm really proud of it!
You can check my post history, they're back there somewhere. Otherwise, there's  some stuff on insta at apocalypse_montreal.
Premi√®rement, je pense que je vais essayer de compl√©ter mon mod√®le de biosph√®re. Peut-√™tre Foufs apr√®s √ßa.
Merci!
Thanks, I had a lot of fun making this one. :)
Merci! Just looked up Abigail Goldman, you're right! Her stuff is so great.
I'm rocking an Elegoo Saturn here, it goes whoosh-whoosh. But thanks!
Start with Enter the Void :)
I need all of these Montreal sets for Kill Team lol
Ah, I've seen that one! Just didn't recognize the name behind it. I'd probably have to admit that the film likely had some small subconscious influence on this project, all the neon and crazy dancers and such.
Never tried it, these are for Gaslands and Cyberpunk Red. Is it fun?
It brought me back to the sequences where his friend brings him to a psychedelic building model builder's home.
Again, awesome stuff!

I saw the cops drive up in vans towards St Cat's, get out and immediately start shooting tear gas into a crowd of people celebrating. They absolutely were not rioting at the time and there were children in the crowd.
The police didn't even give a warning before they started with the gas, I'm not surprised it got bad after that crazy escalation.
Cops came in and tear gassed the crowd before any violence occured. Needless escalation.
It's the no warning before kettling and pepper spraying people over and over (children included) for me!
Chu d'accord avec ceux qui disent que la police a lanc√© les lacrimog√®nes trop vite. J'√©tais coin Ren√©-Levesque/Drummond, plut√¥t loin du char flipp√© (McDo Centre Bell). Quelques tar√©s lan√ßaient des bi√®res sur la police mais l'ensemble de la foule sautait et criait pacifiquement. Aucun avertissement et boom on se fait lancer du tear gas. C'tait moyen en criss.
Un gars grimpe dans un poteau, un autre lance une bouteille: √áa justifie de gazer et brutaliser 10 000 civils 5 rues plus loin
On a reparl√© derni√®rement ici du probl√®me que 87% des policiers du SPVM n'√©taient m√™me pas des r√©sidents de Montr√©al
C'est pour √ßa que c'est un probl√®me.
Les gars de Groupe d'Intervention rentrent sur l'√Æle de Montr√©al avec la m√™me mentalit√© hostile qu'un marine qui d√©barque √† Fallujah: Quand ils sont chez nous √† Montr√©al, ils consid√®rent que toute la population locale est hostile et organis√©e comme une arm√©e. Et que c'est justifi√© d'attaquer violemment des gens qui n'ont rien fait, comme si on √©tait tous des soldats d'une arm√©e ennemie et que c'√©tait *fair* de se d√©fouler en frappant sur des civils au hasard pour se venger de l'humiliation d'une de leurs voitures endommag√©e.
√áa sert √† rien de leur expliquer que les gens qui marchent vers le m√©tro n'ont rien √† voir avec ceux qui ont ab√Æm√© leur belle voiture, pour les policiers banlieusards du SPVM tous les montr√©alais sont interchangeables et c'est leur droit de nous violenter quand ils sont de mauvaise humeur.
Ironiquement, eux-m√™mes sont litt√©ralement √ßa une arm√©e avec des uniformes et une cha√Æne de commandement et refusent de se responsabiliser quand un de leurs membres commet des crimes contre la population. C'est de l'ultra double standards √ßa.
Good video of how police shoot teargas randomly in the crowd: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qvAyYj86Y8
Just your normal St Jean party üòÇ
Anybody else saw the hit and run that happened outside the bell centre after the police fired the initial tear gas?
Saw a car crash into pedestrians while being chased by an agry mob. 
Anybody have any videos or updates on that?
Rookie numbers. Give it a couple weeks
Fuck the cops , throwing Lacrymo without warning is literally asking the crowd to get hostile.
If it was the fans that started it first and created violence let‚Äôs say that. But it was not, it was the cops that threw teargas before any person did anything. People were celebrating and happy and that‚Äôs it. The flipped cop car was in retaliation because the cops threw the gas first. This is the only actual truth of what happened.
N'oublions pas les gentils f√™tards qui ont emp√™ch√©s les v√©hicules d'urgence de se rendre sur des interventions.  Bien gentil de grimper sur des camions de pompiers (vid√©o inclus) et sur le top d'ambulances pour les immobiliser.

Just like in 2010-2012. I thought we'd be better. Both the fans and the SPVM
Sounds like Montreal
Remember when Bush came to Montreal and told Bernard Landry he was impressed by our cops for repressing so efficiently during some summit?
It's a regular event, nothing to see here move along.
[deleted]
As far as Montreal hockey riots go, this did not get bad at all.
power tripping cops need something to do now that they can't ticket peaceful night walkers
Are you saying they starting spraying the crowd *before* a cop car got flipped over?
This was incredibly tame compared to what it was in 2010 for example or 2012. So maybe the police tactics worked as intended.
I got cought in it at Rene Levesque and Drummond, no one was doing anything menacing to the cops, just some fireworks closer to the intersection from us and people climbing the poles. Once we got a whiff of the gas we ran.
this is really it. The police shot first.
I was in the crowd at the bell center and didn‚Äôt understand why people were running my way and then I felt the pepper spray. I assume they started using pepper spray when the car got flipped but that‚Äôs my assumption. Wouldn‚Äôt it make sense to warn people through a speaker phone that they will be using tear gas to those that do not follow their instructions‚Ä¶. I was highly disappointed with them last night. They acted like bullies all over downtown. People were celebrating at Dorchester square and all of sudden more pepper spray‚Ä¶.
Ah so the police rioted
Not true. Tear gas was thrown after things started to get out of hand. Stop spreading bullshit
I was there. Some people actually flipped a police car and bashed in the windows. I believe the police started throwing the tear gas canisters after that. I think they did too much though; I was very far from where the accident actually happened and over the span of a few minutes, 2 tear gas canisters were thrown at a 5 to 10 meter range from me. Where I was, the crowd was peaceful, just celebrating and jumping around...
I was there. People were blowing fireworks in massive crowds, throwing cans at the cops and breaking sign posts. Shit was starting to hit the fan. Throwing tear gas was absolutely the best way to disperse the crowd before further escalation
[deleted]
Stop spreading false info.
I‚Äôd avoid bringing children to the Bell Center going forward. Regardless of who shot first, there was going to be violence no matter what, there‚Äôs always riots when the Habs make the playoffs.
This shouldn't come as a surprise, the spvm did the same thing against students in 2012
They're so angry they can't just go rolling into parks and fuck with people anymore. This was a perfect chance to flex their muscles again.
Quand les cops s'habillent en costume d'√©meute, on peut √™tre s√ªr qu'y'aura une √©meute, [d'une sorte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_riot)
I'm sure you're right. But I'm also confident that had they waited longer, the odds are shit would have gotten out of hand and would have been worse. 
Breaking up everything too early and making innocent people feel annoyed is a decent price to pay in order to avoid mayhem.
The truth is, in big crowds, it's often mostly innocent people, but the crowds fuel the riot people. And if you leave it longer, they get more drunk, and feed off themselves. 
If you break everything up way too early. People will be bummed, but you refused any riots before they even got going. 
Which is good. If you wait for them to get going, now you have riots. 
Canadiens fans on st-jean making the final, the likelihood of riots was pretty fucking high lol. Even if they hadn't started to be in full bloom yet.
And you know, that's someone's shop maybe that was saved by acting too early.
Forreal, i was there and they were just straight up charging and hitting random people when they decided to clear a street. You barely got a warning, yhey just get off the bus, blow a whistle and then its instant chaos...
They were shooting the fucking teargas straight upwards, no way they were aiming at anything and they vould easily have seriously hurt some innocent habs fan for no good reason
Crowd acting like a bunch of idiots and then for some reason when things calm down, tear gas drops.

Was it the silver car with the Italian flags?
With the amount of people that were out there yesterday, it's bound to happen.
Yeah like 15 arrests?  ?  What was that?  Amateur hour?
I don't know about that, I didn't see the car get flipped. I'm saying the people I saw those cops shoot at weren't doing anything, it was unprovoked. 
There were thousands of people there, thousands of people didn't flip a cop car, a few assholes did.  It's not an excuse to gas unconnected people including children, without even a warning.
It also wasn't one massive crowd, there were pockets of people all over downtown, the cops were tear gassing all of them.
Oh yeah absolutely! The cop car flip was a retaliation from pised fans that the cops yeeted a metric fuckton of tear gas to disperse the crowds without even trying basic things, like asking or guiding traffic, first.
I agee, the fans need a 2 minute coincidental minor penalty to accompany the 4 minute major and subsequent game misconduct / suspension for the SPVM

If you care about your car, I would get a dual dashcam installed (something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/VAVA-1920x1080P-2560x1440P-G-Sensor-Recording/dp/B07R5MBNZ7)) and make sure it turns on when it detects movement / some kind of impact even when the car is idle. Then tell these people to fuck off.
If you don't care about your car, just tell them to fuck off.
People oddly possesive of the space they don't own in front of their street. My suggestion would be to either ignore them outright and be passive aggressive and smile and say 'have a wonderful day!", or just politely tell them that there are no parking restrictions and you need somewhere to park. If you become hostile, you may get your car keyed.
And brace yourself for next winter's fun!
I feel you. I hate these assholes who won't even use their own empty fucking driveway ffs. They can fuck all the way off.
> Also, almost none of them park their cars in their own driveaway, 
this is typically italian.  the driveway has to be cleared of cars so the old man can hose it down the entire afternoon.
I suggest keeping this conversation as short as possible because you are clearly not dealing with people who have a rational relationship to stuff.
I'm thinking something along the lines of : "The no parking signs decide where you can park. Same for me."
Also, I agree with the suggestion in this thread to get a dashcam. People who don't have enough sense to know where their property ends probably don't have enough sense to know when they're wrong.
Tell them to fuck off, they‚Äôre not going to do a damn thing.  Don‚Äôt allow yourself to be bullied.
How else are they going to water their driveway if their own cars are in it?
Show who‚Äôs the man park in their driveway lol.
I once had a guy turn on his sprinkler when I left my windows down. From that moment on I purposely parked in front of his house every time, but with my windows up. Unless he can show me he owns the concrete that everyone‚Äôs taxes paid for I couldn‚Äôt give a shit what he thinks
Demandez a un voisin qui vous aimes de partir une rumeur comme de quoi vous etes un peu violent et d√©rang√©.
This type of shit happens in any duplex neighborhood.  What starts out as a young couple owning a duplex turns into an old couple with douche kids that wont move out.  Cars multiply from 1-2 to 3-4.  Then they get older and you end up with 3 generations in one house....all having cars.  So there's no room for your car, there's no room for the neighbors car, or their hanger on kids.  All out fight.
If you live in a duplex apartment, you are destined to park far from your apartment.
I didn‚Äôt even finish reading your story that this took me back to when I lived in Verdun. We used to call my neighbor The Mayor of the street. People there were crazy about anyone parking in front of their duplexes. It was insane. And forget about the winter, God help you if you came home at the end of the day parked in a spot they  cleaned at 8am! I had my tires slashed TWICE! Also that neighbor, who was like 60 and still living with her much more elderly parents, had the audacity to apply for a handicapped parking spot in front of her duplex under the pretense she was the main driver for her parents. That was the biggest BS in the world. In the 4 years I lived there I saw here drive her parents maybe twice. So anyway handicapped sign was installed on the street almost right next to where I live and when my parents came to visit they would park in that handicapped spot (because they had a permit on their car). Once she even came to ring the doorbell. I told her to go pound and and call the cops!
Just ignore them. They don‚Äôt own the road. I would tell them nicely ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but this is public property. I‚Äôm allowed to park here‚Äù
Just wave and tell them to have a nice day, and then walk away.
I‚Äôd say try to resolve this ASAP 
When winter arrives and there‚Äôs snow and snowbanks it will be war
I have no real solution for you - I made friends with my neighbour who saves me a spot so that none of the other neighbours park near his house lol 
otherwise, just tell them to mind their own business. arguing about parking is the only thing the retirees have going on in life.
Have them lookup the criminal definition of harassment and ask them "do we need the police to get involved or can we settle this like civilized human beings/neighbours?"
A lot of old Italian women look out the window all day long in St. Leo and Rivieres des Prairies. They freak the fuck out when people park in front of their house. I honestly feel bad for them, thankfully my grandmother is not one of them.
Be careful, You never know who these old Italians are related to.
Be polite
I've been there know how you feel. Firstly don't let it get you down, THEY clearly have insecurities that need many sessions from a professional. Secondly probably the most important is to have your car monitored by either camera or gps in case it disappears or gets damaged. Hope this helps, remember to not let it get to you.
Welcome to St-Leonard. Most folks there won't even accept a tree on the city right-of-way in front of their house. I wouldn't be surprised if certain homeowners washed the portion of the street in front of their house. In St-Leonard, being a property owner definitely evokes an intense air of entitlement. Best of luck.
Having lived my entire childhood in St-Leonard as a person of Italian origins, this is a common old Italian man fixation bordering on obsession, the spot in front of their house although in the public portion of the street is "their" spot. The parking mafia... And I wish I was joking...
All this being said, they might throw empty threats and the malocchio your way but I doubt they'd damage your car. Goodluck!
The games people play with their cars. It is common for people with a driveway to park in front instead. The excuse is the driveway is for the second car, which is in the garage, or for kids visiting etc.
Instead of escalation, you can maybe ask what their problem is with parking in this exact spot. If they have to explain that they prefer to park in front of their house, maybe explain that you live here too and also need a place to park. You tell em you don't want trouble, you just want to park close-ish to where you live. That being said, I know that people get really heated about parking, especially when it seems like there aren't enough spots to go around.
I live in a duplex and the garage is full of the owner's old stuff so no one can park there. The driveway is shared by the duplex a cot√© and that guy parks in the driveway all the time, and also has a garage full of (what I consider to be) junk. Luckily parking is never an issue on my block, however.
>I also found some new scratch marks on my car recently...
Camera time. If you catch someone on camera that will probably solve your problems real quick.
But for real I feel awful for you. How goddam selfish do these people have to be? They have driveways! What kind of car did you get?
This week I got death threats from the garage owner because I parked in his spot (he always park is wrecker in that spot which is on the public street). No no-parking signs and not a drive way. The fucker called stationnement Montreal and they gave me a ticket that I will fight in court. When I was reading the ticket he came out of the garage and started with the threat on my life and promised me he was gonna break my car. So yeah, I dont know where to go from there as I am twice his size but cant start surveilling my car 24/7.
Edit: the garage is 70m from my house
I bought a bicycle.
That was the mentality on my street until the borough implemented vignettes.
Somehow it made those neighbours, who thought they owned the street parking in front of their property, realise that they didn't own those spots, the city did.
I don‚Äôt understand, are you the only person on the street without your own parking space? Is that not a common occurence for them?
What are they suggesting you do exactly?
a) Make friends with your neighbor so he lets you park in front of his empty driveway
b) Tell them you are sorry but the street is public and you have to park somewhere. If you had your own parking you‚Äôd use it.
Maybe they think you have a driveway but dont want to use it? weird.
Echoing other commenters, yes, this a problem in Saint-Leonard, some people create all sorts of drama for no reason with regard to driveways/parking.
Add excessive lawn cutting maintenance to the list too. In the summertime there's always some kind of machinery running.
People also activate their car alarm from their living room window for no reason if they see you doing something they don't like. & Calling the city to try and get bylaws enforced for every single little thing. Retired people with nothing better to do.  
Considering they should be lucky compared to the clusterfuck of parking in more apartment-packed places, they should consider themselves lucky, but instead they like to complain.
Park wherever it's legal, and fuck off. Parking is an issue in all Montreal and everyone wants to park in front of their house but that ain't possible.

You just can't win with these people. Only sensible thing to do is to move to a better neighborhood if you have the option.
Move to better neighborhood, you can't win fighting with neighbors.
Give them cannoli!
Talk to them, listen to them, get to know them, jest with them.  DON'T MOVE the car.  When they ask you to move the car, be polite, firm, and brief.  State in a strong voice "NO" you will not move the car.  Don't explain, just walk away.  Repeat over and over.  If they insult you, pretend you didn't hear, makes it easier for them to communicate with you next time.  After a while, if they ask nicely, and it's convenient for you, you can move the car :-)   Good luck.
Make it your territory, piss on all the cars. Show them who's the boss.
I'd say whenever they look at you or get mad at you face them. Like hey what's wrong? Where do I park if not here? I'm already parking super far from my house. The street isn't yours you don't own it. What's the issue? 
Just face them. What's the worst they can do? Vandalize your car? Have cameras ready and report to the cops if they do anything.
You have every right to park as you do. Put a sign on your car that says under surveillance and remove it when driving around. They are not looking for any trouble....
Ask them if you can park in their driveway if they don't use it. 
I had a neighbor who thought he own the small alleyway we had behind our apartment but we checked and our landlord was owning it. We only parked their to unload our stuff and get out as soon as we were finished but he would come out yelling at us with his broom and patrolled the neighborhood afterwardsüòÇ if he saw us in the windows while he was washing his car (and the alleyway), he would spray water in them.  We almost got into a fight once. I was at a family meeting and multiple people who once lived in the neighborhood knew him. Crazy old man üòÇ
Come to the suburbs. I can fit 5 cars in my driveway and have ample street parking
OK brace yourselves people:
As a homeowner I'll admit I once got slightly annoyed when a neighbour from the next block would park his enormous and ugly landscaping truck in front of my house because BAM there it was every time I looked out my windows. I'll admit that for a week I even passive aggressively parked on the street in front of my house, so I wouldn't have to stare at his ugly truck. 
But to get out and yell at you is a new level of crazy!
Up here in Canada. We can park in the street, unless there are signs prohibiting it. There are a ton of immigrants in my area, and they seem to be possessive of the spots in front of their house. To the point that one truck owner almost took legal action over the homeowner damaging his truck.
Geez I wish I had an quick and easy answer for you.. I think you get those types wherever you are. Same sort of situation where I am! Add to that the snow removal in the winter when they make huge mountains taking up many parking spots! Infuriating!
I generally don't like confrontation so I just continue doing my (legal) thing and they can suck on a lemon if they don't like it.. I don't think there's much we can do. I know this doesn't help but just wanted to let you know I share your frustration..
1. Install the dashcam that the top commenter in this thread recommended.
2. Politely but firmly confront them and explain that you have every right as them to park wherever you've been parking.
3. Inform them that you're monitoring your car 24x7 and that you will go to any length to pursue damages in court should anything happen to your car.
They would be foolish to do anything (passive-aggressive or aggressive) other than backing TF off.
Living in and dealing with Montr√©al parking on island is frustrating and nuts at the best of times. Add some silly neighbours .. boils my blood. I escalate things and ur story upset me so my advice wouldn‚Äôt be too good but I do hope u find a way to coexist with silly ppl. But bullies oughta be bullied back. Keeps them mofos in check, ya feel. Best of luck !
Had a neighbour that had the same mindset as your wonderful neighbours. My dad got fed up one day because of a similar parking situation , he then cracked and said ‚ÄúOh congrats phill , didn‚Äôt know you owned part of the fucking city‚Äù
They are fucking with you obviously, they don‚Äôt have any kind of legal right to do so of course, so I suggest a trick that works every time I use it: Just tell them ¬´¬†You‚Äôre not happy? Call the police!¬†¬ª. It will be the last time they will bug you with whatever! 
If you think they may need a warning I would also tell them: ¬´¬†You touch my car, I will either call the police or burn down your house, haven‚Äôt decided yet!¬†¬ª (haven‚Äôt tried that one yet I never needed it...) (I would call the police right away if I were you if they threaten your car in any way)
"Monsieur, la voie publique ne vous appartient pas. Les panneaux de la ville me disent que j'ai le droit de me stationner ici. \[edit baveux, si tu le feel: *Si vous avez la bonne id√©e de venir ab√Æmer mon char, ma dashcam va m'envoyer votre face*.\] Bonne journ√©e, l√†!" is short and to the point.

C'est tu moi ou le logo de ville de Montr√©al est encore vintage? Lol
These are great! Thanks for the throwback! I remembers classics like, BOCA, Heritage (supermarket), Au coton, Stitches, and PicNic!
these are so great. my mom still called it cumberland for years after they closed.
Le logo de la communaut√© urbaine!
Wow you did Cumberland! Much respect lol I love these! I recognize every single one except for Color Your World.
Have you done Simpson‚Äôs yet? Or the M store (there was one in Alexis Nihon. It became Zellars, then Target and now Canadian Tire).
Love this stuff.

I think ~~last~~first and only time i got pulled over was about 4 years ago for a stop i rolled through. Been driving for about 10 years. 15 times in a month is insane...seems like they do it to fuck with him since he filed complaints.
This is my favorite part 
"We don't have systemic racism," RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki
To have the audacity to bullshit to that extent is beyond me I hope she sleeps ok at night.
le racisme syst√©mique has entered the chat
certains commentaires sont d√©gueulasses/stupides/racistes
He started to check his lights when cops started to pull him over for having a light out when it isn't even out or other bullshit reasons
Of course a conversation that should have been about systemic racism ended up being about the French language.
People commenting on this article across all platforms are sure quick to comment on the Mercedes and tracksuit like Montreal police couldn‚Äôt be just as easily profiling rich mafia-esque or white bearded biker looking guys with that logic. an absolute straw man fallacy, come on Quebec
> In¬†2019, [a report ](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/spvm-racial-profiling-report-recommendations-and-findings-1.5311589)commissioned by the City of Montreal that looked into street checks, found Indigenous people and Black people were four to five times more likely than white people to be stopped by police. 
I really wish these kinds of statements came with more context. How much of that is bullshit like this guy getting stopped for cleaning his car and being ticketed for drunk driving and how much is that poor areas have more crime and more minorities thus more more police interaction.
You know, if the police were really upset over being called racist, they could try not being racist.
I've been pulled over three times in my life.  Once was actually to compliment me on my driving.  
I'm white though...I bet the number would be higher otherwise.
Btw, the quote about there being no systemic racism in "the force" comes from an RCMP spokesperson talking to the globe and mail while MacRae seems so have been harassed by Montreal police...bit of a weird way to report that.

Des ostie de crott√©s au SPVM
I was in an SUV in 2004 on Parc, 2 black guys in front, 3 white guys in back. Cops pulled us over for nothing. ID'd the two black guys, ignored me and the others, and accused them of being "des chefs de gang".
&#x200B;
Nope, no problem here.
Without coming across like a jerk but this guy is annoying as all hell. First off his Mercedes is a clapped 1st gen ML350 that is worth about 1000$. He lives or hangs out in my borough(around lasalle heights)  and is seen around. There is a giant speaker box blocking the rear window, tints as dark as night and has about 100000 poorly attached things on his car. His driving style is somewhat erratic as well. I'll have to dig though my dashcam videos but I know 100% I've seen him burn a stop sign(Corner St Patrick and Clement). While I might not like the cops I also understand how Caribbean folks get when you don't show respect or courtesy... So that doesn't help a situation. Yes Guyana is more Caribbean cultured vs usual South American culture
Continually playing victim seeking attention in the end causes you to lose credibility and just be seen as an attention seeking. I am not denying the major social/ racism issues on the force but continually banging on about how you are getting pulled over driving a 20 year old Benz is annoying. A new CLS500 or E63 AMGS ? Sure you've got my attention. I have a pretty good idea in my head how that recycling box incident went down vs what is being reported...
As for the SPVM? It's always worried that such a force is made up of some many white cops. Its truly staggering.. With many officers being some outside regions of Montreal. We should be demanding that more cops come from within the community they serve rather than tossing in more white cops that don't understand certain areas of town or certain races of people. Do you think the young kid in lets say MTL north wants to be a cop when he sees his father or family being harassed by two white cops on a power trip? Hell no.. that kid will automatically hate the police. A perfect example of cops on a powertrip is the curfew restrctions. Imagine being black, out after curfew?
Je suis Albanais et on as souvent des noms comme Mustafa ou Samir.
Chaque fois que je me fais stopper par la police, une fois qu'ils voient que je suis caucasien (blanc), on dirait qu'ils se disent "c'est bon, laisse faire, bonne soir√©e lol".
Pour √™tre honn√™te, je travaillais avec un gars qui avait l'air de lui en terme de look, mais il √©tait blanc. Et il se faisait arr√™ter sans raison par la police plusieurs fois par semaine. Pis il roulait en Impala et non en Mercedes. Et pas aussi pire, mais je travaillais plus r√©cemment avec un gars de 50 ans qui ne s'habillait pas de m√™me, mais qui avait l'air d'un petit criss, et il roulait dans une grosse Mercedes, pis lui aussi se fait harceler.
Je me mets √† la place du policier...si tu t'habilles en gangster pis que tu roules en Mercedes, je me dirais que les chances que je trouves un gun ou de la drogue dans le char sont passablement √©lev√©es...
Well there's his problem. Turning around a car inspecting it is suspicious as fuck lol
Who does that? Be honest here. Absolutely no one.
> McRae, who was a police officer in his native Guyana, moved to Montreal in 2006. He'd initially hoped to continue his career in policing, but he doesn't speak French, which ruled out that possibility. 
Um
edit: what a rollercoaster this was
Try to do that when driving a Mercedes while black. Your mileage WILL vary...
S√©rieux. Je me suis fait arr√™t√©...... attends.... 2 fois en.... 9 ans? Et les 2 fois c'√©tait vraiment ma faute.
Virage √† droite ill√©gal √† un endroit vraiment pas √©vident en construction (pas de ticket, avertissement seulement) et exc√®s de vitesse une fois. Le policier a m√™me r√©duit l'amende pour l'exc√®s de vitesse pour √™tre gentil avec moi.
Ce que vit ce dude, c'est d√©bile.
Il ya quelque ann√©e mon p√®re √©tait malade alors il lui on enlever son permis de conduire. Pendant 2-3 mois j'ai conduis sont char, je ne suis fait arr√™ter 5 fois a Longueuil et les 3 fois que j'ai passer les douanes je me suis fait envoyer avec des gardes qui √©tait de moins en moins polis.

"You're an asshole!"
RCMP: No i'm not!
"It's not your opinion, asshole!"
tu comprends meme pas ton propre concept de racisme syst√©mique. Des individus racistes ou des individus qui nient l'existence du racisme syst√©mique ne constituent pas un system de racisme.
That part was wild, imagine every single time you go out, having to check to make sure that if a cop pulled you over for having a light out, you'd be able to confirm or deny if it was working when you got in.
When I lived in an apartment with underground parking, I used to try and tell if my brake lights were working by their glow on the wall, but even now I know that wouldn't hold up compared to what this guy does.
It's absolute insane that people like the person in the article and premier legault can say we don't have systemic racism here when this man is proof of it.
I totally agree. This is a different problem and the language debate was very uncalled for.
T'es pas en train d'aider, buddy.

Tu r√©alises que c'est l'article lui-m√™me qui lance le bal pour parler de la langue?
Well, of course. In Qu√©bec, we are racist because we reject Anglicizing.
[deleted]
They don't. Because rich mafia esque type have money for good lawyers and are harder to bully. Also, they are not black, wheras we know that a certain proportion of cops are racist and take great pleasure in targeting blacks / immigrants. 
Also if you've been living under a rock, a study came out in 2019 I think and it was talked about a lot in the news. The study pointed out that black people have something like 4 to 5 times more chance of being routinely arrested in traffic for no reason. So yeah you just said a whole bunch of nothing
https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.5311589
> like Montreal police couldn‚Äôt be just as easily profiling rich mafia-esque or white bearded biker looking guys with that logic.
...C'est exactement ce qu'ils font. En passant. Lol.
Also, that study was about street checks, not stopping vehicles.
Yes, we need context. How many of those black people stopped were driving Mercedeses? (is that the proper plural?)
A cop pulled you over to compliment you on your driving? Need more info here.
>  Once was actually to compliment me on my driving. 
Funny. It happenned to me, too: I was riding my bike on the sidewalk, which is illegal, minding my own business as a cop car went by, and the cop congratulated me for dressing in day-glo clothing because it made me very visible. :)
EDIT: some other time, I was riding late at night, also in day-glo (it was summer, so it was just a construction safety vest), with reflectors galore (scotch-lite rims and forks, on the pedals and below handlebars and the seat), two headlights and two blinkers on the rear. In C√¥te-des-Neiges, I crossed a bunch of cops on bikes going the other way, and judging by the way one of them looked at me, he was really disappointed to not have any reason to ticket me...

Ignorant. It's not "habilles en gangster", it's black culture. Are they stopping white men in suits too that "habilles en mafia"? People should not be profiled on what they wear. They can wear whatever the fuck they want. They should only be pulled over for their actions and if the police have sufficient evidence. In this we see the police trying to make up ridiculous arguments that he had a broken light. Come on man, you're delusional.

Anyone who is following the advice of Quebec's now-mandatory driving course for drivers first licenced in the last decade or so. They explicitly encourage drivers to do a walk-around inspection each time, both as a general good practice and due to the harsh weather and road conditions here.
Source: took CAA-Quebec's version of that in 2018 and 2019. I don't do it most of the time now, but during in-car lessons and soon after licensure, I absolutely did.
Also, any Black driver who realizes that some racist cops look for any reason they can think of to pull them over, at far higher rates than whites. Verifying that the car is in good condition reduces how many legitimate excuses the cops can identify to justify their bigotry, or phrased another way, increases the ability to contest any tickets or charges that result from the discriminatory stop.
i love that this is labeled under "gastronomie" but it is. 
by far the best falafel ive had in north america. and let me tell you, the secret is in the pita... the guy who runs it used to have a pita company in montreal, abu lafia. 
walked in wth my gf the other day and she proposed that they cater our engagement party.... this is precisely why im marrying her!
Fuck me, this place is delicious. The falafel sandwich is the best in the city... try it with kosher pickles. World peace in a pita.
YO THE REAL ONES KNOW. FSJ IS A GEM.
No joke, I would order the shish taouk, and thought I was eating chicken for months until a friend told me it was all vegetarian. Love this place. The chocolate babka is also to die for! I spend way too much money when I go now cause I have to try new things every time.
One of the best sandwiches in the city, for sure. Don‚Äôt let the ‚Äúvegan‚Äù label turn you off, fellow omnivores. Their mint lemonade in the summer is great, and they‚Äôll have sufganiyot come Hanukkah.
The falafel pita is on point. Pro tip: Ask for fried eggplant in your sandwich. 
Also, their salad selections are great. Good options: Thai eggplant, brussel sprouts, quinoa salad, tabbouleh, cauliflower. 
I always leave with a medium sized container of hummus and a bag or two of pita. Their hummus is heavy on the tahini. Not everyone's cup of tea (my wife and kid don't love it).
Great Falafel and the lady at the counter is the best.
I was an OG. I lived nearby when they first opened a couple years ago and I went there pretty frequently.
I don't ever bother getting falafel from anywhere else. Nothing comes close, it's the real deal.  Also the owner speaks english, french, arabic and hebrew , welcomes like 99% of his customers in their own language.
:( MTL tu me manques.
I found out about them only recently through family recommendation. My goodness, it is the best falafel I've had outside of Israel, and somehow makes me even love halva! 
This place is a must
no parking and its mad ghetto area. but agreed the food is great. i go there almost everytime im in the area for the gun club.
Ahhh love em! My old job used to order really awful pizza for events and at one point switched to Falafel St J and I don't think I'd ever been happier about a free meal. I don't think I've had a single bad thing from them
Yes best falafel hands down! 
There's also another one that's really good too called Falafel Yoni
Was painting in Lachine and my friend has celiac disease and when we got there he listened and heard her issues and got out a better bread from us with flour imported from Israel. He spoke to me and my friends with so much kindness and passion. I wish it was closer cause that was one of the greatest meals I‚Äôve ever had.
Chaque vendredi je manges un pita a la place a Lachine. Cest mon resto pr√©f√©rer √† Montreal. Un s√©rieux 10/10. J'esp√®re juste qu'ils vont pas exploser en popularit√© et descendre en qualit√©...
Thanks for the recc, absolutely going to give it a try!
[deleted]
I was super sceptical, but I tried the shish taouk plate and was floored!  I went in prepared to hate it. Love the salad selections also.
Avec tous les choix de salades quand tu prends l'assiette
Their potato latkas and challah bread are fucking magic.
Their falafel are very good indeed.
Their Sabich rivals the best Sabich in Israel, and I tasted Israel's best Sabich (Obed's) 1 month ago!
Best falafel in the city, potentially ever. They‚Äôre salads rival those that my Israeli parents make and that‚Äôs saying something. 
Pro tip: get it a little spicy, and it is WAY better in house than delivered.
They should move to Sherbrooke O..
saved, thx
Best falafel in the city hands down.  My only knock on them is that their portion is too large.  I cut em in half now.
To be fair, nothing in ville st pierre gets any love.
They're actually on my to-eat list but the one closest to me is in the garment district so I have to really go out of my way.
How do they compare to Sumac? So far Sumac is pretty easily my favourite falafel in the city. And their salads are all incredible too.
Everyone I know who's been there has loved it. I'm not usually big on vegan food either.
Can't recommend them enough! I live at least 30 mins away from their store, and I go there from time to time to grab their falafel sandwich which imo is the best in town.
it's very good, but I've had quite a few ants appear in one of their cake so I'm somewhat abiguous about it...
Thanks for this. I feel nostalgic as hell right now. Love that place
I really like FSJ. But this reminds me of home:
Falafel Damas
https://maps.app.goo.gl/3sugJCTj8Pn9psGU6
100% agree. It's the best falafel in the city. Always stop when i'm nearby
ou sur st-jacques?
Having been to Israel a few times I can say not only is that place authentic but its hella good by Israeli standards
I love FSJ but the last couple times I went they had changed their amazing potato wedges to what seemed like out of the bag fries.. which made me pretty sad. 
Anyone know if that was a permanent change?
Weren‚Äôt they supposed to open a location on decarie? What happened to that? 
Also Sumac is amazing. Better than yoni. But fsj is best.
Its my special lunch treat when I want something that isn't from home. This is coming from someone who tends to err on the carnivore side. Looks like I'm getting a spicy falafel sammy on my way home tonight ü§§
It's been on my list of places to try for a couple months now. Just need to find a time when both my gf and I are in the mood for it.
That salad menu looks amazing. Thanks for the tip.
Delicious. I always go for the plate with salads, sooo good!!!!!
The best. I moved to Ottawa, and dream of this place every night. Strong recommend.
A bunch of people at my work rave about this place, it really is great
Is it kosher?
Gros fan, dommage que je vais rarement dans ce coin l√†..
This place is awesome! I came across i a few years ago. I go so often that the staff recognizes me and i dont even have to place an order since ive always ordered the same thing for the last 2 years. Love it
I love it... Except they recently made a change to their babaganoush and now it's garbage. Instead of smoky eggplant and think it's a bucket of mayonnaise with a little blended eggplant thrown in.
looks like i need to try this. love falafel
I understand this comment probably won't land well, but why is this even posted here? It's... not a good picture. The subject matter isn't particularly unique or interesting. Am I missing something? This user has posted nice pictures in the past, so I'm not hating or anything.

Est-ce que quelqu'un est all√© au march√© Atwater r√©cemment? La derni√®re fois que j'y suis all√©e (il y a environ un mois) absolument aucun de commer√ßants du rez-de-chauss√©e ne portaient de masques, malgr√© que leurs kiosques soient √† l'int√©rieur √† ce temps de l'ann√©e.

Think big . Plein de gens pas de masques . Vive le Quebec. Belle d√©monstration de l'intelligence Quebecoise
Not a cellphone in sight, just people living in the mome... oh.
I was going to post that I quite like the picture because it is not a typical perspective that people share of a skyline etc and feels a little closer to a snippet of some form of daily life. Montreal has lost a lot of typically cool things like a world economy and particularly safe yet sinister night life since a few "brilliant" people had stupid ideas in the mid 70's but this type of taking 10 minutes to hang and have a coffee at a older market is something that a lot of North American cities have had to strive for in the past 20 years or is very hard to explain.
Well to be fair what I get from this picture is that the subject is not one thing in particular, but more the city itself, its soul. The decorations, the road sign, the people that live there, the cabs, the architecture, the dirty snow mounds. It captures so very well the spirit of Montreal by the end of winter.
Because op wants to shame people who are not wearing masks
Je me posais lam√™me question. La composition est pas bonne et le focus est pas bon non plus. √áa ressemble √† quelqu'un qui vient d'acheter une 70 mm 1.8 ou une 85 mm 1.2 et qui ne la ma√Ætrise pas.

I appreciate your perspective! That's the beauty of art, right? You make a good point, culturally: it's easy to forget that very few North American cities have this type of vibe and pace due to a lack of walkability and neighbourhood-centric gathering areas.
Okay, cool, and some other people agree. I didn't comment to win hearts and minds, just sharing a thought.
Ben, les gens dans le photo q'OP partage nous montre la majorit√© sans masque lol
T'as bien raison, inventons des scenarios aussi rocambolesques qu'improbables pour eviter de reconnaitre qu'une grande partie de la population se crisse completement des mesures sanitaires because ... c'est meme pas clair pourquoi.
Une connaissance a recemment poste sur FB qu'il s'etait fait regarder croche quand il a enleve son masque dans le metro. C'est comme ... "well duh".
Ca merite d'etre souligne. Tant que la situation n'est pas revenue a la normale, le monde qui refusent de faire un effort minime doivent etre called out.
M√™me si c'est le cas pourquoi sont-ils exempt√©s des directives de sant√© publique qui s'appliquent √† tout le monde ? Le port d'un masque dans les espaces publiques prot√®ge ceux qui ne sont pas dans la bulle...
ILS SONT DEHORS

√ätre dehors √† moin de 2m avec des inconnus dans un march√© publique, c'est pas vraiment le meilleur endroit pour ne pas porter son masque √† mon avis. Si c'etait dans la cour de quelqu'un avec un seul autre cercle familial tout en respectant une distance de 2m; ce serait bien correcte, mais pas dans un march√© publique.
clairement ce que nous faisons n'est pas suffisant car cela fait un an et ca n'a pas tellement bien all√©e. Mais je suis juste un professionnel de la sant√©, what do I know
ya good point, people die all the time so lets just have more people die.
bravo t'est fucking smart
On ne sait pas √† quels distances ils sont, la photo a √©t√© prise avec un t√©l√©objectif dont une des principales caract√©ristiques est de compresser les distances, √ßa fait appara√Ætre les gens bien plus proches sur la photo qu'ils ne le sont en vrai.
> √ätre dehors √† moin de 2m avec des inconnus dans un march√© publique
that's a pretty wild conclusion from such a photo 
strange that last year during spring/summer the parcs were absolutely filled to the brim with people chilling without masks, and the cases didn't go up until school opened and temperatures dipped in fall
Si c'est pas *essentiel* c'est pas necessaire et ca augmente le risque de transmission. We need to reduce cases more than anyone needs to shop and go to crowded places..
Y a une mamie avec son masque sur la photo. Les deux autres couples ont l'air de pas se conna√Ætre et d'√™tre loin de chaque table, chaque personne se tient raisonnablement √† distance.
You can always call 911 and let them know right away it's a non-emergency but you don't know how to contact anyone else.
They can redirect you easily if necessary.
Realistically though it would qualify as suspicious behaviour/ public safety concern.
Kudos for looking out.
Be sure to talk to the police and let them know the time and such. They can go over the video footage (in the metro/ station) if ever needed or start a dossier. This may not be the first time and might be good to have possible video footage to source an image of the guy.
I live right across from the senior's home on the street. In past years there has been a definite uptick in this type of behaviour - my wife walks this route daily and I worry if it's after dark. You did the right thing here - I only wish everyone had your instincts to help others!
If the police has a twitter or facebook I would also try there because it also makes the public aware. 
**IMPORTANT: thank you so much!!!** If I were that woman I would be incredibly grateful.
Always trust your instincts.
On Lucien Allier I was followed while walking my dog about 2 months ago by some douche guy wearing a beaver tail hat. I asked him to stop following me and he said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt we know each other‚Äù (tip- all creeps will say they followed you cause they knew you/ you asked them to). I went the other direction from my house thinking I‚Äôd circle back and saw him hide in an alley presumably to wait for me to walk back towards him.
I went up to a young guy I saw on the street who was just out for a walk smoking a joint and asked him if he wouldn‚Äôt mind escorting me home cause a creeper was following me. He obliged and was so freaked out as the guy basically jumped out at us when we passed the alley he was hiding in. The guy walking me home still only barely deterred him and he continued to follow us a bit.  Usually I‚Äôd call the cops but at the time my priority was just to get home.
Anyways - always trust your instinct. Lots of creepers out there. But also lots of nice kind strangers who are available to help you out in situations like this so don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help- or like the person in this story - jump in as needed.

In the future if you are worried for safety should just call 911.
You can call 911 for any suspicious activity or even minor infraction! 911 is NOT only for emergencies in Montreal! Reasons I have called 911 include:
- construction starting before 7 AM
- noise complaint on neighbor
- people illegally parked in the d√©barcad√®re of my garderie
They always tell me I did the right thing and they are responsive. In all 3 cases they solved the issue. The construction workers didn't start before 7 anymore, my neighbor finally turned down his music at midnight, and people stopped filling up the d√©barcad√®re.
This situation is much more serious than any of those! Next time call 911!
We are not in the US where 911 is filled with gun violence. They aren't busy and have the time. Take advantage!
Thank you so much for doing something. I have had so many bad encounters on public transit and due to my PTSD, my response is to completely freeze up (something that I really hate about myself). The number of times bystanders just watch something happen without intervening is a lot. The only time someone did something was when a drunk guy grabbed both of my hands on the bus and put his face right into mine- it was a teenage girl who told the guy to leave me alone, even though I was surrounded by men. Thank you.
For future reference, you can call 911 if you suspect a crime is in progress or someone is fleeing the scene of a crime. 
I would considered letting the woman know in case they were being specifically targeted (not sure if they‚Äôre staff at the seniors residence). Could also inform the facility and neighbouring businesses/residents so they can be warned. Not sure whether a local media outlet might take on this story as a brief reminder of caution.
I called 911 for similar situation in the past, the always took my call and sent someone in a acceptable time (less than 10 minutes).
Do not hesitate to call them, worst case they will redirect you.
I am so glad the woman being followed was safe but I am DELIGHTED that people like you are aware of threats and helping. I hope my children will be helpful, vigilant, neighbours people like you. Thank you!
By non emergency line do you mean the local police station? And they didn't answer? Maybe try calling them again to report the incident. Or info-crime Montr√©al perhaps?
Fuck the SPVM. Thank you for making this post.
This past weekend I went for a walk and ended crossing paths with a young woman going for a light jog. We ended up going down the same path with me initially about 15-20m behind her. I walk quite fast normally and as we began walking down the same path (think foot path with forestry on both sides) was able to more or less "keep up" with her, easily I could have caught up to her in a sprint. She gave me a glance and I instantly felt weird. Granted I had headphones on and it was broad daylight but not wanting to freak her out I slowed my pace down so she could put more distance.
first, good on you for taking care of a fellow citizen - there's a good chance you helped to prevent something really bad from happening.
so i'm no expert (i'm also a male - so hopefully i'm not writing this off too easily because of privilege), but to me it seems like this is a bit of a tricky situation. 
Is there evidence that there was "harrassment"? Do you have a video/photo or a description of the dude? Without these two elements, i'm not sure much more can be done. Maybe you can reach out to the STM here: https://www.stm.info/en/info/customer-service/contact-us - maybe they have the policies and steps to follow for such incidents - and if this is a recurring incident, they might escalate.
Time to hit the gym! Buy a nice bright and heavy flashlight to blind a possible attacker! /s
Let's take a minute and thank this amazing lady, she risk her life and tried to protect another women from a stalker without them knowing or noticing her.
Next time just call 911 and explain the situation, they take this calls seriously.
Be careful and thank you again.
That's really messed up. 
Only a few days ago I saw a man following a woman in Girouard Park (very close to villa), and a couple of men intervened. The guy walked away and it was okay in the end, but I'm wondering if it could be the same guy as you?
This guy was wearing really baggy clothing, a hoodie that was hiding his face, and he was white. He walked really slowly too. Sounds familiar?
911 doesn‚Äôt help hasn‚Äôt help won‚Äôt intervene‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like a placebo effect!!
u/lucky_veg Thank You for looking out for others ‚ù§Ô∏è You might have saved a life.  I wish we had more people who would be proactive on these types of suspicious behaviors
You can try going to the Montreal Police Subway Unit at 888, boul. de Maisonneuve EstMontr√©al or calling them at 514-280-9111 [https://spvm.qc.ca/en/PDQ50](https://spvm.qc.ca/en/PDQ50)
You should have videotaped this as discreetly as possible. I know it‚Äôs hard though but our cameras are so ubiquitous these days. Everything about this is extremely suspicious and this guy following her is definitely a sex offender of some kind. You should also report it to the police and maybe they can get images from the metro for future reference.
This guy will try this again for sure.
Damn this is ridiculous how one of the biggest cities in Canada and THE most populated city in Quebec, with active police patrolling- has more of these events happening. Kudos to you for being aware and looking out for the other lady. Hopefully she‚Äôs doing ok as well!
Did you take photos of the guy?
Thank you for looking out for that woman and quite possibly avoiding a horrible crime. Please don't be disappointed with the response you got from the police/STM. I understand that it can be discouraging to see some people not care but you must not let it affect your concern for other people.
I don't have any suggestions, sorry. Just wanted you appreciate you for your vigilance and seeing it through. I hope you report the guy to authorities and they follow through with it.
Damn I‚Äôm scared of going back to school with all these stories being frequent.
So my mom went to work yesterday (may 20) night (around 10:45pm -11pm) . From snowdon metro to edouard-montpetit metro, she got a feeling that some man was watching her. She took notice but didn‚Äôt do anything because she was not sure. She went outside the metro and the man was still following her so she went on a sprint to her workplace, looking back at the man once or twice to see if the man was still following her. She arrived safely at her workplace and the man vanished but she mentioned that this same man was following her for the second time (2 days in a row). 
I mentioned this post to her before she remembered and told me what happened yesterday. So, thank you very much! We‚Äôre planning on what to do if this happened for the third time. 
Should she call/FaceTime me or call 911 first?
eeeeewwww! thanks for the description, I was going to ask. There was a weirdo around here and a big guy, but he was black or biracial. 
Creepy, this guy followed her right to the door.
My experience with the police in Montreal is that they wait for the public transit footage to automatically delete itself and then claim there is nothing they can do.
Not sure if anyone suggested but someone could talk to the senior‚Äôs residence and tell them what happened, have them warn all the residents living there...
Thank you for doing this!
Why did you have to describe me lol good thing I don‚Äôt live near there haha
classic montreal story. So basically nothing happened, the end, next.
>You can always call 911 and let them know right away it's a non-emergency but you don't know how to contact anyone else.
You are right. I should have done that after getting confirmation that this guy was up to no good.
>Kudos for looking out.
Decades of dealing with creepos have sharpened my spidey senses. If it was my little sister, I would want someone to do what I did, and hopefully do an even better job.
I am going to try to contact the police again now.
Thank you for your reply!
Wouldn't 311 be the better number?
EDIT : 311 is the non emergency line not 811, 811 is for health.
Moved into the same building a year ago and I'm always worried for my GF as well. The other day I was at the d√©panneur close to the Jean Coutu on Ct-Saint Luc, and a man came in desperately claiming that people were following him trying to hurt him.
This corner is definitely creepy.
Rue de L'orphelinat is so dark and uninhabited at night, with no cars coming through. Your wife might be better off walking the uglier but with more traffic east side of D√©carie from the metro.
SVPM do have a twitter account where they post notification all the time, but I don't know if they reply back.. STM on the other hand do reply back on twitter, sometimes in like 3 to 4 hours
Similar story from the guys perspective, was coming home on the metro and saw 4-5 guys harassing and cat calling a young woman walking out of Snowden. She came up to me and my roomate and greeted us like she knew us (to anyone watching from a distance) while explaining the situation. We walked out together and the guys stopped immediately.
I just wanted to say I read this, and I'm sorry this happened to you. I hope you have a good support system or are able to find one. Take care of yourself.
a lot of cops are rapists, they protect their own
You can interfere with the interaction. Act like you know the person, ask who they are walking with. Walk near them and drop something then ask for help. Anything like this will break up the interaction (applies to harassement, petty theft, hate crime, etc.)
>There's nothing you can really do at this point.
I am going to try and make some kind of a report with both the STM and the SPVM. I don't know if anything will come of it but I think it is worth a shot.
I definitely should have called 911 after realising I was right about the malicious intent of the guy. Hindsight!
Thanks for answering.
Aha I see! Very good to know, thank you.
I am going to swallow my nervousness and call 911 now, since the other options have not worked out.
edit: yeah that went about as well as I expected sadly, see my edit 3.
>By non emergency line do you mean the local police station? And they didn't answer?
Both actually. The non-emergency recording told me to call the local station, which I did, but they are only available during business hours. 
I then called the non-emergency line back and tried to speak to someone and was not able to even though I dialed 0. 
Not very useful for sketchy stuff happening after 5pm.
Thanks for the suggestions, I'm going to call the local station now that it is daylight again and maybe call info-crime too.
I'm a woman. 
I honestly don't know how this would play out but I'd like to think that a quick "sorry, just going the same way, let me get ahead of you if you'd like" might...or should?...work?
I would want it to work!
I fully understand her concern, because even if *you* aren't a risk, she doesn't know that, but I also understand your discomfort and you're not doing anything wrong. 
Perhaps consider it, I guess saying something like that won't make the situation *worse*? 
It's not easy for anyone.
This is a good point to consider, from a legal context. But as person who used to work with offenders, I'll tell you why you should still call the police.
If the cops show up due to a report of a man following a woman off the metro, down several specific turns on the street, onto the property of a private building, they will probably show up. The guy has not committed a crime yet, but given there's a witness reporting all this, they will almost certainly question the guy and ask what he's doing there. If they find grounds to identify him (this is the important part) and he is already and offender with a record or someone with release conditions or probation conditions, this might very well be a violation of those conditions, or cause to notify his probation officer, etc. Who knows, maybe the guy has a weapon on him that they find.
If he has no record and no weapons, he hasn't committed a crime at this point and they probably can't do anything, *except you stopped this incident*, AND sent this guy a message.
>first, good on you for taking care of a fellow citizen - there's a good chance you helped to prevent something really bad from happening.
I would not have been able to sleep at night had I not followed my gut.
It was a really tricky situation, especially since up to the point where it was clear he was not actually going somewhere but just following her, I could have been completely wrong.
I have a description, and I have the exact time that we all got off the metro. I am going to call the STM and see what comes out of that.
Thanks for your answer!
It's not your job to judge, it's the literal job of a judge. 
You don't call the police because you KNOW something is bad, you call the police so that they can INVESTIGATE if something is bad.
We shouldn't call the police because we KNOW our neighbors are BAD and we want them ARRESTED. We should call the police because there is a conflict between you and your neighbor and the "police" should help investigate who is right or not. 
The fact that society still think and act like it should be the former is a massive problem on every front: with the way police act in itself [as if they're judge, jury and exec], with the way we regulate them [as a "force" rather than an "intelligence"], with the way people react when police is introduced into a problem [like your neighbor being mad you called the cops on them], the way people hesitate to ask them for help [like in this case], etc. 
We need to change that mentality.
No joke I was in the metro thinking what in my bag I could use as a weapon. Settled on an unopened coke can in the fist. 
Cannot WAIT to start working out in the gym again.
Not sure why the sarcasm tag, flashlight is better than nothing since we can‚Äôt carry mace or pepper spray. There are some very compact but extremely bright flashlights on Amazon that any woman could easily carry in a purse, and would absolutely blind and disorient someone at night. That buys you time, or in desperation can be used as a blunt object to defend yourself.
Main thing is, if there‚Äôs no one around, take the AirPods out, look over your shoulder, and just be aware. If it seems someone is following you then find someone, detour you a street with more people on it, go into a dep, trust your instincts.. make three left turns, if that person is still behind you call 911. Worst case it‚Äôs nothing, best case you saved yourself from getting raped or murdered. 
But I see a lot of oblivious women out at night, buried in their phones. I‚Äôm a male, I was mugged at knife point once and I‚Äôll never be oblivious again

Fabulous resource for the holidays and just generally to help support our local community. Thank you kindly!
In normal times my favourite place to find local artisans and gifts for Christmas was the * SOUK @ SAT. This year they are online, but they feature so many great local designers that you'd be amiss to not browse their website. 
I can strongly recommend coffee from *CAFE PISTA they've got two store fronts -one in Rosemont, the other in downtown. 
For home goods, my favourite shop is *V DE V located in the Plateau. 
For eco responsible womenswear, take a look a *LOUVE DESIGN. The materials are made from recycled fabrics however there is no storefront, but the clothing fits to size.

C'est fair. Tant qu'√† moi, la couleur du ciel et de l'eau, avec l'ensemble de la ville, c'est "pamal" ce qui m'a fait arr√™ter pour prendre la photo. La vraie vue est √©videmment plus belle.

OP recr√©e par le moyen d‚Äôillustrations des pavillons qui ont exist√© lors de l‚ÄôExpo universelle Terre des Hommes tenu √† Montr√©al en 1967. Je sais pas si c‚Äôest √ßa que tu voulais savoir...
C‚Äôest possible qu‚Äôil n‚Äôaime pas que op ait fait des erreurs. Si c‚Äôest le cas, grow up bro.
Oh look, hundreds of people who are going to have their next social gathering indoors to avoid being fined. We could've taken advantage of the nice weather that incentivizes people to socialize outside where the risk is very low. Instead, we mandated masks outside and lined every park with police officers, forcing people to take their socializing inside where they won't be caught even though the risk of spreading covid is much higher
I wish the government would put this kind of effort into installing proper ventilation in schools and enforcing sanitary measures in workplaces.
Ah. Ca explique pourquoi j'entendais du monde crier et chanter des trucs comme "si tu aimes la dictature, tappe des mains" dans ma rue vers 21h.
Le couvre feu aurait du se terminer la 2ieme semaine de Mars. Le gouvernement ne respecte pas la gravit√© d'un couvre feu. 
Plus ca dure, plus nous allons souffrir des √©meutes √©vitable.
Je ne suis pas un covidiot, mais je ne crois pas que le couvre feu est pr√©sentement justifier. Avant Mars je trouvais que le gouvernement se d√©brouillais malgr√© les circonstances. 
Apr√®s avoir √©t√© affaiblit par des d√©c√©nies de neoliberalism, ce n'est pas surprenant de voir qu'il n'√©tait pas pr√©parer pour r√©pondre a une crise de cette √©chelle. 
Mais de prendre la mesure d'un couvre feu a la l√©g√®re ? C'est inacceptable.
Et moi je veux savoir, comment le gouvernement compte aid√© les sans abris pendant cette crise. Il on remit ca sous le tapis mais je me souviens au d√©but du couvre feu c'est devenu d'actualit√©.
The two people playing badminton by the soothing flicker of red and blue!
I was there today but left at 7:30. I could not believe how many people were there
At 8:30? On such a gorgeous night? That‚Äôs sadistic.
Montreal is starting to crack lol can't wait for the riots I need a new tv
Euh... c‚Äôest pas 9:30 le couvre-feu???
Not only out of touch but just as anti-science as the most fervent anti-masker. Outdoor transmission is [not a concern](https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/223/4/550/6009483) and the data has been clear on that all year. Kicking everyone outside for the night would be more logical than this lunacy
Edit: "Not a concern" wasn't meant to imply outdoor transmission is impossible, but that it's a [low-risk activity](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/risk-of-covid-19-transmission-outdoors-explained-1.5981935) that is far preferable to indoor gatherings.

Wait, are they really clearing the place? It sounds more like they are harassing with the 2 meters distance.
‚ÄèApparently, Francois Legault has received a letter from the Corona Virus Union informing him that the Corona Viruses had changed their work schedule in Montreal and Laval from 9:30 p.m to 8 p.m. That‚Äôs why he has changed the curfew hours.
This virus may go away, but hate for police will not
Fuck the curfew. They got what they deserve. 4 of my friends got 1500$ tickets for being in a park (at like 5pm). The parc was full
Fuck, filmer cette sc√®ne en drone aurait √©t√© superbe
Damn straight , maybe this mess will FINALLY end .

Pourtant la distanciation sociale etait bien respect√©e! Car ce matin, au parc Lafontaine, il y avait des d√©tritus tous les 2 m√®tres dans tous le parc, y compris tout le long de l'√©tang. Et dans l'√©tang avec le vent.
Aucune sympathie pour ces groupes, ce sont visiblement une bonne majorit√© de gros porcs.
Are we all banging pots and pans at 8 tonight to protest the curfew or what?
Laurier Park was worse at 8pm. It was impossible to walk through it without bumping into people.
A majority of people have been following the rules. The issue are the minority who pass disinformation and create conspiracy theories that have no facts. 
That been said, the constant rule changes are not helping. 
People are wearing masks but the washing of hands and sneezing into sleeves is no longer being followed.
Outside isn't a vector for disease spread. Grow up, M. Legault.
Tabarnak.
The only curfew I could agree to is limiting groups of 10 after 10 PM. Simple, one number to work with, and that‚Äôs about all you need.

Some SPVM are such losers. Wonder how they find such angry, grumpy, ragers

>‚ÄúThere will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed. But always‚Äî do not forget this, Winston‚Äî always there will be the intoxication of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face‚Äî forever. ‚Äù
Imagine committing the crime of being in a parc at 8:30pm smh
Are the bathrooms
Open at parc Lafontaine?
Question: why the downvotes? I was genuinely curious
Why do they use that ridiculous English accent on their announcements? 
Montr√©al is becoming a police state. There are much better ways to handle this pandemic than letting cops power trip as they enforce a maligned curfew.  
If you don‚Äôt mind the curfew, ask yourself, do you have a balcony? Is your apartment nice? Are you a person that stays in after 8pm anyway? If yes, shut the fuck up.
I hate it hereeeeeeee
I drove past Parc Jeanne Mance on friday evening and it looked like the Montreal Jazz Fest. So many god damn people practically shoulder to shoulder, and hardly any masks.
Fucking imbeciles.

Enjoy it while it lasts. The exponential spread of the UK variant and the Brazilian one will make it worse and they don't have much choices too. 
Here's an example why. In the past 4 weeks about 75% of 45 and under deaths to covid happened in BC and are linked to the Brazilian variant. That's 75 percent of deaths in the younger brackets in the past 4 weeks. 
It is slowly getting worse and there ain't much none of us can do about it.

Orwellian.
If this continues 
They restrictions will  be change to 6pm LOL 
Then we really f**k

This does not make me want to go near Montreal, why can't these people behave themselves? I hope this isn't representative of the population.
This sub is turning anti mask. I‚Äôm out, enjoy your mediocre echo chamber.
Boot them out at 9:25. The whole thing is preposterous anyways but fuck if you have to boot people out boot them out at 9:25. It‚Äôs fucked in the head.
This sub is becoming anti mask, I‚Äôm out. Have your retarded echo chamber.
They should slack the outside rules if they don‚Äôt want their rules to be ridiculous... and yes, people to cheat inside their houses
To add to your comment, I went grocery shopping yesterday at my local IGA. I had no choice, it was the nearest one to my home and curfew was right around the corner. The store was full of people. I don‚Äôt know why the government isn‚Äôt making an effort to reduce how crowded indoor spaces can become. I felt very uncomfortable but that‚Äôs what the government wants. ü§°ü§°ü§° 
I miss being able to shop at the late hours, when there was no one around. Made my life less stressful.

Anyway, how's y'all's night going?
Me, I had supper with my buddy downstairs, came back at 10.30, considered taking a walk downtown before midnight, but said fuck it and instead jumped in my pajamas, cracked a beer open and watched the Bye-Bye with the cat curled up on my lap. Cosy, but i miss going to the old port to watch the fireworks and have a couple of drinks and stopping at Foufs for a beer on the way back.
I hope the *actual* 2022 New Year's Eve will be less dull.
Bonne ann√©e √† toi et ton beau chat!!

Its all good man haha. Happy new year!
Je respecte √ßa!
It's because I'm feeling victimized by March which is super privileged with its 307 days and counting and I'm still trying to insert the term "patriarchy" somewhere in there but i don't know where. Plus spring begins in March and symbolized by the colour green which is like, super offensive to colour blind people.
Whoa, whoa, slow down, I'm not ready to need a walker to get around yet!
That said, happy 2033 to you!!
Thanks and same to you!
En plus √ßa aura occasionn√© plusieurs commentaires comiques alors √ßa me d√©range pas de passer pour une √©cervel√©e pendant 24h!
Actually I was mocking people who see cancel culture everywhere (who usually are big fat hypocrites because they usually have no problems boycotting the things *they* don't like)
Man, y‚Äôall talking about 2033. I just miss 2002 ;-;
I don't have a problem with people boycotting whatever they want. It's their prerogative. There are a ton of companies that i boycott myself. My problem with cancel culture is that boycotting doesn't go far enough for them. If there's something they don't like, they want it gone altogether.
And it doesn't stop at companies either, it also affects people. There are definitely some assholes put there that deserve to be "cancelled" (pieces of shit like Harvey Weinstein come to mind) but there's an awful lot of babies getting thrown out with the bathwater with that movement. For every Weinstein that gets cancelled, there are casualties like an Al Franken who i really don't think deserved the treatment he got. I can see some positive aspects to cancel culture, but in general, i find it tends to get too extreme, and i really hate the censorship aspect associated with it as well as several other elements.
Someone recently posted the link to a documentary about the crazy shit that went down at Evergreen College in Washington, and it's pretty frightening.
I agree that it often gets out of hand, but let's be honest : while the term is mostly used by the right to describe the left variant of the phenomenon, the right themselves have often been quite eager to go to the exact same lengths to rid themselves of what they disliked, and for longer than the left (see: moral panics over comics in the 50s, Dungeons & Dragons in the 80s, Harry Potter in the 2000s). It's just that they usually suck at it (the comics one was pretty successful, killing adult/mature subjects in American comics for decades and ensuring superheroes had no meaningful competition for a long time, leading to the modern Marvel and DC universes; the others, not so much) since they tend to go after stuff that's protected by free speech laws and society evolved since the 50s.
I think there's hypocrisy on both sides of the political fence. I'm a lefty btw, but i don't associate with the wokeness movement, just like i didn't associate with the form of extreme feminism that developed with the Me too movement (a good thing in itself until a bunch of extremists took it and ran with it) despite being a feminist myself.
I just think that extremes in general, no matter whether they come from the right or the left are bad news.
Lock your doors, fam.
I watched as two guys tried jimmying the lock of my neighbors apartment in broad daylight last week. What was kind of funny, was that the tenant had moved out the day before, and the new tenant hadn't moved in yet, so it was an empty apartment. They didn't get in.
I called the police, and amazingly they were arrested in like 45 seconds. I have never seen such a fast response from the police in my life. I was still giving the dispatcher a description as I watched the police arrest them.
..lock your doors
Yup,   
On a shared terrasse, I keep my terrasse doors open in the summer as there are no possibilities of people coming in except for neighbors (shared terrasse)  
My neighbor had a couchsurfing guest, dude came in late at night, drunk/drugged in the proper apartment, went out for a smoke on the terrasse and decided to crash on my couch instead.  
I was kind of surprised in the morning as I went to the bathroom naked (lol); got dressed, tried to wake the guy,  
I called the police; they woke the guy and escorted the still drunk/drugged guy out.   
I never got an apology from either the couchsurfing guy or my neighbor.
Lol. Reminds me of this serial killer guy in the U.S. (of course, I forget his name) who said that unlocked doors was an invitation.
Sorry I really had to pee
I met someone that had left the outside door to their plex unlocked one night. The next morning they found a random woman passed out in the stairwell that goes up to the apartments on 2nd floor. So yeah, lock your doors! All of them!
Depends where you are. Downtown is tough. A friend had a ground floor apartment, more than once did people walk in through his patio door.
Get auto-locking locks.
In the building I used to live in downtown, it was not at all uncommon to have them break in to the lobby and garage (more like probably just walking in through the garage) and just start doing lines of coke, smoking meth, pissing in the corner, sleeping in the stairs (hard to be mad at someone who just wants a nap though, but seriously dude you‚Äôre snoring really loudly and how the fuck did you even walk up 10 floors in your condition?), drinking 40‚Äôs, etc.
Not the same situation as this but it‚Äôs just to say - these guys are quite bold.
what neighborhood are you in?
At Urgences-Sant√©, we have recently been briefed to start locking our ambulances at all times. A homeless person was found living inside one of the ambulances at the eastern base of Montreal.
This has been happening for a while. When I was a kid in Outremont (in the 80's), my parents didn't always lock the doors. One morning I found a homeless person on the floor of our kitchen. I went and woke up my dad. He gently shook the (still drunk) guy awake and escorted him out. I don't remember what time of year it was but I am guessing he was just looking for a warm place to crash at.
I have a hilariously funny and scary story about a time when I was living with like 6 roommates as a student and we seldom locked the doors. One day I wake up to a strange lady in my room entrance. She rambled about being "Junior's Mom" and being there for some obscure "reason"... We had a friend called Junior but I woke up my roommate and we figured it was definitely not his Mom. When we came out of my roommate's room to kick the person out, we couldn't find her... Turns out she was hiding behind a door in another room. We kicked her out, went back to bed, we still didn't lock the doors. When we woke up we found muddy foot steps all over the apartment and the fridge door open. She had come back in and stole some beer and cheese from our fridge. 
Apparently that apartment was a "maison de chambres" we had a lot of strange encounters and people knocking on our door randomly looking for "someone".
√Ä 5:30 du matin en d√©cembre pass√©, j'ai entendu quelq'un entrer √† la course dans l'immeuble, a tent√© d'entrer dans tous les appartements du rez-de-chauss√©e, avant de repartir √† la course aussi vite qu'il √©tait entr√©, j'ai pas eu le temps d'aller voir √† travers l'oeil magique √† temps.
Depuis je m'assure toujours fe bien fermer la porte d'entr√©e quand mes voisins ne le font pas.
A guy slept on my lawn yesterday in ahuntsic
I had a man wander into my place middle of the night last year, ran away when he heard me still awake. I had called the cops and apparently he had been going into people's homes all night looking for booze... Luckily for me he only got into my empties
I've found a homeless man going threw my kitchen fridge one night in Halifax. My housemate had no pitty and went to school on them. I felt so bad.
I live in triplex where there's an inside staircase. One day I went to a neighbor house late at night and forgot to lock the main door of the building on my way out. Turns out that a homeless guy walked in, got to the second floor and laid down in front of the two apartment doors. One of the two tenants up there was a lady in her 40s. She told me she opened the door and screamed so loud seeing that guy that he got up and ran down the stairs.
The weird thing is that it's a street filled with attached houses, so this means this man was probably trying every door until one could open. Very strange...
Yup, definitely lock those doors. Same goes for almost any city I'd say. A friend in montreal had all his shit stolen after a roommate forgot to lock during the day.
Dude, the Purolator delivery guy has opened my door _multiple times_ when I don't get to the door immediately after he knocks. I can't figure out what the deal is.
Summer. And pandemic. Suspect this will happen quite a bit. Sorry you had the experience.
Over the past 10+ years, I've had 2.5 breakins.... first when I did not realize they could jump a 12 ft fence, second when I accidentally left the patio door closed but unlocked.
What I was told when I moved in: don't fear violence, but expect anything not locked to be taken (bikes) and anything left unlocked, good chance it will be tested/ opened. Once I really figured this out, no real issues.
Exactly the same date, like 10 yrs apart. (July 14.) Weird, right? One overnight, the other late afternoon. Once I was home, the other I wasn't but neighbour was. When I was home, sleeping, only grabbed things immediately on dining table where patio door was (laptop, camera, etc). Probably saw me working there late. Lost great pics of that weekend and recent stuff, but it was a pretty new laptop so not that much. But. Kinda crazy. Weirdly, I was not that upset bc it confirmed what I had been told (theft, not violence.) Having lived somewhere where this is the trend, I more fear violence here so I was glad to have the warning prove through, if that makes sense.
The second time, neighbour was upstairs, but luckily I had my laptop with me. Took some camera gear but little else, luckily. Still a big claim but hey, updated my gear. Little loss given I learned last time, everything is cloud and hard drive backed up.
The 0.5 time, pulled more open a large window at front where my desk was, leaned in and grabbed a laptop bag. Laptop wasn't in it, but wallet was. Spent like $40 on 2 credit cards, didn't touch the one with a crazy limit, dumped the rest, someone left my driver's license on my front steps a day or two later. Was a good bag and wallet tho lol.
I think I moved in where a drug dealer used to live..
Three times : a random dude just came in, checked around, looked confused and left. (After asking a couple of times where XX was hiding)
Door was unlocked; it was around 8-9 pm and I was watching tv.  They stopped coming when one time they woke the pittie and he was grumpy..
Similar thing happened to me an early morning in Hochelaga. I heard the cat running up the indoor stairs (I live on a third floor) which is usually a sign of someone entering.   
I went to the stairs and their was this guy filling his crack pipe at the bottom of the floor. I told him to "Get the fuck out of my house!" and the cunt had the nerve to tell me "Chilllllll man".   
So yeah, locking the door at all times now and installed a little camera looking at the front door.
Nothing a baseball bat won‚Äôt fix.
It happened two times that we had a knock on our door at no hours in the middle of the night.
Both times it was from an incapacitated homeless who was ordering us to open the door. We called the ambulance/police both times.
We live close to a metro station but far from downtown. It was quite unusual.
Not me, but I guy I dated once. He was living in Ottawa at the time (not in a great neighbourhood), woke up in the middle of the night and there was a rubby in his bedroom. Meanwhile, he's in bed, naked. I'd have been kind of freaked, but he said "Dude, get outa here, you can't be doing this!" Rubby just turned around and left...I guess Rubby was just drunk and not dangerous but still, yeech.
Yup.  I just moved into a place in Homa, that was a trap house before being renovated.  This dude has walked in three times.  I really should learn to lock my door.  But it‚Äôs just not natural to me if I‚Äôm home.  Anyways, he‚Äôs actually not a bad dude.  Super confused.  The last time he no shirt no shoes and got kind of comfortable on my patio set after I got him out of my apt.  I had the bad judgement of calling police.  I ended taking his side, asking them to leave and had a chat with him.  I gave him a pair of pumas ai hardly wore a t-shirt.  He was super happy, and excited and it made my day.  Police treated him like a alley cat, and me like a naive idiot for helping him.
yes i once watched a guy try to open my front door - he gave up and left but still!
Toujours barrer sa porte en ville. J‚Äôai appris √ßa dans les ann√©es soixante quand une voisine s‚Äôest fait voler son portefeuille sur la table de cuisine.
Once I was drunk and passed out in my apartment with the keys in the front door.   
Lucky to live in a cool building, but I got robbed just two weeks ago..so just lucky I guess.  
Lock yer door mate, there are fkn crazies out there.
You're actually the 4th person I've heard this happen to, 3 of my friends have dealt with this. Either homeless or weird drunkard. Never forget to lock your doors again!
TIL people in homa and the village don't lock their doors.
Welcome to the city, lock your doors. Homeless people are in need of shelter and this city does a dogshit job at providing that (squats get blocked off and boarded up all the time). Homeless people aren't that scary, and locking your doors is a good habit anyway.
I‚Äôve been at my workplace on weekends and I‚Äôve seen homeless and transients going around the building pulling on every door to see if any would open. During the daytime/broad daylight.
My upstairs neighbor walked into my place the other year when he got off on the wrong floor. My wife beat the poor guy over the head with a hardcover book, they are good friends now, but we put auto locks on the door.
Well this is terrifying, time to finally get that security system installed!
Lcok the door next time bro
Luckily i live on a 3rd floor, but my neighborhood is sketch af. Do you live on the 1st floor w ur entrance to a busy street?
Just lock your door?
Do you mean they were in your apartment proper, or in the entryway/vestibule? There are a couple of homeless guys who regularly sleep in my building‚Äôs entry (like, inside the first set of doors but not the second) and nobody is too fussed about it. They don‚Äôt bother anyone and usually leave as soon as people start using those doors to come and go for the day.
Very familiar story.  Same happened to me few years back .... It was -37 outside . I gave him clean outfit got him to take a shower . Gave him a place to sleep . Ended up I broke my neck shortly after and he was a life saver for me. helped me with all the things I couldn't do around the house . I got surgery and I'm doing very well.  I helped him start his own business doing land scraping and snow removal . He is now doing very well and my surgery worked and I am able to walk upright. Can't do much else but  He still comes and helps me with Yard work and snow removal no charge . We are very good friends to this day . Remember folks . Do only good everyday (dogecoin)
my friend woke up and found a homeless man sleeping in his hallway. He locks his doors now
That‚Äôs what happens when you live in a big city. There are people that wander around and just try to open doors to see if they can get in. You need to start locking your doors. You were lucky it was a someone you could just yell at this time. Another time they could be armed and dangerous.
Start locking your windows too. Its great you have a dog!
I had my downstairs neighbor walk into my apartment once, but he just got mixed up about what floor he was on.
As for homeless people, never had any try to get into my apartment but have had one sleeping in our stairwell and one who would hang around (don't know if he slept there) in our laundry room during the early days of covid lockdown.
Honestly the very first night my boyfriend & I moved into our new place, I forgot to lock the front door‚Ä¶ 
I left a very large bag of weed near the front window on a table, to be fair, I‚Äôm on the second floor of a duplex so you‚Äôd have to walk up the stairs to see in my window.
When I woke up, it was gone & it‚Äôs been almost 2 months it‚Äôs been missing, I tore apart the house & put it back together, no where to be found.. I was talking to my mom & she said I definitely got robbed, they took the easiest thing to get away with with the largest value.
Lesson learnt.  Lock your doors!!
If he was intoxicated he might have legitmately entered the wrong house.
There was a homeless person who slept on the back porch of my neighbor's house a few months back. I think he tried to sleep on my porch but my dog is a barker so he probably moved on to their porch instead.
He caused no trouble and moved on after that. I've seen him around the area but he hasn't been back to our block since. 
Times are rough for a lot of people - the pandemic has hit some people pretty hard and housing prices continue to go up regardless and shelters are having a hard time keeping up. I expect this sort of thing to become more and more common.
It's not a great solution, by a long shot, but definitely contacting your local shelter to see what you can do to help might go a long way.
if you didnt have dog im afraid he would have climb in bed with you.
does Canada recognize *Castle Doctrine*?
Had a group of 5 or 6 break into the hallway  entrance of my building during winter. 
Didnt have the heart to kick them out to the cold.

C'est la premi√®re fois en pr√®s de 8 ans de vie en appartement que j'ai un proprio qui ne m'augmente pas. Bref, oui il y a des bons proprios c'est vrai, mais pour mon exp√©rience positive, j'ai 20-30 exp√©riences n√©gatives de gens autour de moi. Ma proprio est malheureusement l'exception qui confirme la r√®gle.
Garder les prix artificiellement bas, √ßa cr√©e un d√©s√©quilibre ailleurs. Et √ßa pousse des proprios qui autrement seraient raisonnables √† chercher des trucs l√©gaux pour faire des r√©novictions, ou autre. (Voir le groupe FB "Mordus de l'immobilier"... "Y a-tu quelqu'un qui conna√Æt un bon notaire pour m'aider √† booster mes loyers?")
Depuis 2000, √† Montr√©al, l'immobilier a fait +300%, alors que les loyers, c'est +80%. Il va y avoir un rattrapage. Mais plus les locataires vont utiliser des "tactiques contre la gentrification", plus les proprios vont se tourner vers des "tactiques d'optimisation de portefeuille."
C'est poche, mais on est dans un monde capitaliste et on continue d'√©lire des gouvernements capitalistes. Tant que √ßa changera pas, les riches vont avoir le privil√®ge d'habiter les meilleurs quartiers, et les pauvres vont ramasser ce qui reste.
4. Utilisez votre pouvoir de citoyen qui est de voter. Votez pour un parti qui est conscient de la crise de logement et de la gentrification.
5. Encouragez les petits commerces locaux et ceux qui sont l√† depuis des ann√©es.
Edit: erreur de grammaire.
C'est le genre de trucs et astuces qui d√©courage n'importe quelle personne qui est bien intentionn√© de devenir propri√©taire dans le locatif √ßa laisse que les trou de cul et les le monde qui vont traiter √ßa comme une business pour acheter des immeubles √† logement et perp√©tuer le cycle.
Moi je pense qu'il faut √™tre compl√®tement malade pour vouloir dealer avec des locataires pour √† peine couvrir son hypoth√®que.
Ces mesures propos√©es n'augmentent en rien l'offre sur le march√©. Au fait, il ne fait que la diminuer.
Ces "solutions" ne font rien pour am√©liorer le sort des locataires de la ville.
C'est completement contre-productif de faire circuler ces genres "d'astuces" sous le pr√©texte que √ßa va am√©liorer les choses.
Yes do #3 whenever you move into a new place. The previous tenant may have been living there for years and had a very sweet rent!! The law is clear: even with new tenants rent increases shouldn't be more than the law allows so exercise that right!
Tu sais que les augmentations autoris√©es par le TAL pr√©voient que le proprio r√©cup√®re son investissement en pr√®s de 40 ans?
En vous fiant uniquement √† l'outil du TAL, vous encouragez le proprio √† en faire le moins possible, c'est aussi simple que √ßa. Vous contribuez directement au mauvais entretien du parc locatif montr√©alais. Si vous avez une bonne relation avec votre proprio, je vous encourage fortement √† n√©gocier de bonne foi des hausses raisonnables.
Aussi, l'id√©e comme quoi on ne devrait jamais payer plus que le prix du locataire pr√©c√©dent est compl√®tement absurde. Aucun m√©canisme de retour aux valeurs du march√© est pr√©vu √† la loi alors √ßa donne des situations malsaines comme des gens sans enfants qui paient 650$ pour un 6 et demi dans un quartier central. Qui profite de √ßa, exactement?
Le proprio pr√©c√©dent avait fini de payer son hypoth√®que et n'a jamais augment√© par n√©gligence. Le nouveau proprio, m√™me s'il a n√©goci√© serr√© son prix/hypoth√®que est coinc√© avec √ßa pour toujours. Quand le ma√ßon va arriver pour r√©parer sa fa√ßade, il lui accordera pas de rabais parce que M. Gendron paie 650$ au lieu de 1400$. Si l'ann√©e d'apr√®s M. Gendron conteste son augmentation, le TAL va donner au proprio un bon 4% d'augmentation. 300$/ann√©e dans les poches du proprio pour des travaux dans les cinq chiffres.
Faque M. Gendron va d√©m√©nager, il va c√©der son bail et le proprio va √™tre coinc√© avec Johannie, une bourgeoise fut√©e plus riche que lui qui passe son temps sur les groupes fb de swap.
Assez ironique ce genre de tactiques abusives de locataires pour √©tirer l'esprit de la loi √† son maximum quand c'est exactement ce qu'on reproche aux proprios. Je vous rappelle que les √©victions pour r√©nos majeures (lorsque agrandissement, subdivision, etc) sont tout √† fait l√©gales. De m√™me que les reprises.
&#x200B;
Bref, connaissez vos droits mais essayez donc d'√™tre raisonnables. Collectivement, on a aucun int√©r√™t √† appliquer ces "petits trucs" de mani√®re syst√©matique. Sinon, t'es pas un justicier, t'es juste un trou de cul comme Shiller Lavy et autres crapules.
Pour le #3 ca va juste faire en sorte que les proprios vont laisser l'appart vide pendant un an.
J‚Äôai vu un garage list√© 600$ a hochelag, j‚Äôy ecris par ann√©e?, il me repond non par mois...
belle recette pour qu'il y ai au mieux, encore plus de  "reno viction"  ou au pire un parc immobilier en d√©cr√©pitude...   
Une solution serait que le gouvernement offre des subventions au loy√© aux familles a faible revenu. Comme √ßa la gestions des immeubles reste au priv√©e.
Capitalism is not perfect, but it is better than the alternative. 
The reason people in Montreal need cheap rent is because of Quebec's existing legislation that undermines free market activity - which has led to decreased opportunities and decreased wages. 
If you think that the solution to this problem is to further manipulate more parts of the economy, I think that is a failure to understand what is actually happening. 
The argument that these evil landlords are taking "more than their fair share" assumes that there is a fixed amount of money in the world. That is not the case. Where is your personal responsibility? Don't you want to live in a prosperous city? 
Where are the people fighting for more opportunities to make more money? Listening to so many people in this thread asking for the government to exert more influence over the market is so inherently pessimistic. It is a real bummer.
Rien de ca va faire en sorte qu'il y aie plus de logement ou moins de gens. C'est une une haine mal plac√©e des proprios.
Edit: aussi Alternative Socialiste, s√©rieusement? Un des autres offshoot du parti communiste Qu√©b√©cois. Parce que le monde √©tait tellement bien log√© en URSS /s.
I totally understand the tenants in this situation, but damn I feel like the landlord don't get heard either.
Yes there is abuse from both tenants and landlords. We saw some documentaries a year or so about a lady who totalled an apartment and made over 100,000$ of damages. Who pays for that? The landlord. The landlord gets shafted every time. It takes 6 months to kick out a non paying tenant. The landlord has payments and a family to feed too.
There is also landlords abusing their powers too, I understand that some just add a coat of paint, and then increase rent by a lot.
Then again, landlords OWN the building. When you rent it's not yours. You are borrowing. It's sad to see landlords lose rights over their own purchase.
We also don't talk about how Montreal has been increasing their taxes exponentially which landlords pawn the increases off to the tenants. When the landlord owns a 4 Plex evaluated at a million a year, the landlord pays big taxes also. Montreal needs to reevaluate their taxes for buildings.
Un gros probl√®me de s'adresser au TAL en ce moment, c'est que m√™me si le locataire est 100% dans ces droits, √ßa lui cr√©e un dossier que les futurs propri√©taires peuvent consulter. Et dans le march√© actuel, les proprios font largement de la discrimination sur le sujet, souvent au grand jour. En tant que locataire, c'est un pensez-y bien : vais-je bruler ma candidature future? 
Je ne dis pas que c'est correct, bien au contraire, le syst√®me est cass√©.
Et pour la session de bail : je connais plusieurs histoires de proprios qui refusent les cessions de bail, for√ßant le locataire √† mentir sur le loyer pour le gonfler artificiellement. Ces proprios ne respectent pas la loi, et si un locataire va au TAL, alors il aura le probl√®me mentionn√© pr√©c√©demment...

Moi, je suis pour la gentrification. Je veux que Montr√©al soit riche et affluente. Personne ne s'attends √† avoir des logements abordables √† Manhattan, je ne voit pas pourquoi on se bats pour √ßa √† Montr√©al.
Merci de partager!
De vraies solutions:
- √âliminer le contr√¥le des loyers
- √âliminer les r√®glements de zonages qui limitent la densit√©
- Emp√™cher le gouvernement d'imprimer de l'argent √† ne plus finir
Pour le point 3, si j'avais su. Mon loyer de mon appartement pr√©c√©dent aurait √©t√© 100$ moins cher.
I‚Äôm being renovicted right now actually. Roommates don‚Äôt seem to give a shit either. It really sucks. She‚Äôs paying us 5000$ each to leave in the next two months once our lease ends.
>  Ce qui arrive apr√®s, c'est que le TAL fixe le loyer selon les d√©penses et revenus de l'immeuble et les pourcentages applicables d'augmentations. Cette ann√©e, les pourcentages sont exceptionnellement bas ‚Äì certains sont m√™me dans le n√©gatif. Et en plus, sur la majorit√© de l'√Æle, les taux de taxes municipales et scolaires ont baiss√©s (ce qui influence √©galement le montant de hausse "l√©gale"). C'est donc tout √† fait possible que vous ayez le droit √† une r√©duction de loyer.
Sure, but the city makes it egregiously difficult to find this information in the first place. I remember in 2018 spending a week looking up municipal plans and tax info and desperately hoping I had filled otu the RDL form correctly. Is there a centralized/simpler way of finding this information? I live in Outremont, by the way.
While he was changing my decrepit water pipes, the plumber that services my building (25 units) said "yeah, don't bother accepting the rent increase, they'll never show up to court anyway" ('they' being Akelius LTD). Buuuut, on the other hand, you can always hear the sounds of workers on other floors. Were those people renovicted, or did they move out of their own volition? It's a lot to gamble on.
trouvez-vous un Frank Gallagher
if a landlord is already doing all these fraudulent things, I would not even trust having my stuff in their apartment to begin with and if you challenge the landlord, they're not going to want you as a tenant and will make your life miserable until you leave.
no thank you
25$ de plus par ann√©e depuis 2019 est-ce de la gentrification dans Outremont-Mile-End ? Je paye maintenant 925 pour un grand 2 1/2 tout-inclu (√©lectro et eau chaude).
Super strat√©gies dans une situation ou les augmentations vont plus vite que l'inflation. Heille le monde d√©m√©nage et les proprios haussent les prix de 15-20% √Ä M√äME L'ANNONCE √Ä LOUER. Esti du me gniaise? Genre le monde demande si l'appart est toujours dispo et se font r√©pondre que le prix √† augmenter parce qu'il y a trop de demande. 
De penser que les pauvres proprios sont en train de s'appauvrir c'est d'√™tre des anti-masques du loyer!
4. When you buy a building, don't be a dick
Fantastic advice! I‚Äôm real proud of you for posting this and hopefully it helps some people with the ridiculous rent situations we are all now facing. 
We should be protesting and marching against all these insane rental prices. The way people gather for ‚Äòliberty‚Äô protests because they don‚Äôt want curfews and masks, they should channel that energy into protesting the rental increases. 
Force the government to step in and do something. Like they‚Äôre doing in New Zealand. Affordable housing should be a right, not a privilege. For ALL!
Buy a house
Peut etre si le monde continuait daller au dep pi aux dive bars de quartier au lieu du petit caf√© et dla microbrasserie...
Je viens d'emm√©nager dans un appartement sur le Plateau cet automne, avec un loyer tr√®s respectable pour le secteur √† 800$ pour un 3 et demi. Les proprios m'avaient avertis que le loyer augmenterait parce qu'ils devaient refaire la brique, travaux qu'ils ont faits, d'ailleurs. L'augmentation pour juillet prochain √©tait finalement de 8$ par mois, donc 1%. Honn√™tement, c'√©tait rafra√Æchissant de se faire avertir √† l'avance pour 1% d'augmentation √† cause de travaux majeurs.
Vous trouvez o√π ces merveilles, svp? Je ne sais m√™me plus o√π chercher...
Il ya 10 ans nous avons vendu et trouver un beau logement, bas de duplex immense et prix raisonnable. Propri√©taire fantastique mais un peu trop pr√©sent. Nous avons fait UN downgrade √©conomique car j'avais perdu mon job et j'ai trouv√© le 7 1/2 que nous avons en ce moment. Prix fantastique, aucune augmentation en 5 ans,  et propri√©taire excellent. 2 en 2 pour moi. Les deux places j'ai trouv√© en marchant dans le quartier et en jasant au monde.
il y a √† peu pr√®s un an j'ai eu une occasion comme √ßa, mais je ne l'ai pas pris. je regrette tlm :( il y avait meme une laveuse secheuse priv√©e
Pourrais-tu s'il-te-pla√Æt me DM les coordonn√©es de ta proprio si elle a d'autres logements √† louer?
Je dois bient√¥t aller √† Montr√©al pour mes √©tudes et j'aimerais savoir o√π chercher pour trouver les logements les plus abordables (m√™me si √ßa reste cher).
Je connais Kijiji mais si quelqu'un a d'autres tips, je suis preneur!
"cool story", mais c'est quoi le rapport?
Au risque de me faire downvoter, des proprios comme √ßa, qui louent tr√®s en de√ß√† du march√© et qui n‚Äôaugmentent pas, ils font partie du probl√®me, pas de la solution. En n‚Äôaugmentant pas, ils se privent d‚Äôun revenu (leur choix), mais privent aussi d‚Äôun revenu le futur propri√©taire (pas son choix) puisqu‚Äôune augmentation normale d‚Äôune ann√©e ne peut pas se reprendre. A terme, on a donc des logements qui n√©cessitent de plus en plus d‚Äôentretien (souvent au niveau de la structure, m√™me si tout est clean √† l‚Äôint√©rieur) et quand c‚Äôest le temps de payer 80k$ pour refaire la brique, ils partent avec le pactole (le prix de l‚Äôimmeuble est pas fix√© par le TAL, lui) et le futur proprio, qui n‚Äôest tr√®s probablement pas un sp√©culateur, mais un petit couple ben ordinaire, est pris avec un loyer trop bas par rapport au prix de l‚Äôimmeuble. R√©sultat : une forte pression √† trouver des fa√ßons de mettre le locataire dehors et d‚Äôaugmenter le loyer √† un prix qui colle avec le prix de l‚Äôimmeuble et l‚Äôentretien. 
D√©sol√©, mais la crise du logement est pas due aux m√©chants sp√©culateurs qui jouent au Monopoly avec les logements du pauvre monde : elle est due √† un probl√®me structurel de politiques publiques qui engendre une offre limit√©e de logement et, dans une moindre mesure, une demande accrue.
Quelles sont les solutions envisageables (concr√®tes) selon toi?
Tout √† fait,
Je suis de l'avis que MTL est ~~la grande ville la moins ch√®re~~ une des grandes villes moins ch√®res au Canada (~~probablement l'Am√©rique du Nord~~) gr√¢ce √† nos lois au Qu√©bec, mais maintenant la demande est juste trop forte et on a retour du balancier.
EDIT : Pas raison pour l'am√©rique du nord
> Garder les prix artificiellement bas, √ßa cr√©e un d√©s√©quilibre ailleurs.
Bingo, quelqu'un qui comprend l'√©conomie sur ce sub. San Francisco est une des villes les plus r√©glement√©e au niveau zonage et loyers aux √âtats-Unis et c'est √©galement la plus ch√®re √† vivre. Il faut permettre aux gens de b√¢tir comme ils veulent pour accommoder la demande et de laisser les prix aller pour √©viter les effets pervers (comme les locataires qui gardent des vieux bails pas cher m√™me quand ils d√©m√©nagent ailleurs ou les r√©novictions).
> Depuis 2000, √† Montr√©al, l'immobilier a fait +300%, alors que les loyers, c'est +80%.
En d'autres mots, ce ne sont pas les loyers qui sont artificiellement bas, c'est l'immobilier qui est artificiellement √©lev√© √† cause de la sp√©culation.
C'est tellement poche pour les locataires. Pourquoi monter le loyer de 25% entre deux baux quand tes paiements hypoth√®quaires n'ont pas augment√© depuis 15 ans? De l'avarice pure et simple en but de se payer un McChalet dans les Laurentides.
On a un devoir citoyen de contester ainsi que d'informer les nouveaux locataires de toutes augmentations si on veut pas finir comme Toronto.
Le croisement exponentiel dans le march√© immobilier est insoutenable, sauf si l'argent perd sa valeur.
So, c'est encore la faute des pauvres. Les proprios font vraiment piti√©s hein...
Et tu crois que les politiciens vivaient dans les m√™mes quartiers que le peuple dans les pays communistes?
Solution: soyez riche. Ce qui n'est pas si difficile.
Quel parti est conscient de la crise? C'est de loin le probl√®me (municipal) qui m'affecte le plus, je vais donner mon vote √† n'importe qui qui am√®ne une solution viable.
1. √áa va rien changer.
2. √áa va rien changer.
Si tu penses que voter est un pouvoir de citoyen, tu es soit cave ou na√Øf.
Il n'y a aucune crise du logement √† Montr√©al. C'est juste que les plus pauvres se font d√©placer plus loin, ce qui est normal.
haleine de cuir
Le but c'est pas de payer l'hypoth√®que non plus, c'est un investissement safe √† long terme qui va se rembourser et te profiter apr√®s 20-30 ans... Si tu veux un retour instantan√© tu peux aller sur la bourse et autres alternatives.
And Osheaga is like ["hey where should we hold the festivals now?"](https://www.lapresse.ca/arts/spectacles/2021-04-15/nouveau-plan-d-amenagement-du-parc-jean-drapeau/l-avenir-d-osheaga-en-peril-a-montreal.php)
Le charme du parc Jean Drapeau √©tait justement qu'il y avait beaucoup d'arbres pour faire de l'ombre et ou aller chiller pendant les festivals.
Je veux pas √™tre buzzkill mais on parle de l'√Æle sainte H√©l√®ne, une √Æle artificielle entre la rive sud et Montr√©al. R√©ellement, ces millieu humide sont insignificatif car ils n'habite aucune population significative d'esp√®ces autres que les √©cureuils et les raton laveur... Les milieux humides que l'on devrait prot√©g√© sont ceux qui sont intact, qui habite plein d'esp√®ces et qui sont pas dans le milieu d'une m√©tropole...
The space is beautiful, but they never should have been permitted to destroy that much nature so that a music festival can maximize profits.
Evenko was in Coderre's pockets (or his ego).
Thankfully the island is being upgraded so that they can replace a lot of the parking lots with more green space
Lorsqu‚Äôil n‚Äôy a pas une foule pr√©sente, c‚Äôest vraiment inconfortable et d√©sagr√©able d‚Äôy marcher dessus. Cette superficie immense est beaucoup trop blanche et refl√®te trop le soleil. M√™me pas des √Ælots verts pour r√©duire l‚Äô√©clat.
S√©rieux groupe CH/Evenko peut aller se faire voir
J'esp√®re que ces photos comparatives circuleront largement pendant la campagne √©lectorale √† Mtl. Coderre tente de se pr√©senter comme un born-again environnementaliste, pro-transport en commun, logements sociaux, alors que tout ce qui lui importe est son prestige personnel et l'√©paisseur de son porte-monnaie. Ne soyons pas dupes.
I hate what they've done. Went to osheaga and ile soniq at the newly renovated areas and it feels completely different. The main stage has zero trees, and no grass, just astro turf. It used to feel like walking through a forest at a lot of places and now it just feels like a corporation took over and razed the area to get as many vendors/km¬≤ as possible
Bin c'est √ßa, Denis Coderre. On coupe pis on met du ciment.
Les fournisseurs de ciment sont tr√®s bons dans les enveloppes brunes...
Unpopular opinion : J'ai vraiment aim√© la nouvelle configuration quand j'ai √©t√© √† Heavy MTL. La plupart ou l'enti√®ret√© de la zone est artificielle right et n'a pas d'animaux right ? J'esp√®re que la perte de ces arbres sera compens√©e par de nouveaux dans d'autres zones.
Whoa c'est vraiment laid vu d'en haut..
I mean...I guess?
I've heard good and bad things about the new venue, but as a part of a reworking of the island it seems like a good thing overall. 
Replace some of the parking lots and roads with trees, and cut down some trees to improve the festival experience. I don't see why it has to be one or the other. The end result should be more trees overall and a nice new place to go to some festivals.
We should be overhauling the island to work better for Montrealers generally. This all seems like part of that.
AJA que c‚Äô√©tait pour les festivals. Je trouvais √ßa weird me promener en v√©lo sur des grands espaces vide comme √ßa haha
All thanks to Coderre never forget that.
Thanks, Coderre.
Source? Aussi, il aurait fallu diff√©rencier les milieux humides de la superficie bois√©, m√™me s'ils sont parfois les m√™me.
Vu du haut on dirait qu'un avion pourrait y atterrir, comme √† l'[a√©roport Billy Bishop](https://www.google.com/maps/@43.6281539,-79.3977339,1930m/data=!3m1!1e3) au centre-ville de Toronto
Its much much better than it used to be. This white unistone paving will help to keep the area cool in the summer, much more so than the giant parking lot with dark gravel. There is a ton of mature growth on this island alone, its nice to have one area with a pavilion.
Comparez √ßa avec Hyde Park √† London qui a la m√™me capacit√© (65k) mais presque pas de ciment.

C‚Äôest une catastrophe sign√©e Denis Coderre.
Projet Montr√©al est pas parfait mais PLEASE √©vitons de r√©√©lire Mr. Powertrip McEgo!
No one ever considers that in 2021, building _nothing_ is far more of an impressive accomplishment than building anything.
Are the people complaining that some trees got cut down also people who complain about St-Lambert residents whining about noise?  I‚Äôm all for the preservation of as much woodland as possible but this island is negligible in its environmental value and in a city of 4 million+ that hosts world class events sometimes this is going to happen.  Say what you want about the city vs Groupe CH but these are good events for the city despite some disappointment that this space isn‚Äôt very useful outside of those major events. We can make up for it by replacing some of the parking lots with green space and upgrading the remaining green space.
NON C'EST LES VOITURES LE PROBL√àME
This is pure political play. CH Group bashes Plante, Coderre is reelected and make it rain for them.
Je me demande si ils pourraient simplement rallonger la dur√©e du festival pour compenser pour les artistes qui peuvent pas jouer sur les sc√®nes manquantes.
J'ai vraiment aim√© la derni√®re fois o√π je suis all√© au Heavy Mtl. L'ann√©e avant la fin des travaux. Il y avait des sc√®nes entour√©es d'arbres. M√™me une dans la for√™t. Il y avait des food-trucks et des tables √† l'ombre o√π on pouvait relaxer. Maintenant c'est juste un grand espace ouvert en b√©ton pour faire rentrer le plus de monde possible.

√âDITH : pr√©cisions
Je suis en d√©saccord. M√™me s'ils n'ont pas la m√™me la m√™me valeur √©cologique que les milieux humides de la coul√©e Grou, par exemple, ils ont tout de m√™me une bonne valeur, surtour pour des milieux artificiels. 
Les marais et l'ancienne tourbi√®re ont une importance √©cologique assez remarquable et les travaux de restauration et de cr√©ation de milieux humides annonc√©s hier sont une excellente initative, qui aura des effets positifs √† la fois sur la faune et la flore et sur les utilisateurs du parc.
Tser les insectes √ßa existe et √ßa fait parti de la biodiversit√©...
De plus, as-tu des rapports et des donn√©es qui prouvent que des amphibiens ou tout autre esp√®ce connexe aux milieu humides n'ont pas √©t√© introduit l√†-bas depuis le temps ?
L'ile sainte helene est naturelle... C'est l'ile notre dame qui est artificielle.

Coderre is in Evenko‚Äôs pockets (Molsons).
Je serais curieux de connaitre la superficie des stationnements qui vont √™tre remplac√©s vs ce qu'ils ont d√©truit pour construire leur horreur de b√©ton g√©ant.
Enti√®rement d'accord. J'y suis all√© une couple de fois, ca ne m'a pas donn√© l'envie de chiller. Je dirais m√™me que ca m'a fait fuir.
Les rares fois o√π je suis all√©e aux √Æles en m√©tro, la seconde o√π je sors de la station, je d√©guerpis imm√©diatement de cette plaza d√©nu√©e de verdure. Quitte √† sonner comme une vieille chieuse nostalgique, c'√©tait mieux avant. √Ä la limite, d√©gager l'extr√©mit√© de l'√Æle qui donne sur le centre-ville (l√† o√π le Calder se trouve), √ßa va, mais √©tait-ce vraiment n√©cessaire de raser toute la v√©g√©tation pr√®s de la Biosph√®re?
Moi non plus j'aime vraiment pas ce grand espace vide et la p√¢leur du sol me tue les yeux quand il fait gros soleil.
Pourquoi vous promenez-vous dans l'amphith√©√¢tre alors?
En supposant que vous y soyez en m√©tro, √† la seconde o√π vous sortez du m√©tro, vous allez dans n'importe quelle direction autre que nord / ouest, vous √™tes litt√©ralement dans des sentiers √† travers la for√™t et pourriez facilement passer des heures √† marcher autour de l'√Æle sans jamais avoir √† toucher le nouveau d√©velopp√© surface.
Je fais du v√©lo tout le temps autour de Drapeau et de Notre-Dame, et cr√©er un espace permanent pour les festivals et les √©v√©nements est bien meilleur que la fosse de boue d'herbe morte et de salet√© qu'il √©tait autrefois.
Je vais quand m√™me pas voter Plante donc en esp√©rant plus de deux choix
Well, that is exactly what happened.
I hate it too. The uniqueness of the place has been lost forever. Coderre literally stole this experience from us.
And from the ground.
Leave the roads.  They provide some sweet cycling.

"Oui mais si je suis √©lu, je vous montre √†  quel point je suis riche!"
Ces dents, piti√©! Je ne vois que √ßa! Idem sur des photos de campagne j'ai l'impression de voir jim Carrey dans the mask
J'ha√Øs tellement √ßa quand les gens me parlent de l'argent qu'ils font. Je me r√©tracte toujours sur moi-m√™me.
Pis √ßa, c'est exactement la raison pour laquelle j'ha√Øs √ßa. Y'a rien de noble √† √™tre plein de cash. C'est souvent fait de fa√ßon louche. T'es pas meilleur pcq t'a plein d'argent, en fait, y'a des bonnes chances que tu sois crott√© ou que tu fasses qqch de crott√©.
J'ai un ami qui me parlait des profits qu'il faisait avec la cryptomonnaie pis criss que √ßa me d√©prime que d'encourager une affaire full pas √©colo de m√™me soit payant.
Pis si on parle des salaires, c'est souvent compl√®tement al√©atoire. Je me tuais corps et √¢me quand j'enseignais pour aider des immigrants √† apprendre le fran√ßais et √† √™tre √† l'aise ici. Il y en avait qui restaient apr√®s le cours et qui pleuraient en me racontant leur vie. C'√©tait un emploi que je consid√©rais comme important (mais j'ai l√¢ch√© pcq j'√©tais toujours en burn out oups).

This guy better not win.
For all of Plante's flaws, at least she has a clear plan and actually wants to make Montreal somewhere people want to live in and choose to stay in. Coderre wants to make the city cater to people who commute in for work and leave right after. Guess that shows his supporters do not live in the central boroughs and how out of touch he is with the city he was once mayor of.
He's also mega corrupt and a pathological liar.
C'est correct si il aimes les gars, faut pas juger.
C'est un bon boulechiteur, faut lui donner √ßa.
Le smog de Montr√©al affecte la m√©moire pis le cerveau, √ßa a l'air.

Dommage, c‚Äôest bien rigoler sur les enjeux qui nous concerne
One my my favorite things about this city are the amazing murals. You don‚Äôt really see them be this good and have this many of them anywhere else.
Here's her Instagram.
https://instagram.com/danae_brisso
I love all the artwork around the city and especially discovering murals I‚Äôve never seen before. 
I hate the fucksticks that ruin said beautiful murals with their shitty ass tags.
Can I hire Artists like this for my building?
Do I need a permit?
Looks like a lot of Jason Botkin influence in there too
Merci pour la belle photo!
Loving these abstract visuals
I was walking past this 2 days ago and saw the artist touching up some parts. Stood and watched, she was brilliant. Told her so too.
I saw them painting yesterday
It‚Äôs increasingly popular in other cities. Montreal is pretty special though.
I used to travel specifically for murals and street art before all the cities did mural/wall festivals, and Montreal is definitely top 5 for me.
[deleted]
Yessss Quebec artists!!!! Wish they chose someone with less clout so we can get the young vandals off the streets and doing murals but I love it locals only!!!
tags are the story of a city you don‚Äôt understand these kids will do graffiti they‚Äôre whole lives and never get paid a cent for it a lot of them will get fines or arrested but they do it cause they love the art form but it‚Äôs okay if you don‚Äôt understand or hate it even cause you we‚Äôre never meant to understand
Yes and yes.
http://www1.ville.montreal.qc.ca/banque311/content/demande-d%E2%80%99autorisation-pour-la-cr%C3%A9ation-d%E2%80%99une-murale
Wynwood est d√ªr √† battre, mais ce n'est qu'un quartier de Miami, excentr√© et mal desservi par le transport en commun. Montr√©al a des murales dans tous les quartiers, en quantit√©. Il y a celles des rues, mais aussi plus de 300 dans les ruelles vertes. L'an dernier seulement, il s'est peint plus d'une centaine de murales √† Montr√©al, malgr√© la pand√©mie! J'estime en avoir photographi√© plus de 900, c'est une immense collection, offertes √† tous, dans tous les quartiers et accessible. Sans parler du plus vieux festival de street art d'Am√©rique, UnderPressure, qui oeuvre depuis plus de 25 ans. Donc oui, Miami compte plus de vedettes muralistes sur ses murs, mais sur d'autres crit√®res, Montr√©al n'a rien √† lui envier.
That‚Äôs fine and tags have their place and will never go away. But why ruin someone else‚Äôs hard work and efforts? What does that do for anyone?
Also, happy cake day :)
A tag is no an art form.
It's a shitty signature on a wall.
It's even worse when done on an *actual* piece of art.
Thank you!!
Ta photo eat vieille ou le parc a son propre micro climat?
I love that place so much. I remember one year, someone threw a life-sized great white shark statue into the water.
 I hope they get the fountain working again next year!
I miss this place... and La Banquise..
I used to walk past this scene daily for school.  Thank you for stirring up a great memory.
A squirrel once ate a peanut from my mouth there. Heaven 10/10.
Lovely.
Amazing! LC would be proud.
Splendide
I took this pic on Friday!
>I remember one year, someone threw a life-sized great white shark statue into the water.
Haha c'√©tait moi avec un groupe d'ami! Le requin √©tait sur la fa√ßade du El Zaziummm et les proprios du resto, qui habitaient pr√®s de chez des amis dans le Centre-Sud, l'avaient laiss√© dans la ruelle. On √©tait 3-4 √† l'avoir amen√© jusqu'√† l'√©tang du Parc Lafontaine. √áa doit bien faire 10 ans de √ßa...

Beautiful! You can also see that the vertical lines are not perfectly vertical, except for one or two on the central building!
C'est parce qu'il y a un ciel bleu et un soleil typique des journ√©es froides et qu'on ne voit pas d'eau √† proximit√© de la neige, ce qui nous indique qu'il fait froid.
Today it should have spelt:
'COLD

Enfin lib√©r√© de toutes ces hordes de touristes, trop bien Ulysses r√©gale-toi mon fr√®re
They definitely look healthier too. I remember the cal√®che drivers arguing that the horses would be miserable without dragging tourists around the old port. Seems to me that argument was horse sh*t.
Bon app√©tit Ulysses! ü•ï
[deleted]
Is this at A Horse Tale?
beautiful! Give him a nice apple!
Thank you for caring for this beautiful creature. üíöüå±
Great for them! All animals deserve to live out their lives free from suffering or exploitation. Be vegan.
Free at last, free at last, free at last... Free from the indignity of hauling overweight sweaty tourists around the polluted streets of Old Montreal. Enjoy your golden years, my sweet noble Ulysses.
I am so happy for him and all the other horses that were freed from their living hell. It never seemed right to me. But they are happy! always seemed like a crock of horse S\*\*t to me.
They're not miserable at all! Soft ground to walk on, always in sight of the herd, stalls they can sleep and turn around in. But Percherons don't mind actual work like logging in the mountains, but not really hanging out in the city sucking car exhaust and walking on hot pavement.
I am certain many days were very difficult, making your way with iron horseshoes on the hot, hard pavement, close to the polluting cars.
However.
I‚Äôm sure there was the odd time these guys and gals didn‚Äôt mind a nice easy pull, on a beautiful day in this fair city of ours.
Uly is more about graceful strength than speed. He's a big old lumbering ball of love.
Yes it is.
Totally agree üå±. Vegan btw.
Doesn't justify the idiots who drove them, I live in the area, and have for more than two decades. Those morons went the wrong way down one ways in the old port without a care in the world, the horse in front. They did this despite warnings and close calls, into small streets with blind corners that are parking exits. They turned INTO oncoming traffic with again the horse in front of them, using the horse to stop traffic for left turns where they shouldn't, never thinking for a moment that someone in a car may not be paying attention.
&#x200B;
Granted it may not have been all of the drivers who were reprehensible morons, but in the absence of that industry cleaning up its embarrassing behaviour, in the absence of the "good ones" speaking up about their callous and idiotic colleagues instead of keeping silent, there was no redeemable version of those horses working in the city. None. Not with those brutes at the reins, never mind the absolute idiocy that used to come out of their mouths about the port. I have no fond memories of those times, other than an occasional selfish yearning for the sound of their hooves echoing in the port and through my house, during the summer months. A sound that loses any appreciable tone the minute you catch site of the idiots leaning against their seat irons barely looking forward going the wrong way down a one way ... again. Good riddance to them all, the drivers.
&#x200B;
Dear Ulysses, have a trot for me on that perfectly crisp wintery grass, I hope you've found your horsiness again. ‚ÄúThink you're escaping and run into yourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home.‚Äù  ‚Äï **James Joyce,** Ulysses.
How do you know someone is vegan and from montr√©al? They'll yell you. Vegan btw üëç

Get use to it, we'll keep seeing more and more records until it's too hot for us to survive on this planet.

C'est tr√®s d√©primant quand il fait beau sachant qu'on a encore un couvre-feu avec un gouvernment qui veut √† tout pris le garder le plus longtemps possible.

The future is fucking depressing
You're right, [June-July-August will only see a rise of about 2 degrees](https://i.imgur.com/50zKmX7.png) in comparison with the rolling average of the 80s-2000s, so it's likely that even the warmest day in the season will only be temporarily unlivable during the day but nothing we can't overcome.  
The kicker will just come from the mass death of species, oceans acidity getting fucked and ecosystems in it potentially including any of our food in there, the winter temps delta rising by twice that, changes in currents and consequently air flow over masses of land (good luck to predictors of weather patterns!), climate change refugees in the billions, and the mass flooding of a significant portion of a significant number of major cities on waterfront in the world, along with the ports of major hubs allowing for the transit of goods in the world particularly in Asia (amongst other places).  
But all in all, summer shouldn't really stay above the 45s for too too long to make the areas in Canada uninhabitable or anything, and if anything it's more Southern US (New Orleans and Floria) that has to worry about that specific issue.  
That fate is reserved more seriously for a [certain band of South Asia](https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2833), the Arabian Gulf, and parts of Africa. Which, y'know, only host some billions of people in the world or something.
True, this is a next generation problem. Let them deal with this.
How does something 99% of scientists agree is happening bullshit? "People have moved onto something new" so? It doesnt make it any less real. And who cares what AOC talks about? How dumb are you?
There Definitely was more than a week of hot days last summer ...
It's really not as bad as the media would have you believe. World has more trees than in the past 20 years. These outliers days that beat record is 2-3 days a year out of 365. Yes climate is changing and yes we responsible for making things better for ourselves, but the cataclysmic end of all arable land is overblown.
As the boomer generation die off, it will become massively easier to pass climate-friendly laws.
Wow, calm down. All I said was that he wasnt going to see that in his lifetime.
Not at all what i was saying. But it will take hundreds of years before earth becomes unable to sustain human life even in the worst case scenario
[deleted]
I mean, this thread is from someone who‚Äôs not looking forward to the summer heat. Montr√©al isn‚Äôt really that hot and 32C for idk, 2-3 weeks total is appreciated no? I‚Äôd personally have a few months of that but I think I‚Äôm the odd one out
Yeah except for the whole tipping point that were fast approaching. Climate friendly laws won't do a single thing once the permafrost melts and releases a bunch of methane that's 10x more effective at trapping heat compared to carbon dioxide. We're on a bus fast approaching a cliff. After a certain point, no matter how hard you slam the breaks you're still gonna crash. That's us right now, we have 10 years to slam the breaks. Instead we can't even everybody to wash their hands and wear masks...
> World has more trees than in the past 20 years.
[hm](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/humans-have-destroyed-or-degraded-two-thirds-of-the-world-s-original-tropical-rainforests)
Trees are releasing as much co2 as they capture after just a few years. The problem of oxygen production and co2 capture will come from our oceans where algae responsible for around 75% of our oxygen are dying very fast. Climate change doesn't come from a singular issue, it comes from the combination of multiple ecosystem dying and creating a chain of event rapidly increasing the deterioration of our fragile ecosystem.
Thanks Mr. Plutocorp!
And all I said is that you're correct, is what I said. He'll see refugees in numbers greater than populations of the rich countries, the fall of major parts of the ecosystem, unpredictable weather patterns and storms/tornado/etc patterns, and only unbearable days but not unlivable ones (unless he travels closer to the equator). Which is to say, again, that you're correct :)

I browse reddit too, but my sources are not news channel station that make money off of clickbait articles.
Agreed, once again, I wasn't saying everything's pink. No obviously there's a lot of work ahead. I just don't think having everyone go "We're doomed, fuck it" is better.
I was just trying to be hopeful, say that it's not all doom. Should've written a longer message to clarify, but the downvotes don't hurt, so whatever.
On s'en va √©ventuellement vers un mur avec la mani√®re dont on relache des GES, surtout si le thane contenu dans le permafrost est relach√©
Avec un ventilateur qui pointe sur moi en permanence c'est endurable. C'est mieux que -30.
No, you just link studies for sale where we can't view the conclusion, which I'm sure you paid for
Hope should come from real information. Pretending everything is going to be fine when it won‚Äôt be makes matters worse.
Oui bien sur, mais les probl√®mes vont survenir des inondations, ph√©nom√®nes m√©t√©os extr√™mes, famines, etc et des crises politiques et √©conomiques associ√©es √† ces derniers, pas de la chaleur directement.
I guess it depends how much heat your building or house keeps in. Last year was no fun in my apartment with the heat waves even with 2 fans going 24/7 but you‚Äôre right, at least it‚Äôs survivable.
C'est effectivement un probl√®me, et ce, depuis longtemps. Chaque fois que je descends √† Berri-UQAM ou Jean-Talon √† l'heure de pointe  je dois carr√©ment foncer dans le tas, ou attendre que tout le monde embarque et descendre apr√®s eux. C'est ridicule.
T‚Äôes pas le seul. 
Font √©galement monter ma pression:
- ceux qui se foutent √† gauche dans l‚Äôescalier roulant mais qui jamment l√†. 
- ceux qui doivent ABSOLUMENT se garrocher vers la porte 2 stations avant de d√©barquer meme quand le m√©tro est fucking plein (on le voit plus depuis mars 2019 mais je suis encore marqu√©)
- ceux qui arr√™tent d‚Äôavancer IMM√âDIATEMENT apr√®s √™tre entr√©s dans le wagon. La personne derri√®re toi est suppos√©e te sauter par dessus?
Merci OP pour la vitrine.
C'est le moment que j'appr√©cie le + (Lors des rares fois que je prends le m√©tro)
Sortir des portes en accrochant tr√®s brusquement tout le monde qui se met en plein devant les portes qui ne sont m√™me pas encore ouvertes! Ca fait d√©compresser, tout en sachant que tu n'es pas dans le tort. Jusqu'√† maintenant, personne n'a os√© dire quoi que ce soit, EVER. Et c'est un peu d√©concertant, un peu comme si les gens s'attendent a se faire bousculer, comme si on √©tait dans un m√©tro extra overcrowded de Shinjuku.
Sinon, je reste devant eux en les regardant, jusqu'√† ce qu'ils r√©alisent qu'ils sont un peu idiots et qu'ils se tassent, me laissant la place pour sortir.
[ins√©rer le meme First time? ici]
Mais ouais, en 25 ans d‚Äôutilisation, cela ne s‚Äôam√©liore pas. Et le concept de file d‚Äôattente semble de plus en plus oubli√© √©galement pour les autobus. Et les groupes qui marchent sur les trottoirs 5 personnes de large sans laisser passer les gens. 
Bref, quand je vais dans des villes m√©ga populeuse (New York ‚ô•Ô∏è), les gens ont plus de mani√®res en public. Mais Montr√©al, c‚Äôest juste √©trange. Je me demande comment c‚Äôest √† Toronto.
Je suis tellement d'accord, moi en sortant je fonce et je pousse le monde, j'utilise mon sac √† dos comme bouclier. Mais √©videmment ce n'est pas tout le monde qui peuvent faire √ßa mais √ßa me fait du bien le faire!
Laisser le monde sortir d'un bus, un m√©tro, un ascenceur est comme une r√®gle sacr√©, osti que √ßa m√©coeure c'est qui ne le font pas!
C‚Äôest comme les gens qui marchent sur le trottoir √† deux et ne se tassent pas pour laisser les gens du sens inverse passer. Aucune consid√©ration pour les autres, ils pensent juste √† eux.
Tellement! Les parisiens ont bien des d√©fauts mais ils s'√©cartent des portes du m√©tro pour laisser les gens descendre. (Mais ils se mettent en moton sans faire la file pour monter dans l'autobus...)
Most often people stand in front of the doors, their eyes glued onto their smartphones and just waltz in without looking.
I would support 100% if STM decided to hand out tickets to those zombies.
Ma strat√©gie de pr√©dilection avec ces gens c'est de feinter la confusion. Au moment de sortir, Je me place devant eux comme si par accident je souhaitais pass√© √† gauche lorsqu'ils souhaitent passer √† gauche, puis √† droite lorsqu'ils souhaitent passer √† droite et ainsi de suite √† quelque reprises. Pendant ce temps, d'autres passagers arrivent √† sortir sans heurt. C'est magique!
Merci t√©l√©travail!! 
I FEEL YOUR PAIN!! 
Honn√™tement, c'est la chose #1 que je d√©teste du m√©tro. √áa ou le monde qui attendent pas que tu sorte du wagon pour qu'ils rentrent ou reste clou√©s devant les porte et attendent que tu sorte..... 35 ans de transport en commun et √ßa devient pire. Bonne chance et essayons de rester Zen malgr√© tout.
I just walk through people, if it pushes them it's their fault.
God I wish people had better etiquette too.
Yesterday as I was getting off the bus, an older woman PUSHED ME BACK INTO IT so she could get on. Absolutely absurd.
Si tu laisses sortir les gens, il y aura plus d‚Äôespace dedans.
Malheureusement, les gens qui tu dont parle sont pas capable d‚Äôobserver √ßa.
Bien d'accord, on penserait qu'avec la pand√©mie les gens changeraient un peu cette attitude qui veut absolument avoir une place assise pour deux stations mais non...
mou√© itou, j'veux l'prendre, le metro.
j√© l'doua!
Ah ah. √áa me rappelle un gars, il y a des ann√©es de √ßa, qui descend √† Berri sur l'heure de pointe. Il se pr√©pare d'avance en tenant son sac bien serr√© contre lui et devant lui dans un bras. L'autre bras mis devant lui √† 90 degr√©s, √† la hauteur de ses √©paules, comme s'il tenait un bouclier invisible. Les portes ouvrent et il se pousse un chemin parmi la foul√©e d'imb√©ciles qui ne comprennent pas comment √ßa marche. J'ai bien rit pcq c'√©tait comique et malheureusement necessaire.
Pis mettez du d√©o svp
D'o√π le nom transport *en commun* üòÖ
Pire que √ßa c‚Äôest le monde qui donne pas leur si√®ge √† les a√Æn√©es o√π les femmes enceintes, etc. C‚Äôest la plus pire que j‚Äôai jamais vu dans ma vie.
Imaginez √ßa une dame de 85 ans doivent rester d√©bout parce que la monde a devin√© ignorant. 
Aussi, enl√®ve vos esti sac √† dos!
Avant la pandemie, je lachait un "Laissez sortir svp", et apr√®s 2 secondes, je rentrait dans le tas, *hard*. Je veux dire, sans aucun effort pour √©viter les gens qui me bloque le chemin. Si ils tombent sur le derri√®re c'est leur faute. Ca prend bien un avantage a mon surplus de poid haha!
Oh Mon Dieu! Je suis soulag√©e d'apprendre que je ne suis pas la seule √† avoir ce pet peeve. √Ä chaque fois que √ßa m'arrive, √ßa m'enrage et en ce moment, je n'ai aucune envie qu'on me bouscule pour entrer dans un wagon.
Et les gens qui rentrent en plein milieu de la porte pendant que les passagers sortent! On est sens√©s attendre sur LES C√îT√âS de la porte pour laisser les gens sortir par le milieu, comme les fl√®ches sur le plancher √† Berri-UQAM l'indiquent.
Je suis tann√© de devoir contourner des idiots en sortant du m√©tro et je n'aime pas √™tre trop proche des autres √† cause de la COVID qui existe encore.
devrait avoir des portes pour rentrer, et d'autres pour sortir.
Comme les bus; tu sors a l'arriere.  
oui, ya tjrs 1-2 clowns qui sortent en avant, en heure de pointe.  Le pire cest le cave qui se reveil pis qui tasse tlm pour sortir en avant pendant que le monde monte a bord.
Je suis chanceux d'avoir des heures pas mal flexibles. Je ne voyage pas √† l'heure de pointe. Ce n'est pas plus civilis√©, mais il y a moins de monde, alors la manque de savoir-vivre est plus tol√©rable.
Je ne veux pas vous faire de la peine mais c‚Äô√©tait la m√™me chose dans les ann√©es 80, m√™me pour les morons qui ne bougent pas √† gauche dans les escaliers, seule diff√©rence, il y plus de monde et les heures de pointe durent plus longtemps...
Encore une de ces occasions o√π le cri primal se r√©v√®le √©tonnamment utile‚Ä¶
Depuis qu'ils ont mi les marques pour indiquer la position des portes c'est encore pire qu'avant. 
Moi je fonce au travers sauf si je vois un enfant, personne √¢g√©, femme enceinte, gars de 6'5", etc.
J'ai toujours l'heureux "accident" de jouer du coude en sortant du m√©tro, du haut de mon 5'6" (quand les gens sont dans le chemin). Que jles vois s'essayer de m'bousculer, baswell.
J'ai vu, √† quelques rares reprises, des gens call out ce genre d'attitude-l√†. Du genre "Excusez-moi, il faut me laisser sortir pour que vous ayez de l'espace pour rentrer". Ils ont toujours l'air tellement √©berlu√©s quand √ßa arrive. Messemble que c'est un principe assez simple pourtant..
I don't care anymore.I just push everyone out the way. Move or be pushed.
https://youtube.com/watch?v=aW_sw77sqvE&t=392s
Si √ßa peut te consoler, je suis quand m√™me de grande taille et costeau et maintenant quand ya du monde cave de m√™me je fais juste rentrer dedans. Si yen a un qui me regarde bizarrement, je dis juste tasse toi la prochaine fois.
C'est un probl√®me depuis toujours √† Montr√©al. Quand ils ont mis les fl√®ches par terre √† Lionel-Groulx j'avais l'impression d'entrer dans une nouvelle √®re, mais en quelques semaines les gens se mettaient d√©j√† en plein milieu comme si ce n'√©tait pas l√†.
Ayant le privi√®ge d'√™tre un homme avec une carrure solide, parfois je faisais juste foncer dans le ''banc de poisson'' en sortant si les gens ne se tassaient pas. C'est pas vraiment la bonne chose √† faire, mais c'est d√©foulant parfois.
En plus il existe des lignes par terre qui indiquent o√π les portes ouvrent, non?
I had someone physically try to stop me from getting off.  She was some messed up lady and I excused myself to disembark at the famous crowded vendome disembarking and she was looking me straight in the eye and not letting me pass.  So, I'm not a giant, but I'm about 6 foot 200 lbs, which was enough to get me off the metro but she pulled at me and my backpack.  I had a train to catch but she was out of her fuckin mind.  I find riding the orange line when it is crowded, and having to get off at vendome to be one of the shittiest experiences in public transit....it's a fucking car commercial with more impact than anything you see on tv.
[Relevant](https://youtu.be/S-afAPOm5Ro?t=254)
√áa a toujours √©t√© comme √ßa. J'ai une solution simple... Marche vers l'avant, m√™me si tu rentres dans quelqu'un. Tant fucking pis pour eux s'ils se tiennent droit devant les portes et bougent pas. 
Note que je suis 6'2" et solide... Pas recommand√© si t'es pas pr√™t √† ramasser quelqu'un, mais g√©n√©ralement ils se tassent quand ils r√©alisent que tu niaises pas. J'ai vraiment ramass√© quelqu'un peut √™tre 3 fois en 15 ans, toujours un ado qui essaie d'impressionner ses amis. Je dois avouer que j'adore la face de "oh shit" quand quelqu'un r√©alise que tu t'en crisses et tu sors qu'ils bougent ou non.
Je sors pas les coudes ou rien, faut juste marcher et pas arr√™ter. Je pense qu'ils s'attendent tellement peu √† ce que quelqu'un fasse √ßa qu'ils pensent juste que je fais pas attention. Tant mieux.
I‚Äôll add on: people with their fucking smartphone stuck to their face while  going up/down the stairs in the stations during rushhour, slowing everyone the fuck down. Pull your fucking phone out of your face and move your ass out of the way
Derni√®re fois que j'ai pris le metro la STM avait commenc√© a mettre des lignes jaunes pour que le monde d√©barque/embarque.
C'est dr√¥le mais il y avait d√©j√† ces lignes dans d'autres pays et le monde en g√©n√©ral les respectaient, j'√©tais content de voir la m√™me m√©thode implant√© par la STM. 
J'assume que personne respecte ca ici selon op...lol
On peut parler des wagons aussi crott√©s ou sinon plus qu'avant? 
C'est tu du sang (jai vu √ßa de mes yeux, drette dans les vitres) ou juste du caf√© qui ch√®se? Pas d'importance, √ßa devrait √™tre impeccable. Aucunes raisons valables qu'en temps ou y'a moins de personnes qui utilisent cette soci√©t√© de transport Merdique.
stm, o√π le crit√®re d'embauche c'est : pas aimer transpirer quand tu "travailles" et pousser des craques √† leur clients, au travers de 2 pouces de vitre.
osti jles hais.
J'suis d'accord, y'en a toujours qui comprennent pas
Eux Salut, 
Je pense que j'ai une solution pas super dispendieuse.
Vu que les trains arr√™te pas mal exactement toujours a la m√™me place, on pourrait coup√© des petit dalot dans le plancher de ciment et remplir ca de LED et epoxy pour dessin√© un pattern vert/rouge avec des lignes et des fl√®ches pour attirer l'attention des pi√©tons et leur dire ou se tenir.
Je mets mes bras devant comme une zombie ou je les balance en sortant comme une diva. √áa tasse le monde et √ßa me fait rigoler.
Moi je leur dit, mais tu as raison, s√©rieux je comprend vraiment pas en 2021 que les gens on besoin de se faire dire cela. √áa et les sacs √† dos que les gens enl√®ve pas pis qui te criss dans face quand tu es assis et que eux bouge
What I‚Äôve noticed recently also is that people don‚Äôt want you to sit next to them on the bus or metro. If you‚Äôre that afraid of covid, don‚Äôt take public transport. How rude
il me semble que √ßa toujours √©t√© comme √ßa
Partout, tout le temps.  
Si tu veux rentrer quelque part.
Faut que tu laisses le monde sortir avant.
Other cities do things like have the timing of the next train in site of oncoming passengers. 
It is a small thing but it makes more sense to watch an app and think about how you will make the next connection than to think about the door in front of you that probably requires a hockey check to get through at any time of the year or if the escalator is working or the stairs are open for use at rush hour.
Ah, oui, c'est moi. Merci du poteau. Je ne vais plus monter en premier maintenant que tu me l'as fait remarquer !
Je ne pensais qu'√† moi jusqu'√† aujourd'hui mais apr√®s avoir lu ton post, je change mes mani√®res et je pense aux autres !
Aaaah, il fallait seulement que je tombe sur ton poteau !

I'm pretty ambivalent on tower height, but I have trouble believing that there's actually demand to build mega skyscrapers that tall in the first place
Does anyone else feel like this age of architecture is just flat out boring? I'm all for density and higher buildings, but we're not living a hundred years ago when a skyscraper meant the Empire State Building. Today's skyscrapers are just cheaply made boxes in the sky. Vancouver and Toronto are full of them and it's done nothing to relieve their housing crisis.  It's just turning them into a sea of soulless glass buildings that look identical to any other modern city in the world.
Pas besoin d'un parrain comme Cod√®re a la t√™te de cette ville. Plante a ses tords mais au moins c'est pas une mafieuse qui fait des faux appels d'offre et transfert des centaines de millions en fonds publiques a ses chums.
I always wonder what version of Montreal these articles refer to when they mention its soul. Even pre-pandemic Montreal has changed enormously compared to let's say early 2000's montreal.
My problem with buildings that are 10+ floors is that when they're all clustered, like they are downtown or griffintown, the sun doesn't hit the street anymore. It's genuinely cold to walk around downtown even when it's May and the sun is shining, and everything is in the shade. You can see that for some of these condos, people don't ever get natural sunlight in their units either.
We have a vacancy problem in the city. Appartements are at 6% and offices are at 14%. We don't need towers.
200m de hauteur c'est loin d'√™tre petit. Si le but c'est d'√™tre dense, c'est pas 200m+ ou rien. Paris fait 4x mieux que nous en terme de densit√© de population avec une limite de hauteur maximum des batiments de 30m.  Ath√®nes a 1.5x notre densit√© et a une limite de 30m. Y'a pas besoin de batiments de 300m de haut pour densifier.
I‚Äôm a fan of the rule that no tower is higher than the mountain. It probably has religious connotations with the cross on the mountain and all and even though I am not religious, I think it espouses humility which I think we can all agree is a good thing.
On peut √™tre critique, mais revenez-en aussi des gratte-ciels.  
[Dans *Le Devoir* du jeudi 8 septembre 1927](https://imgur.com/uo5lNMV), on parlait du premier gratte-ciel de la Banque Royale (consid√©r√© comme une horreur par l'auteur), des d√©rogations de hauteur pour pouvoir le construire, et la menace des futures tours de Bell et de la Sun Life.  
Est-ce qu'on consid√®re encore √† ce jour ces constructions comme des horreurs? Comme des d√©rogations inconcevables? Oui, toutes nouvelles tours ne sont pas des exemples d'architecture extraordinaire, mais de toujours revenir au fait que les gratte-ciels sont un reflet d'une perte de l'√¢me d'une ville ou d'une tache sur le paysage est redondant depuis *longtemps*.
Agreed, there is still a lot of room for downtown skyscrapers at 40 to 60 floors. And even more, room to grow 10-20 stories buildings in the expanded downtown and across the city near public services.
Urban development needs to occur where infrastructure can be expanded. Noone is going to build new sewers and schools and electrical downtown Montreal any time soon. Quebec needs to start focusing on a 2nd metropolis. Not make the existing one higher.
Montreal is in the midst of a renaissance and I don‚Äôt see why we some people are working so hard to stop it from taking leaps towards being a global city again. Taller high rises downtown won‚Äôt destroy neighbourhood life or make montreal less special. If anything it just adds to the prestige of the city and helps us attract more global talents to establish themselves here. That being said if they let buildings give higher they need to make sure the buildings contribute to the skyline and city in a positive way, none of these lifeless square buildings.
[deleted]
Je regardais justement la montagne a partir du pont Pie IX en pensant √† √ßa. Si le building a la meme hauteur que la montagne √ßa le cache anyway. C'est juste si il est plus grand et l'autre bord de la montagne que √ßa fait une diff√©rence.
Has rent followed local inflation or is there a correlation with city property taxes? How do landlords decide on what to charge for rent?
So either way more over priced micro condos that depreciate entirely in a decade and remain vacant for half that time.
Probablement une opinion peu populaire, mais: je serais OK pour augmenter les limites de hauteurs √† 250 m√®tres dans le quadrilat√®re approximatif de Ren√©-L√©vesque/Maisonneuve/De la Montagne/Bleury.
Change my mind.
Fucking Coderre‚Ä¶
Well then, (figuratively of course, I would not advocate or glorify violence on reddit, we love our corporate overlords) hang Coderre by the balls from the highest tower we have so far, and tell the asshole developers backing him that they're next.
We see what happens when they get what they want -- look at "New" Griffintown. Just a cluster of megatowers, with no forethought about how people will actually live there. No services, no schools, no nothing. Just a bunch of shoebox condos to sell. That's their only priority.
We need more density. Not one just giant empty Burj-Khalifa. That will not fix our problem
Montreal is selling its sould for unaffordable condos. I don't know how much more damage a new skyscraper could do.
C'est rare que j'upvote des articles de The Gazette, mais l√† √ßa vient chercher une corde sensible.
Toronto, new york or tokyo have tall buildings everywhere, and they are thriving. Montreal is already on a tiny island with not much space, there is not space to build horizontally, wanting to limit height is ridiculous. If it wants to stay in the past then Montreal won't evolve.
D'un c√¥t√©, le titre est int√©ressant. de l'autre, est-ce que j'ai envie de donner un clic √† un torchon francophobe comme The Gazette?
Si Plante ne veux pas de hauts immeubles faudrait nous dire ce qu'elle veut.
De nouveaux quartiers en p√©riph√©rie, donc couper  des arbres?
Remplacer des quartiers de 2-3 √©tages par des quartiers avec des b√¢timents plus haut, qui n√©cessiteront des √©viction de locataires en quantit√©?
Tenter de diminuer la population?
On peut pas juste s'opposer.
I think that MTL couldn‚Äôt practice secularism if it hit them in the face. 
The fact that buildings can be taller than a Christian cross just baffles me. And don‚Äôt even get me started on every single Catholic named public school, every street and town named after Catholics.
anglophonisation of Montr√©al already sold it's soul. It's just going to be Toronto Lite in 50 years which itself is New York diet.
Well, you can either build vertically or horizontally. Horizontally fucks the environment and nobody wants to live in a basement without windows so up it is.
edit: typos
TIL 19 and 25 storeys = mega skyscrapers
Maybe not a demand right now but right before the Pandemic, several towers were announced that were maxing out the height. These projects include the new proposal at Phillip Square, Quartier des Spectacles and the Banque Nationale building.
Agree with you, especially when there's plenty of other high rises still under construction, including [four right next to me off Sainte-Catherine.](https://i.imgur.com/1xRgJB0.jpg)
The project montreal made it legal to block the mountain
La demande n'est pas locale en tout cas...
Only if it has a bike path on top.
I agree 100%. Most new towers and condo building are ugly
Agreed 100%. I hate the new stuff. It has no soul and it certainly does not capture the essence of this city's spirit
I'm not saying you're wrong, but a lot of the buildings we love today were either controversial or boring in their day. The feeling that all architecture is the same is not unique to our era: building styles get repeated all over the place because they represent the most efficient known way to use the technology of the day to accommodate demand while conforming to the regulations in place.
The plexes we love in old neighborhoods were built en masse as the streetcars were extended. The iron spiral staircases didn't become the norm because they're charming, but because it let builders take advantage of the mandatory setbacks and cram in more units without wasting any of the building floor area on interior stairs. Hell, in a lot of North American cities, most of the "charming vintage bungalows" with "lots of character" were literally *ordered out of a fucking catalog*.
All this to say that eventually technology or laws or preferences will change again, and we'll stop building this style of glass tower (or 5-over-1 apartments, or whatever other overdone contemporary style). Some of them will get a facelift, and others will get torn down or replaced, and we'll start abusing some *other* style, and suddenly today's construction won't seem so bad. Some of them will even start to seem charming or classic, because that's what *always* happens as the context changes and we get some critical distance.
Not only that 50% of those towers in Toronto in Vancouver are empty. And they're so badly built you're going to have to replace all the glass at 10-15 years.
Il y a certains projets tr√®s beaux (L'Avenue, 628 Saint-Jacques) et il en y a des tr√®s laids (Tour des Canadiens 1, pas mal tout Griffintown). Je trouve qu'il y a une hausse de la qualit√© architecturale dans les projets propos√©s depuis 1 an (900 Saint-Jacques, le Mansfield, Baie d'Hudson), peut-√™tre car les terrains se rarifient. Par contre c'est clair qu'on est pas au m√™me niveau que la plupart des gratte-ciels d'avant 2010, qui √©taient construit par fiert√©.
Bring back the age of ornately carved masonry facades and gargoyles, just give them a modern twist... or just say fuck it and go straight back to the Art Deco aesthetic and call it a day. I'd be down with that.
> it's done nothing to relieve their housing crisis.  I
It hasn't done enough, I agree.  But that doesn't mean that it's done nothing.
> . It's just turning them into a sea of soulless glass buildings that look identical to any other modern city in the world. 
I agree with you, but I think what we need are prettier buildings, not fewer buildings.
> Does anyone else feel like this age of architecture is just flat out boring? 
Da faq? Looks like you need to travel a little bit...
Toronto is a shitshow when it comes to architecture (and other things).  Please don‚Äôt end up like Toronto.
Absolument! Tous les nouveaux √©difices sont de grandes tours de verre sans aucune √¢me et absolument d√©primantes √† regarder. Pire que des √©difices brutalistes. C'est affreux.
Y'a beaucoup plus d'espaces qui pourraient √™tre densifi√©s √† Montr√©al. Je pense notamment √† l'est o√π y'a plein de vieux plex pas r√©nov√©s en train de pourrir qui pourraient √™tre remplac√©s par de beaux √©difices de 4 √† 6 √©tages avec de beaux appartements familiaux.
Mais NOOOOOON. On pr√©f√®re faire des grandes fucking tours de marde o√π les unit√©s sont des petits 3 et demis de moins de 500 pi carr√©s avec une plomberie d√©fectueuse, sans luminosit√© o√π les habitants sont tous entass√©s.
Osti de syst√®me de marde.
C'est fou comment je vois passer des commentaires comment Plante gaspille des millions sur des pistes cyclables (t'as le droit d'√™tre en d√©saccord c'est vrai) et pensent que Coderre est un sauveur. C'est comme s'ils avaient compl√®tement oubli√© son dernier mandat et tous les d√©boires qui sont venus avec...
D√©sol√© mais dans le d√©neigement et la construction c'est rest√© pareille.
Va sur le site de la SEAO et regarde les contrats.
Certainly not the lifeless wasteland of high rise condos and starbucks it might become if we don't actively push back against it.
If that's the kind of soul you're looking for, move to Toronto.
That's easy. The soul of Montreal is exactly how it was when I first arrived here!
Comme ce beau petit p√¢t√© de condos ici?

Wait is this true? Would now be the best time to move out east
dommage pour les antennes
gorgeous capture!
Natural right? Nicely done. üëç
I can't stand digital image filters. They NEVER make a picture better. A real photographer uses their own skills to take great pics.
You always take such nice pictures. I love seeing Montr√©al through your lens. Keep up the good work!

This is a perfect photo.  First time I say this
This church is built on Mt Royal which is the highest point on the island of Montreal, so there quite a few cell phone antennas nearby. Otherwise, a beautiful photo!
Super belle photo!
Thank you!! :)
Yes, natural with some basic editing in Lightroom. However, all pictures should be edited in some form or another. When I take a shot, it is taken in RAW, which is just a digital negative which contains the most data possible so that the photographer can create a final image that best reflects their creative vision.
The same was done even in the analogue days of photography in darkrooms using chemicals on film!
Thanks so much! There's another pic in the series that you can see here!

Merci pour poster cet pi√®ce de po√©sie!
Thanks so much, what a compliment.
Indeed! And the Saint Joseph Oratory is the highest building in the city. 
According to Wikipedia: The Oratory is the [highest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation) building in Montreal, rising more than 30 meters above [Mount Royal's summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westmount_Summit), allowing it to be seen from many kilometers away.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Joseph%27s_Oratory#cite_note-Height-3) It is one of the few buildings that violates the height restriction under the municipal building code of Montreal, which limits the height of any building, including skycrapers, from surpassing the height of Mount Royal.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Joseph%27s_Oratory#cite_note-Municipal-4)
Arr√™tes de comparer ce qui se faisait dans une chambre noire en argentique vs les monstruosit√©s qui se font de nos jours dans Lightroom et Photoshop, √ß√† n'a rien √† voir... Puis se cacher derri√®re la ''vision cr√©ative'' c'est une excuse bidon...

I always find it interesting to hear about Mtl from an outsider's perspective, when as someone who was born here I'm so sick of it lol
Same thing happened to me 20 years ago and I never left.
I am an American from Chicago, I have a stressful job and plus I take care of my elderly parents one of which has dementia.  So...
Every month or two in the winter I started going to Montreal just for a little R&R....  
Don;t ask me how this happened. But I suddenly became friends with a bunch of sex workers: male, female, gay, straight.... I just happened to befriend a bunch of them on a freezing cold night when I stopped into this little bar because the wind and snow was brutal and I needed to warm up a bit before I kept walking.  Everyone so damn friendly and the next thing I know I am friends on FB with all of them. 
This started a tradition of me going up there every few weeks in the freezing bitter cold months.  I hang out with some of these people, drink, smoke and eat great food.  I party with them and i have a blast!  I have since met people who work in every walk of life and they are all just as cool and it's almost like they seem to know one another! 
You are going to love MTL and you are going to fall in love with the Quebecois.  (AKA people from Quebec)  They re the friendliest and most attractive people you can meet! 
Montreal, compared to other cities is a little dirty and kind of dumpy in spots. But it doesn't matter. The people and the friendly/open energy .  Congratulations and good luck in school!  Where are you going? UQUAM, McGill?
I moved here for university years ago and stayed. My daughter, who was born and grew up here said to me recently that wishes she could have gotten to move here from away. She thinks it‚Äôs such a great city and she‚Äôs a bit jealous of people who get to discover it and have the away from home experience here.
Im happy you enjoyed your stay! Summer in montreal is amazing
Any neighborhood you especially enjoyed?
Vancouver is so incredibly boring.
Everything good about Vancouver is outside of Vancouver.
Lol - I love Vancouver and I miss it dearly, but it‚Äôs social scene definitely wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúwild.‚Äù  
When I lived downtown, it made me laugh that a toy store was the only establishment on Robson St. that stayed open after 9 pm.  It was quite a surprise when I moved to downtown Toronto, and bars were busy on a THURSDAY!
We have inferior asian food and snow. If those doesn't turn you off, welcome to Mtl!
Hey! Me and my partner just moved out here from Victoria. Nice to see some BC folk kicking around. Feel free to message me if you want to grab drinks in the park or something:)
I grew up in Vancouver and then moved to Montreal for 2.5y, same opinion. I did miss the mountains (and family and friends obviously) but beyond that Montreal was just so much better.
In Boston now and debating moving back
Montreal is the best! Good people, good food, great art, so many different moods according to neighbourhood, no one cares how you dress, festivals for everything, friendly people all around and a culture that‚Äôs very focused on local support.
I‚Äôve been here for 20 years. I‚Äôve tried to leave but I always come back.
My only cons have been the construction and parking because even the winter is not so bad if you dress well and keep entertained with sports and the many activities the city has.
Welcome to our community. Enjoy the vibe :)
i love this. may i suggest following fucknomtl on instagram?
Awesome city and I miss it. Go have a meal at MEI's Chinese restaurant near Concordia. It's in the basement of Auberge L'Apero. Good place to stay and good food.
I'm glad you like it so far! 
After a while, you'll notice some flaws, but nothing you won't find in any other city. I've seen a lot of places, and Montr√©al truly is my home.
As someone who lived in Vancouver for around 5 years, there is no comparison! But maybe im biased as i was born here. I fucking love this city.
Quality of life is amazing here but comes winter time it's brutal. Cold, humid, snowy, i hate it. I prefer those vancouver or Denmark winters
Yes sir ya
it‚Äôs not summer all year round‚Ä¶
winter is coming...
Yeah it's fun at first but then you realize it sucks
I mean most cities are nice when you are 18 years old and living alone on family money. Maybe you should cut yourself off and re-evaluate.
More fun and open? Hmm that‚Äôs debatable there‚Äôs definitely more racism here and more NIMBYism. I would argue that Vancouver is more open.
You're writing in English. You don't need to put that accent-aigu on Montreal.
Oh i‚Äôm aware of what it‚Äôs like, I like cold more then heat anyways and anything to get away from the six months of rain, even if its ‚Äúfreeze your nostrils together‚Äù kinda cold
Some of us are from colder places than Montr√©al so being here is literally a win-win-win-win situation hehe
I can't wait for the winter to be here! Fuck this heat!
I‚Äôve only been in Montreal this last winter and I thought it was pretty mild compared to where I used to live. Could also be climate change.
I just moved here from Winnipeg and I'm so excited for winter here ü§£ anywhere has to be better than there haha
Same here. So sick of it. It feels like it has been the same for 20 years! But I do love Vancouver!!
Peut-√™tre que √ßa suck de m√™me mais √ßa bat n'importe quelle autre ville nord-americaine.
same! I live in Toronto now, but last night alone I kept hearing how much nicer Mtl is, If I didn't grew up there I would probably think the same
I've lived here for two years and it's miles above any other city I've lived in! I only got to experience the non-pandemic version for like four months though... and I was flat broke at the time too! Even then, I'd rather be poor or locked down in Montreal than not poor and  not locked down in Miami.
I felt this way until I moved away from Montreal to Vancouver. No amount of beaches and mountains replace that Montreal vibe.
you're still stuck in one-ways in Le Plateau ?
Thank you for the long comment ! For universities I don‚Äôt yet know where i‚Äôm going but i‚Äôm hoping on mcgill or concordia since those are the only two that wouldn‚Äôt force me to do an extra year of general courses.
How does Montreal compare to Chicago? I've been meaning to visit the windy city for a while now
I have the opposite feeling to her, so it goes to show you want what you can't have. :) 
I moved here from Ottawa and while I love this city, I wish I was perfectly bilingual or at least spoke good French, and making close friends as an adult is truly difficult.
 If I was born here like my boyfriend, I don't think I'd have as many fantasies of moving back home. (P.s. I did move back home and couldn't stand it; Ottawa is so boring).
I‚Äôve been staying in Outremont and that‚Äôs a really nice one, downtown around mcgill and st catherine is also really enjoyed wandering in.
Untrue. The sushi is everywhere üòÄ
Vancouver is amazing for people that like the Vancouver lifestyle. The draw isn't the city itself, but the mountains and beaches around the city, and the proximity of amazing areas like the sea to sky corridor.
Oh yeah vancouver is pretty dead in regards to things like that, robson has always been a big disappointment in terms of things to do, its just a bunch of chain stores and 11 bubble tea places, it always baffles me when people recommend it as an activity. Lmao
The asian food being under what i‚Äôm used too has been the biggest turnoff if i‚Äôm being honest, but oh well, we can‚Äôt have it all. Im very fine with the snow as long as it doesnt rain october to april i‚Äôm fine with any amount lmao.
Yeah the mountains i do miss, even just as an easy landmark to know where I am in the city.
If you move back, you'll be surprise to see how much more expensive it is to rent an appartment or buy a condo...
Thanks ! Im looking forward to moving next year !
Ooh thanks for the suggestion, i follow a bunch of bc meme pages on there but hadn‚Äôt gotten around to checking out the mtl selection
Will do ! I always love getting restaurant recs.
I recommend village mon-nan (corner La Gaucheti√®re / Clark) for their dumplings, great soups and delicious glazed duck.
Yaya
Do you know what is difference, besides colour, between white crosswalk and yellow crosswalk?
I see condos
Complete with the traditional road works
Jai vu un concert de Vivaldi illumin√© aux chandelles la cetait pas pire kewl
Tr√®s belle √©glise !
Where is this?
I was certain this was another church taken down post, and I had to read the title 3-4 times lol
I wonder if Montreal is one of the cities in North America with the most churches?
Or was that Philly?
it's cool, but also distressingly non-symmetrical.
Gimme a break. Why does every shot of Montreal contain construction?
I can see this offending so many people just because there's a church. You'll know who they are with the downvotes üòÖ
AFAIK, white zebra crossings are used near stop signs or traffic lights, which kind of limit the flow of traffic. 
Yellow crossings can be used in the middle of a street segment, away from traffic lights or stop signs, and are supposed to explicitly give priority to pedestrians.
Y a une traverse jaune √† cot√© de chez moi (Frontenac/Ontario) que personne ne respectait, donc ils ont ajout√© une mini lumi√®re pour pi√©tons. Quand m√™me fou √† quel point on manque de respect √† nos pi√©tons.
Une autre question similaire, vu qu'il semble y avoir des gens qui connaissent la r√©ponse: est-ce que des symboles de cyclistes jaunes donnent aussi la priorit√© aux cyclistes tout comme les passages pi√©tons jaunes le donnent aux pi√©tons?
That would be so sad. ;( This is such a great concert venue lol!

Not sure what the answer actually is, but Montr√©al is called "La ville aux cent clochers" or "The city with 100 bell towers".
I can‚Äôt remember his quote but Mark Twain visited our city sometime in the late 19th century and from a top Mont Royal admired the city‚Äôs churches and steeples. From what I understand is this church has gone under three different transformations, there may have been a fire in the 19th or 20th century so he may not have even seen this church in its current state.
I understand people who authorized building of churches committed heinous crimes in the past towards minorities and indigenous children but hate on the people who were responsible for it, not hate on the architecture. The architecture alone is still beautiful and needs to be preserved. The people are to blame not the architecture. If this makes sense. This is again my view as someone who recently came to Montreal and I have still yet to understand the complicated politics of this place. Hope this is not offensive to anyone.
If you look near the statue someone graffitied ‚Äúfuck the church‚Äù
I don't understand why it's offensive? I am a Hindu and not even a Christian but I find Churches so beautiful and aesthetic. It's probably my favourite aesthetics in architecture. All I've been doing is clicking so many pictures of churches from different angles. ‚ù§Ô∏è
If only...
You are correct. Have an upvote.
Je suis d'accord avec vous, la Ville a manqu√© de respect. Cela ne date pas depuis hier que les automobilistes ne donnent pas la priorit√© aux pi√©tons dans une ¬´¬†[stroad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORzNZUeUHAM&) ¬ª (√† cause de plusieurs facteurs). On savait, au niveau urbanisme, que les pi√©tons n'auront pas priorit√©, la Ville a quand m√™me choisi de mettre une traverse sans lumi√®re.
Malheureusement je trouve que c‚Äôest autant les cyclistes comme les automobilistes qui n‚Äôont aucun respect pour les pi√©tons. Le nombre de fois que je vois les cyclistes pas s‚Äôarr√™ter pour laisser traverser des enfants ayant a l‚Äô√©cole ou m√™me d‚Äôarr√™ter pour un autobus jaune qui flash s‚Äôest lumi√®res de stop. 
C‚Äôest trash

Damn. Good eyes.
I don't personally find it offensive. But you have a group of people here that want to remove anything related to religion and if you say anything religious or anything against their views then you are wrong and they are right. Just because someone is offended it doesn't mean that person is right...

This is somewhat tengential (maybe - haven't actually watched it yet) but interesting I think:
For a long time, adoption in Quebec was based on religion. In the sense that Catholic babies had to be adopted by Catholics, Jewish babies by Jews, etc. However there weren't enough Jewish children up for adoption to give all Jewish couples having trouble conceiving the possibility of adopting. On the flip side, there was an excess of Catholic babies. This led to a black market where unwed Catholic mothers would have their babies adopted by Jewish families in Montreal, and even down in New York. Iirc, money changed hands.
I know someone who was one of those babies. Didn't find out until she was in her 40s or something crazy like that.
Grandma's of that era are truly something special. I'm happy she was able to find herself.
Nakuset is really an extraordinary person. Her work at the Native Women's Shelter is awe-inspiring. I donate to them without fail every year. If you're looking for a good non-profit to send donations, they have a really great team and see a lot of results.
Thank you for sharing. The way her voice cracked when she said "I wanted to be loved" -- fuck.
I'm glad her Bubby helped her reclaim herself and that she is able to give her own kids what she didn't have.
I was also adopted by a Jewish family in Montreal, except I have nothing but good things to say about them. They gave me opportunity when I had none.
I happened to watch this a few weeks ago, it‚Äôs crazy that no matter how much I think I know about the native populations struggles I always find new and terrible additions to the already depressing story
I've no words to express my sadness for that woman, her childhood and her family lives were broken for good. Hope they would reunite again and find some peace and love stolen from them.
I knew a family like that, Jewish and adopted a Cree girl, but not sure where from. I don't know how they came to adopt her (didn't know them well) but apparently her bio mother was a teenager, like 15. They were a very nice family with 2 other biological kids, raised her as Jewish but never lied to her about her background or anything and were all very open about it. She eventually did reunite with her bio family, but didn't really connect with them and she doesn't seem to have much contact with them...I get the feeling the reunion didn't go that well.
>For a long time, adoption in Quebec was based on religion. In the sense that Catholic babies had to be adopted by Catholics, Jewish babies by Jews, etc.
Just a quick comment to add. I know that today, cultural relevance is an important part of youth protections foster and adoption services. The 60's involved a terrible moment referred to as the 60's scoop. This involved the government "scooping up" indigenous children from their homes and placing them for adoption into white families, specifically to assimilate them. These movements were largely run by the Catholic church and the canadian government. I would imagine that if there were shortages of Jewish children to adopt, those families would be more likely to adopt an indigenous child as they were so available and first to be placed with white families.
Religion was a dividing line much moreso than language. It's why you find a lot of francophones with Irish last names - if you've ever met a nearly unilingual O'Neill, it's probably because as Catholics they were welcomed more by the largely Catholic French speakers than the Protestant English ones.
She‚Äôs truly incredible!! A hard worker who makes things happen!
I think Nakuset was very self-loathing due to her adoptive parents putting down her heritage, and by extension her, for all of her childhood. It depends if you faced any racism, what color is your skin? Are you/do you pass as caucasian?
Seems like the right way to raise an adopted child!
The 60s scoop continues to this day. It's not over.
That also comes from Irish orphans of the potato famine being adopted into French speaking families.
I'm Native American, and I do not pass as Caucasian. But to be honest, I don't feel like I have really experienced any racism in my life. And it's not like my family barred me from getting in touch with my "roots", it just wasn't something I was interested in. In any case my tribe is from Manitoba so it wasn't really realistic for me growing up anyways.
Oh absolutely. As a social worker who has worked in youth protection, I am painfully aware. My comment was simply meant to illustrate that there was actually very little attempt at culturally matched foster homes and adoption, contrary to the initial comment in the thread. Sadly, to this day first Nations children are 6-10x more likely to be removed from home and placed in foster care or the youth criminal justice system. This trend continues into adulthood where they are more likely to be incarcerated.

Not exactly the same situation, but you might be interested in Rabbi Angela Buchdahl‚Äôs story. Her dad is Ashkenazi and her mom is Korean Buddhist. She has interesting things to say about belonging to more than one tribe. [Here‚Äôs](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FNhG8aW6gbI) one example.
Oh cool!
Thank you for your dedication and your awareness. I wish social services to get more funding and cultural considerations.

This is actually a great photo, not just for what it shows, but also for what it doesn‚Äôt; if you were to take the photo from literally 15 seconds away, on the corner of de Maisonneuve and Crescent, it‚Äôs not at ALL this nice. 
Lately, it‚Äôs been a cesspool. 
The angle of this picture is clever because it hides that ugliness behind natural obstacles. Very nice!
Its very strange to see Crescent this empty. I left Montreal last year so I only saw a bit of the pandemic there, but I would have thought it'd be bustling again now with everything open.

 Je suis un vieux boomer et j'ai travaill√© au centre-ville toute ma vie. √áa m'attriste profond√©ment que le centre-ville de Montr√©al soit en train de crever. 
J'ai toujours pens√© que c'√©tait le coeur de Montr√©al. La COVID et la destruction de Sainte-Catherine vont l'achever.
Hein?? Une murale l√†?? Je l'ai jamais vu, de quoi tu parles?

C'est Leonard Cohen.
En tant que vieux Boomer, on aurait esp√©r√© un peu plus de recul avant d'annoncer la mort du centre-ville en se basant sur \*une\* photo de Crescent un samedi pluvieux.  
Et surtout sur ce tron√ßon de Crescent, y'a jamais grand monde anyway.
It was a rainy Saturday....it would have been this empty precovid.... fucking boomers

Cest de maisoneuve et crescent. En general il y a pas mal de monde mais rarement de jour.
√âvidement, je suis un vieux con et la seul vue d'une photo de Crescent vide me fait paniquer. Je pourrai aussi r√©pondre de fa√ßon m√©prisante, mais on m'a appris √† demeurer poli. 
De fa√ßon √©vidente, ce n'est pas juste √ßa. La covid a avanc√© le mouvement vers le t√©l√©travail de peut-√™tre 10 ans. Au boulot on m'a demand√© de calculer le temps (et les Km et le CO2) et je dois dire que c'est impressionnant. Les gens vont se rendre compte que passer 2 heures par jours √† voyager de la maison au bureau ne fait aucun sens -que ce soit en auto ou en transport en commun.
Not sure, there maybe have been less people than if it was a sunny day, but zero?
Non
Common mistake, that's Leonard Nimoy
Le vieux Boomer devrait faire un petit aller-retour de 2 heures au centre-ville de temps en temps, il verrait que tranquillement la vie recommence √† y revenir.
It is a portrait of Anthony Bourdain who reviewed a nearby restaurant in one of his TV shows.

Probably lacking water.
I've been wondering about that too. Turns out Montreal is having an "abnormally dry" summer, on the verge of being in a moderate drought:
[https://agriculture.canada.ca/en/agriculture-and-environment/drought-watch-and-agroclimate/canadian-drought-monitor](https://agriculture.canada.ca/en/agriculture-and-environment/drought-watch-and-agroclimate/canadian-drought-monitor)
The lack of water creates a lot of stress in trees, especially those that are most common here like maples, which may cause them to drop their leaves early.
C'est normal quand il y a tr√®s peu d'averses durant toute une saison...
Les plantes en arrachent cette √©t√©.
Climate change‚ú®
I am in St. Jerome and noticed this as well.  Maple trees turning red and yellow.  Kind of early‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
NOOOOOO PLEASE GO NO ! NO NO NO NO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
D'apr√®s une amie permacultrice, un √©t√© plus pr√©coce et chaud a accel√©r√© la floraison de certaines plantes, survenue plus t√¥t dans la saison. Peut-√™tre que certains arbres sont √©galement en avance?
There's some trees varieties that will as you approach Fall.
Then obviously lacking water will just accelerate the process.
Je me posais la m√™me question. Merci.
Quelques feuilles rouges √† Tremblant‚Ä¶.yep.
Probably lacks of water, but there have been a lot of maple leaves that froze at the end of May when we got some late below zero temperature. These are still brown as of today.
Yes it‚Äôs normal, been happening all my life. Some years less, some years more.
Oui.
The tree in my front yard has already started turning yellow and the leaves are falling like it‚Äôs the end of September üò≠
it's been very dry, and I noticed this as well. 
Also, leaves change as the days grow shorter.
Je suis revenue de vacances hier et cela m‚Äôa frapp√© aussi.  Beaucoup de feuilles ont chang√© de couleurs ou sont tomb√©es.  Les arbres ont faits leurs feuilles t√¥t  ce printemps.  Je me demande si cela pourrait aussi √™tre une cause?
Je ne sais pas a propos des feuilles, mais la photo est vraiment tr√®s belle!
Thats normal it's a dry summer.  In lebanon where I am from, leaves and grass turn yellow because in the summer for 4 months straight it does not rain at all not even one drop.
I saw a bunch of outardes leaving yesterday in their usual V formation. It's way too fucking early for that :(
J'ai remarqu√© la m√™me chose au Nouveau Brunswick...

Maybe due to climate  change.We have done  a very complete  job of  messing up  a beautiful  world!
Yes
I noticed the same in Brampton(Ontario) in my yard yesterday,  there has been plenty of rain around here...mnot sure what's the reason
I have noticed the same here in Quebec city!
Climate change, better introduce another tax!
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooo
we are so fucked.
Now I'm trying to figure out where this picture was taken in MTL.
Autumn.
Many tress are stressing this summer, the city environment is already pretty brutal but the heat wave is really getting to them. Kind of like us.
Damn you, global warming!!
Yes
New normal?
Yes. Some trees do.
Yes, but it‚Äôs been very dry lately
Yes/Oui
I have a giant tree in my back yard, and some of the leaves turned yellow already. We were gone for a month and got back last week, so I'm not sure how dry it got, but I'm blaming it on a lack of rain.
ya pas eu de pluies buddy
Yup.
Il a fait 10C la plus part des nuits de juillet
yup that's what we call "aoutement" the days are getting shorter, and the leaves have started producing anthocyanin.
They're getting ready to shed and for winter
No, call the city and have them come look at it immediately....
Depending on the essence of the tree.
Not normal
Voil√†, la s√©cheresse les a frapp√© fort au printemps et les feuilles jaunissent. Ce n'est pas vraiment le m√™me processus que le changement de couleur en automne.
This is going to happen more often in the future given that the affects of climate change are already here and only getting worse
This is the new normal.
Translation: it is normal when there was very little precipitation during the whole season.
The plants struggled this summer
Nice photo, where is it taken from?
The leaves also look droopy like they are lacking water, just not enough rain this year.

It doesn't work in the rain... or snow... or when there are too many leaves.

And what's the actual function of these navettes?
Playmobil font des vrais v√©hicules? Aussi laids que leurs jouets??
20km/h max on a preset path (which also had to have work done on it to prepare it for the shuttle), barely fits half a dozen people and still needs a worker on board.
Not quite sure what the purpose is honestly.
Tellement d'accord avec toi, c'est de la nouvelle tech c'est s√ªr que √ßa va pas √™tre parfait d√®s le d√©but. Je me souviens pas exactment o√π mais j'avais vu un vid√©o ya quelques ann√©es sur des navettes semblables et d√©j√† celles sur St-Hubert sont beaucoup plus avanc√©es que celles-l√†.

Hey, ceux qui downvotent, je veux pas voir comment c'est d√©cor√© chez vous.... votre sens de l'esth√©tique me fait peur....
> Not quite sure what the purpose is honestly.
To enable people to move around, but also to test the technology and to test this solution in the context of mobility adapted to special needs users (elderly, kids, etc...) with the stated goal of collecting citizens' comments about the project.
> 20km/h max 
Your average walker goes at 5 hm/h.
>on a preset path (which also had to have work done on it to prepare it for the shuttle), 
Paths are preset and work is also done to prepare for bus lanes, tram lanes, train lanes, metro lanes, and bike lanes.
>barely fits half a dozen people 
Taxis can fit even less people, should they be banned? What about rental bikes with only 1 person per bike? Surely that's even worse, going by this metric...
>and still needs a worker on board.
I'd wager that the worker is there primarily for public perception and collecting comments.
It's still on an experimental / testing phase. That's basically how any technology-based project works: ideate ‚Üí design ‚Üí test (with multiple iterations) ‚Üí implement.
elderly assistance prolly
Gotta learn to walk before you can run.
a Luxembourg style downtown or high street bus that lets people maintain a sense of autonomy. 
I imagine this is a Quebec build which is crap but the concept can actually be interesting for those who cant drive opposed to other ideas
Trois
I actually think the middle guy with the reflective jacket is the employee. There's no steering wheel, the guy in front is just on his phone chilling. The "conductor" is in the middle, letting people in and out I believe.
The two others are the riders, but still surprised neither have to wear a mask... They're still in a confined space, I don't see how it's any different than taxi or bus.
c'est des complotiss
La navette est en test. Elle ne transporte pas de passager. Donc le masque n'est pas vraiment n√©cessaire pour le moment.
Interesting. Looking up Keolis, they're not a self driving company. It looks they are buying/licensing the technology from Navya, a company that was created from the liquidation of a previous company called Induct which produced the Navia vehicle (pretty much the shuttle on St Hubert). This is a product that has benefitted from multiple European Union grants, both at Induct and Navya, in collaboration with univerties in France, Belgium, Switzerland and Germany. 
I was hoping this was a Canadian effort, since I think we have the people and resources to build self driving cars in Canada (in addition to one of the ultimate testing environments). But it is still nice to see a player in the market that is the result of a publicly funded multinational collaboration.
More info about induct and Navya:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navya_SAS
Oh ok
> Your average walker goes at 5 hm/h.
> Taxis can fit even less people
These are strange comparisons. Walking doesn't require an employee and isn't limited to a preset path. Taxis do require someone but also go 2-3x faster and also don't require a preset path.
The actual closest comparison is a bus. Preset path (but can improvise if needed), requires same number of employees and goes 2-3x faster. It also can potentially fit a lot more people, though if you don't need as many, you can use a smaller shuttle too.
The only case where self-driving is useful is if it doesn't require an employee, allowing you to run hundreds of them around the city 24/7, especially useful at night where traffic doesn't matter, but getting an employee to work night shift does.
But at that point it would be cheaper to use one of those elderly shuttles.
More flexible, same number of employees, faster speeds, any path required.
>I imagine this is a Quebec build which is crap
Why would it be crap if it is built in Quebec? All STM busses are built by NovaBus in Ste-Eustache, they must be crap right?
I live there, the guy with the orange jacket is a maintenance guy that empty trash and cleans windows. He is not the driver. I see him everyday, he is a great guy.  He has nothing to do with the self driving car but I am sure ybe one of the most frequent user. 
I live on St Andr√© where that was film.

This is an experiment. My understanding is that there is an employee at the moment for safety purposes until the route set is fully analyzed with real data and that in a few months it might be tested without any employee.
we cant even get metro without drivers. you think they're gonna let a mini bus drive it self?
You're not wrong, but someone's getting a nice little enveloppe from this
what has come out of Quebec besides circe de Soleil that is noteworthy? 
Moreover this shit exists everywhere else so no some cunt in st Eustache making does not make it special. Like the rest of the crap that is made in Quebec it will probably get rear ended by may and be off the road both ways
As an Anglo, I‚Äôm 100% for protecting the French language but this shit is overreaching and useless..
The CAQ is just bringing up the language debate as a weapon to use for the election meanwhile we should be focusing on other things like the pandemic and the post-pandemic economy‚Ä¶
It's weird to me that the CAQ wants a reduction of services. Instead of having things in French with a section in English they want.... just french?
It's kind of a silly hill to die on.

Les Qu√©b√©cois sont les gens les plus bilingues au Canada. Tout le monde est d'accord pour dire que le bilinguisme individuel est une richesse.

ah yes, let's improve the effectiveness of our health/social services by making it even more difficult for an already majority English-speaking population. Let's get Ottawa to employ this strategy in Vanier.
107 comments by mid morning.  R/montreal did not disappoint today.
Why shouldn't every municipality be allowed to choose for itself what languages it operates in? What could be the argument for doing anything else?
What is the harm in providing services in an additional language? There is some additional cost, but if the majority in that community wants service in that language and is willing to pay for it, what argument could there be in having a higher level of government forbid it?
I am a proud bilingual Qu√©b√©cois and to me protecting French does not mean attacking English...

I say let the CAQ fall on their own sword, if the want French let them have it. Reality and legislation are two entirely different variables. Let‚Äôs see if candidates will come out to fight against the direction QC is heading in.
Let‚Äôs be honest Legault isn‚Äôt doing this for the Montreal votes, since no one really cares about being bilingual here, it‚Äôs for the votes in Abitibi and up north Quebec where they have never met an Anglo and believe only what‚Äôs on super conservative propaganda stations. 
As an Anglo who went to school in English in the West, I am very pro all schools should be 65% French education and 35% English. (You can even do 75-25) So those who speak only French at home will have better opportunities at multinationals, and Anglos will have better times assimilating in French culture. 
It‚Äôs a stupid fight but it‚Äôs a fight to get him votes

Oh no, look over there, the health care system isn‚Äôt fucked and the CHLDs aren‚Äôt horrific places to be old and die in, quick, ah, a reliable distraction!
French and English living in harmony is not compatible with the Quebec nationalist movement.
I really fail to see how some anglophone west island municipalities that have been anglophone longer than Bill 101 has been around are a threat to the French language.
The west island isn't going to become French speaking overnight just because the politicians and some hardline nationalists who have probably never stepped foot in places like Kirkland or DDO want it to. A lot of those west island anglophones that I grew up with are fully bilingual and some even went to French high schools. The ones that aren't left the province (good riddance). 
Municipalities in Ontario btw are designated bilingual when francophones make up 10% of the population, or 5000 people for cities (like Toronto) and francophones are defined as people who have French as their first official language spoken, not just with French as their mother tongue, maybe given the reality of life in anglophone municipalities here, where English speakers might have spoken Tamil, mandarin, Italian, Greek or any other language as a first language but speak mostly English now, we should probably use the same definition here for English speakers.
Obviously I'm not going to say that we should only have 10% of anglophones living in a given area to designate the given area to be bilingual because that would be ridiculous. But I think if 60% of the population speaks English as a language at home, then they should be offered services in English. 
Kirkland is 67% English speaking and c√¥te st Luc is 60% English speaking according to the 2016 census so this is a little bit ridiculous tbh. 
Encourage people to learn French, everyone in this province should have a functioning knowledge of French, but don't take away the rights of people who have been living in the west island for decades just for some politic points.
but seriously, nothing will come out of this. This is just a ploy to make Francophones happy. the "review" won't result in anything
Someone would have to show that bilingualism works in Canada to preserve French because all the evidence goes the other way. When this is proven we can discuss institutional bilingualism in Quebec.
This goes up there with the CAQ and PQ governments wanting to apply Bill 101 to CEGEPs. Yes, force adults to go only to French schools...see how well that works out for you. Basically, the idea is that, if they handicap Quebecers by forcing them to be unilingual, they can't leave and get a job elsewhere.
[deleted]
Can someone explain to me the argument of ‚ÄúROC isn‚Äôt bilingual, so we don‚Äôt have to be.‚Äù Don‚Äôt all Canadian municipalities with a francophone minority offer services in French?
Fighting old wars for political capital.
Apparently Bilingualism is good in Qu√©bec, when it favors anglophones, but not in Ontario when it favours minority francophones?

*Bottausci himself is ‚Äúproudly trilingual.‚Äù He speaks English, French, Italian and some Spanish.*
*‚ÄúI always say, languages are a richness,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe French language, let‚Äôs embrace it. Rather than being oppressive, let‚Äôs promote it and embed it inside our brains, encode it. Je suis totalement d‚Äôaccord avec ca.‚Äù*
Per aggiungere un commento nella terza lingua del sindaco: sono completamente d‚Äôaccordo con lui che ‚Äúlingue sono ricchezza‚Äù. Non vivendo in Quebec sono molto ammirativo della vostra capacit√† di saltare da una lingua all‚Äôaltra, mischiandole e spesso storpiando entrambi per creare qualcosa di nuovo. 
Keep up il buon lavoro, et ne vous faites pas dictate da nessuno in which language vous pouvez causer.
Would anglo Quebeckers ever support restarting the Equality party?  They won 4 seats in the 1989 election.
**"Bilingual is beautiful"** so lets merge every school's curriculum and have mixed classes of french and english students. 
I'm kicking myself years later for growing up in the west island going to an english school, there is such a disconnect from quebec culture and french language. 
I'm now working at a company with +500 people that mostly all speak quebecois french and I don't relate to them at all, most of their jokes go right by me and there is very little to no camaraderie between us.
english schools don't want to change/budge even an inch and french schools neither.
also when I look back, my whole school was mostly made up of white english students, but other people I know that went to french school downtown, white french kids were the minority and classes were +80% immigrants.  
If all schools merged their curriculum we could let immigrant parents choose whatever school they want and they would learn both english and french, win win
How about trilingual?
Vous avez vraiment un dont les anglos pour vous faire d√©tester ? Vous vous rendez compte que vous √™tes borderline raciste ? Le bilinguiste c'est juste un outil pour aider les unilingues lol ca n'aide en rien le francais.
Heureusement que le parlement n'est plus √† Montr√©al. La gazette organiserait une √©meute pour le br√ªler comme elle l'avait fait en 1849. https://fr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incendie_de_l'h%C3%B4tel_du_Parlement_%C3%A0_Montr%C3%A9al
Meh.
Over the years, I've come to notice that there's a lot of overlap between avowed proponents of institutional bilingualism in Quebec and people who just want to dispense themselves entirely from the *fait fran√ßais* in Quebec. Either because they are annoyed/inconvenienced by it or because of more ideological motives.
Personally, I'm comfortable with municipalities made up of 50%+ anglophones providing services in both French and English. Below that threshold, I expect provincial government institutions to offer services in the sole official language of Quebec.
[deleted]
No matter what this is officially a french province, that includes the west island. Sorry guys.
Why do Waste island refuse to accept that they are in Qu√©bec? Everytime I go there people refuse to serve me in French.
I'll agree with you if you can say that shit in French

Gotta divert attention from how fucked up our healthcare system is amirite. Classic misdirection from an incompetent government. Pretty sure they are just trying to fill up the news cycle with garbage
I'm not anglo and it's so petty that this government is wasting energy on this
> we should be focusing on other things like the pandemic and the post-pandemic economy‚Ä¶
Well of course you wouldn't want a debate to center around *that* considering how disastrous the performance of our premier was compared to the rest of Canada.
Journalist: "How will you answer to your opposition's accusations at mishandling the COVID-19 pandemic?"             
Legault: "Fuck les anglos"

pretty much everyone I know who lives in a ''developed' country has gotten at least one vaccine dose now, meanwhile our stupid gov is debating whether students in the french system should have the right to choose English cegeps
"100% pour", c'est pas assez pour l'√©crire, hein?
Do we get a reduction in our taxes since we get a reduction in services?
CAQ is and always was a nationalist party with strong views on protecting french culturally. I don't see anything surprising here to be honest. It is no different than trying to stop french kids attending english cegeps. Many of those people just want english immersion to improve their bilingualism. 
These groups of people fear cultural change. Ironically, Quebec french has itself diverged from it's origins in France and the french they speak there.
C'est quoi le rapport entre les deux?

Hi, mathematician here.
Yes, it is hte hottest june 6th in 90 years.
Yes, global warming / climate change is real and caused by humans and a vital concern of anyone who is serious about ensuring a future for us, our eventual kids, grandkids, humanity, etc.
**BUT**
These "record-breaking days" don't really mean much. In fact, a simple, rigorous analysis of this data does NOT show that June 6th has been warm more often in the recent past than in the distant past -- looking at this data you could in fact make a case that it's been getting somewhat cooler on average over the last 60 years...
**SO**
Posting stuff like that is just more mediatic noise. While this is, technically speaking, not *misinformation*, it is somewhat misleading, and it just makes discourse around climate change more fuzzy than it needs to be.
That being said it is hot in here.
oh so it's hot?
Bient√¥t, 31 degr√©s sera une temp√©rature fra√Æche √† Montr√©al, cette √©tuve √† ciel ouvert.
[deleted]
Records are meant to be beaten
I was removing the floor in my newly brought home today.
Fucking hell it was terribly hot.
Coldest for the next hundred or so, too.
La pertinence d‚Äôun 3e rang dans le classement des temp√©ratures maximum pour une date particuli√®re est questionable. Qu‚Äôest-ce qu‚Äôon peut vraiment tirer comme conclusion √† partir de cette donn√©e en consid√©rant le tableau et le graphique?
Edit: Je ne dis pas que les changements climatiques ne sont pas une r√©alit√©. Les temp√©ratures moyennes mondiales augmentent √† un rythme alarmant. Mais les canicules ne tombent pas toutes aux m√™mes moments de l‚Äô√©t√©, tout comme les grosses bord√©es de neiges ne tombent pas toute aux m√™mes dates l‚Äôhiver. Preuve: les temp√©ratures du 6 juin en 1925 et 1930. Une seule donn√©e qui sort quelque peu de l‚Äôordinaire n‚Äôest pas si importante. Il faudrait la mettre en contexte pour qu'elle soit significative.

A few weeks ago, didn't we have a hottest day in 100 years?

J'ai comme l'impression que c'est du free karma consid√©rant que avec le r√©chauffement climatique, l'√©t√© devient plus chaud a chaque jours anyway lol
OP n'a pas parl√© de r√©chauffement climatique, il ne fait que souligner les records m√©t√©orologiques (regarde son nom d'usager...). C'est toi qui pr√™te des intentions d'OP.
I could probably also call myself a mathematician.  While I don't have a degree in math, nor do I work in a math field, I did take university level statistics (and got "A+").  I understand the statistical significance (or insignificance) of my statements.
Yeah. I rarely post about climate.  Almost all of my posts are just weather.
A lot of people try to interpret my post to be some statement either for or against global warming.  And they are usually either disappointed, angered, or come to invalid conclusion(s).
In general, this post should be read like, "It's unusually hot outside." and that's really all.
Agreed that June 6th hasn't in this case, but if a similar analysis is done for all June days daily maximum temperatures are increasing and the phenomena is worse when analyzed in winter. When daily maximum records are being broken every month and near maximum records are being reached every week that is the dangerous trend that this data should be analyzed in regards to imo.
"today is the rainiest 3rd Thursday of the month where there's a waning moon in the last 24 years" ...these fucking posts every time
Yes global warming is real, but you're just posting random data and acting like it's a phenomenon
How dare youuuu
Wow, it‚Äôs hard to imagine ‚Äúhere‚Äù being this hot ü•µ. ü§£ü§£ü§£. Can you be more specific about your location?
But where is here??
Kuwait?
You've got 2 DUIs? Hold my beer.
hundred thousand I think you will find.
Je ne vois pas pourquoi tu te fais down voted. En fait, je ne sais plus trop √† quelle date, mais je sais que dans le pass√© on ne faisait pas les mesures m√©t√©orologiques de fa√ßon standard, alors c'est possible que les mesures avant 1930 ne soient pas parfaitement valide.
Et pour revenir sur ta question, c'est vraie que de regarder une date avec un record √ßa ne veut rien dire. Par contre si on regarde depuis les 2-3 derni√®res ann√©es, on se rend compte qu'on bat de plus en plus de record. Quand je regarde cette image, √ßa ne veut rien dire d'autre qu'une distribution normale.
Tu as totalement raison, on ne peut tout simplement pas utiliser les donn√©es d'une journ√©e pour d√©terminer des changements dans le climat.
Thank you.  You are correct.
Les intentions du/de la posteur.e originale m'int√©ressent moyen, honn√™tement.
Il y a toujours un contexte et un sous-texte quand tu partages une nouvelle ou une information. Peut-√™tre que OP n'a pas d'intentions mais dans la section des commentaires, √©videmment qu'on fait allusion aux changements climatiques. C'est pour √ßa que √ßa reste pertinent de formuler une mise en garde.
yeah i could prolly call myself everything i want following that logic lmao
This got me thinking about "record-breaking days".
The data exists and goes back a long way it seems -- so I could easily program a thing that will output which days were "record-breaking"... That's a fun june project ! Maybe I'll even write something up...
Unless I'm missing something, it doesn't seem like OP is making a statement about global warming. They're just posting weather records.
You should see the garbage they pull about the queens on drag race. It's the worst.

My intention is to celebrate weather and unusual weather.  I use the word celebrate quite intentionally here.  While some of the extreme weather I discuss may be uncomfortable, or even fatal to some, I try to enjoy what the world brings to us.
J'ai confiance en l'intelligence des gens pour faire la part des choses depuis le temps qu'on parle de climat et de m√©t√©o. De parler d'un record journalier de temp√©rature ou de pr√©cipitation a peu de chose √† voir avec une tendance g√©n√©rale √† long terme comme le r√©chauffement climatique ou m√™me avec une tendance saisonni√®re induite par l'Oscillation Australe / El Nino par exemple. Ce n'est qu'en analysant plusieurs de ces journ√©es qu'on peut lier les deux.
Si √ßa t'int√©resse, je suis tomb√© r√©cemment sur [un graphique int√©ressant d'un climatologue √† ce sujet](https://twitter.com/ZLabe/status/1397310329927835651/photo/1).
That would be awesome!
But WHY are they so interested in weather records ?
It always gets me when people say "I'm not passing judgement on [xyz], I'm just stating a fact!"
The facts you choose to state say something too.

Not at all what I'm saying. But I am saying that it's obvious that a lot pf people are concerned about climate change and, in this context, posting specifically about weather records such as this one can be a bit misleading.
Y a l air d avoir tellement de monde.... c'est dommage y a pas si longtemps c √©tait encore un petit coin bien cach√© de Montr√©al

Lol think this is bad? Just wait til that fucking train gets going, sometimes they just park it on the tracks blocking the path for 20 minutes.
champlain was closed and all traffic diverted to that area, there is a bike crossing right at the road with a stop sign for cars, some cars let the bikers go past and other bikers stopped to let the cars go pass
Montr√©al est tellement rendue congestionn√©e que m√™me les v√©los font du bumper √† bumper (ou du roue √† roue).

Wow bikers actually following rules! What!!!
Time to complain. Don't forget that the cyclists need to physically push the button for the light to activate for them (which is out of norm) and the button is on the left side of the road, after the stop line (out of norm) as of 2 years ago
Light doesn't change even without any car traffic at all, cycling traffic is least considered.
The more we all complain, the more likely is it that there is change.
[https://montreal.ca/en/how-to/report-issue-traffic-light](https://montreal.ca/en/how-to/report-issue-traffic-light)
Thing I had begun to do 2 years ago (I don't go there anymore) is take the road with the cars when going towards the city. Still had to wait on the way back. Still legal, way faster most of the time.
5 bikes had time to pass before it turned yellow when I passed there today. 
Too short time == more bikes that won‚Äôt wait for this traffic lights.

not to point the obvious but cyclist dont have to just hold a pedal down either, they have to get started cutting down on how many can go in those 11 seconds.
Id love to complain but don‚Äôt know what to mention. Help me out?
Edit: I don‚Äôt bike
The button thing is pretty common in European cities with bicycle networks, especially when sensors are not a great option, but 11 seconds is nuts. They could even make the time to cross vary depending on the time of day.

Chanceuse :(
Improper timing leading to cyclist jams without car jams (too short for cyclists, too long for cars, often no car passes while cyclists wait), position of 'beg buttons' is wrong (on left, after stop line for cyclists). Too long lights lead to severe disobedience from both cyclists and cars, making the intersection unsafe.
IIRC, cyclists had less than 15 seconds to cross, often having to wait for the cars still crossing on red even on cyclist green light. Timing may have changed since 2019, but it often was not enough, while it always was more than enough for cars.
From my personal experience of 2018-2019, the very long lights for cars and the fact they also have to wait if they miss it means the very often go on the red light. Wait time for cyclists often was over 2:00 (because ppl didn't press the button, because of their incorrect position) leading to strong civil disobedience from cyclists.
Honestly, I don't know why it's not a 3-way stop + seperate raised cycle lane w/ priority to cyclists and pedestrians, it's the best time to change now, and something tells me the next municipal administration won't be as bike friendly. But then again, I'm not a civil engineer, only a well informed road user who likes to read about norms and has access to Quebec's road publications.

The observatory on Mount-Royal, with my phone.
Tr's belle photo. On peux voir le M√©dical building (celui en cercle) donc c'est la prise de vue normal je crois dont on a l'habitude de voir. Je paris cette photo prise just devant le chalet. Mais si vous aimeriez conna√Ætre un endroit id√©al mal-connue: >>Vous connaissez les fameux escaliers de la Montagne? > Ceux qui m√®ne direct au chalet. Rendu en haut de ces escaliers il y a une d√©viation vers la droite. (un petit sentier). Donc au lieux de continuer tout droit vous prenez cette droite et environs quelques dizaines de m√®tres seulement plus loin il y a une cloture a droite. (Le soir) cette vue est cette angle spectaculaire comme nul part ailleurs. De ce angle nous pouvons inclure la stade de football dans le cadre.  Je l'ai d√©couvert par pur hazard un soir.

Although I understand the idea behind the lawsuit, they sadly already came forward with documentation proving that it's not a prohibited move...
Here's to hoping this kicks a policy change in motion.
ETA: After reading a surprising amount of legalese down there, I understand that the officer here is not necessarily at fault. What I do find worrisome or rather problematic is that while this particular officer might have done it correctly, or according to the book, another one might kill someone and end up saying "Book says it's okay".
I'd have loved to see the video leading up to this. A work colleague and I were once assaulted completely unprovoked by a gang of kids while walking to the metro after a hockey game. These gangs are merciless and violent and even though they were young I would not have felt bad if cops appeared to protect us using any force necessary - the fear of assault is intense and I wish it on no one. Luckily the ones that attacked us had no weapons but this kid did. So when I see this footage and the implication that we should be outraged, yeah, ok, I'm outraged that parents are letting their kids go around assaulting people and concealing weapons.
The media needs to stop playing the race & age cards to justify a criminal's right to crime. While I am no fan of cops, in this case he did what he felt was necessary (and within his training) in a very difficult situation with a violent, armed person.
The article doesn‚Äôt mention what the teenager was being arrested for. If they stole a chocolate bar from the local dep, this would be excessive force, but if they were threatening people with a weapon this would be appropriate.
I find it suspicious that the media focuses on the race aspect and not the context of the arrest‚Ä¶
Why kids are carrying stun guns in the first place?
Aren't they the ones who start carrying guns in future in absence of any order?
Would this lawsuit occur if
- The George Floyd had not made international headlines
- if the teen was not black
Because if the answer is no for both, then we're probably looking at more of an illegitimate lawsuit, and more of a case on whether the knee-neck hold policy should be reviewed.  Imho. 
Of course not many specifics on the case are being presented here. So my opinion could change.

If this was a white 14 year old girl with a stun gun in her bag would you jump to saying she's a violent teen in a gang? How about pepper spray, a knife (also illegal)? I'm a white woman and the answer is no. We have no idea yet why he had it, and two wrongs don't make a right. Hell I'd give my 14 year old son some way to protect himself if we lived in a bad neighborhood.
Unfortunately in our world race, gender does matter when considering your predisposition to danger, discrimination, and a lot of other bad things. 
Just heated because it's wild to me how y'all jump to defending the cops while not at least waiting to hear what happened. It's just a wall of skepticism and defensiveness, and not the healthy kind of skepticism.
It began with Gerard Tremblay's anti-fighting municipal bylaw from 2011... it eliminates the requirement to prove lack of consent. Also, cops think it's easier to apply municipal bylaws against children... who are NOT taught Moore v the Queen, nor are they taught about s, 74 CPP... and I also reckon that they trawled a whole area and presumed "reasonable and probable grounds" against people fitting a profile in a given area, not having seen the brawl themselves. The issue is passing these new municipal bylaws that reduce the threshold of intervention especially against children who NORMALLY are not subject to the penal-criminal system. The ticket under Tremblay's 2011 bylaw start at $500!
Aw shit, here we go again
Cops are supposed to be public servants, not public executioners.
But that's precisely what we expect of police. We expect them to have discretionary powers on their scenes.
Body cam video showed that Derrick Chauvin was kneeling mostly on George Floyd's shoulder blade, which is standard police procedure.  Maybe this was also the case here. We should wait until all the facts come out before we judge this situation.
for the Floyd family, the city of Minneapolis settled for $USD 27 Million.
this one from city of Montreal should be in the same range settled.
They're allowed to shoot people too but it's situational. Two officers vs a cuffed 14 year old may not require such a technique.
The only policy change wanted would be more training really. Banning this teching just makes people fall back on actually dangerous techniques.
> Here's to hoping this kicks a policy change in motion.
Yeah, either it's not proper procedure and they need to be disciplined, or it is proper procedure and we need to change the procedure. Either way, hopefully something changes (though not holding my breath obviously).
The question is not whether it is a "prohibited move", it is whether it is reasonable given the circumstances, the cops have not the right to make law and decide that it's OK... It is NOT reasonable unless the judge is a nasty police state type who think they can do anything they please. The reasonable person of the test knows about George Floyd.
I think you can sue them for having an unsafe book then.
I believe the police when they say they tried to serve a 2011-vintage $500 Gerard Tremblay anti-fighting bylaw ticket and the kids, not knowing Moore v the Queen and s. 74 Code of Penal Procedure, refused to cooperate in the service of said ticket by refusing to ID selves. I suspect that they were never actually seen fighting, but that the cops claimed "reasonable and probable grounds" that those kids were involved in the brawl...
I‚Äôm sorry you went through that awful experience. I disagree that violence should be responded to with unnecessarily lethal violence. We have gotten used to police being the only mode of intervention in these cases but it doesn‚Äôt need to be this way. I agree that we need to also prevent people from becoming violent in the first place, but that involves more supports towards social work, early intervention, wealth equality, and preventing discrimination.
hey, maybe if police actually punished the "few bad apples", then we wouldn't keep jumping to conclusions every time a cop does something.
Remember when 728 was fired for misconduct? LOL
> A work colleague and I were once assaulted completely unprovoked by a gang of kids 
Sorry you had a bad experience with some young people once, but it's not exactly relevant to the conversation. 
> The media needs to stop playing the race & age cards to justify a criminal's right to crime.
There's a broader conversation happening right now about police tactics (especially when dealing with minority communities). Minimizing that by talking baselessly about "media playing race cards" is wrong and bad.
>The article doesn‚Äôt mention what the teenager was being arrested for. 
L'article dit clairement pourquoi il a √©t√© arret√©... 
>Montreal police noted officers were responding to a call from Georges-Vanier high school about a fight involving more than a dozen young people from various schools.  
They claim the 14-year-old in the now-viral video resisted being searched, and pushed an officer away. Police found a stun gun in his bag.
The cops say he was arrested under s. 74 Code of Penal Procedure (and possibly Moore v the Queen 1978)... for refusing to cooperate in the service of a $500 Gerard Tremblay anti-fighting ticket, a bylaw adopted in 2011.
No it wouldn‚Äôt. If someone is subdued why would it matter the crime? Police are not judge jury and executioner. You can‚Äôt kill do tamale thing that could kill someone, regardless of what was being done prior.
The media doesn't care about that fact. They just want to rile us up and pretend that an innocent kid was being hurt for no reason. This is not even a race issue - it's a mix of poor police training and an increase in violent crime. The two don't mix. The criminal absolutely needs to be taken down, but the police require better training. Screw all this crap about our kids not being safe. Safe to do what, assault other people's kids?
I think the issue is the perception that cops are harder on black kids misbehaving than white kids misbehaving.
The stun gun issue is irrelevant since the pigs did not know of such a thing when they decided to arrest. Remember, we must not use 20-20 hindsight! Had the kids been properly taught Moore v the Queen and s. 74 CPP they would have given their names for the $500 Gerard Tremblay anti-fighting bylaw tickets and no one would have been wise to any stun gun or what not... that they were trying to engage the criminal justice system based on a 2011 invention to 14 year olds is very questionable let me say...
Careful about using that logic and assuming cops only use physical force and violence when necessary and in a controlled manner.
That‚Äôs such BS. It‚Äôs called excessive force for a reason. Plenty of people have been killed without resisting, but officers just pretend they are.
The stun gun is irrelevant since they did not know about it until after the arrest and decision to use this force. Remember, when it comes to police, no 20-20 hindsight!
Its crazy how political outrage can get you money for no valid reason.
It's all about what a "reasonable" officer would do. If they're trained to shoot at random when they hear a noise, it's "reasonable". If they're trained to kneel on necks of 8 y/o, it's "reasonable".
Since they're not well trained on de-escalation but are very well trained on violently apprehending persons of interest, it's no wonder that "reasonable" officers "accidentally" kill so many people.
What I keep seeing again and again is officers who seem incapable of physically restraining  suspects in a safe manner.   
This unfortunately leads to death and injuries because those officers are compensating for their incompetence and weakness with their firearms and dangerous techniques.
But... This technique could be dangerous if not properly executed, correct? It's taken lives already.
the procedure is irrelevant...to make it about the procedure is to give the police law-making powers... it's about the reasonableness of the force as determined by a trier of fact applying the correct law.
That is why I said "within his training". I don't think the training is correct and I even said I'm not a fan of cops. However, given the situation and given the training they have this cop likely did his best against a violent, armed perpetrator. 
It's also worth noting that the perpetrator wasn't actually harmed unless info is missing from the story, so why are you calling this "lethal violence"? He was pinned for a moment while being arrested, not being lethally harmed.
> I disagree that violence should be responded to with unnecessarily lethal violence.
And you clearly had it easier than others in life. Like it or not, but at times, violence is necessary.
The manoeuver in the video is one of the, if not the safest available. Its either that or they eventually end up having to use lethal stuff.
So if I understand correctly we should pretend these are good, innocent kids and this case is something it is not because it serves as retaliation against the Police? Also, I see that the Mayor got involved and the charges were not laid (WTF). So when these kids hurt their next victim how will their victim's families be expected to react? Is an innocent person's suffering justifiable because "cOpS uR bAd An We NeEd ReVeNgE"? This is insanity.
The media did immediately play the race card and blame the cop's action on his race, not his crime which is incorrect. You're the one minimizing his actions. I'm not minimizing other events; I'm saying this event is it's own thing and this cop would have likely restrained any age or race this way.
Also, how is youth gang violence not relevant to the discussion? It's like you intentionally want to leave the context of the situation out of the discussion because examining the details of the crime doesn't suit your narrative.
How should police tactics matter when dealing with minority and non minority? Sounds like something a racist would say.
I missed that, thank you for highlighting it. Now I would be curious how many officers were sent to sort the situation out and whether it was enough to get the situation under control quickly.
If someone was acting violent and brandishing a weapon, the risk of them suddenly attempting to make another violent, unpredictable move is totally different that someone who was calm and non-violent the whole time?
Exactly. Sadly, media wants to sensationalize every issue. Police brutality is trending these days, so it's time for them to make quick bucks. 
But I think having a weapon and then denying to obey (pushes officer) for search calls for such an action.
I am not a police fanboy but CMON, how far is too far? Where is the line drawn...
The stun gun is irrelevant. They did not know of it when they decided to arrest nor when they decided to use this excessive force. Remember, NO 20-20 HINDSIGHT!!!!  NOT WITH THE POLICE!
Let's leave black vs white for a minute. 
How many times have you seen brown skin or an asian in this similar situation?
I mean, they were and still get discriminated against but if you don't carry a WEAPON, you don't get kneed down. Period.
Unfortunately none of us can know what is and is not true. Do cops actually harm innocent blacks more than innocent whites? Who knows for real, but headlines and stories like the one above don't give me any confidence that the media will tell us the truth.
One thing is certain - a gang member with a stun gun is not your average black person who is unjustly targeted; he's a criminal who had to be arrested regardless of his color or age and who in this case was arrested using the current standard procedure and nothing more. 
Race and the safety of our children from police shouldn't even have been mentioned in the article because he wasn't arrested /excessively harmed due to race and this situation isn't in any way an example of a good kid being targeted.
The most concerning issues are 1) somehow 14 year olds can now easily obtain stun guns and 2) Cops are still no being trained on better methods of apprehending criminals.
I reckon that had they been white they would not have tried to serve them $500 Gerard Tremblay anti-fighting bylaw tickets circa 2011... I have been in municipal court and have seen evidence that they spare the whites and hit the non-whites with this...
Don't worry. Legault will completely ignore their recommendations and then blame us for having 9pm orgies/not following his recommendations.
We didnt loosen the restrictions because everything is going so great that we don't need them; we loosened restrictions because a large swatch of society are fed up, pissed off, at best passively non-compliant, and at worse have completely dropped out of the program when it comes to not spreading covid. The government had the choice of either reducing restrictions, or risking a rupture. These experts need to recognize there are more lanes than just the one they are in; every restriction costs political capital, and sustaining it gets more expensive with each passing day.

Imagine where we would be now if they didn‚Äôt open schools in the fall.... also again why tf were masks not always mandatory in schools for all ages? Young kids can contract and spread the virus, so why do we exclude them?
Has anyone seen any mention of when teachers will be vaccinated? Why for love of god are they not vaccinating teachers? Retired people fully able to stay isolated at home and with few underlying health conditions are being vaccinated. Meanwhile my friends and colleagues with diabetes, high blood pressure, various degrees of asthma, cancer survivors are trapped in closed rooms for hours on end with 100s of kids and I‚Äôm not even seeing it brought up anywhere. Are they just waiting for them to start dying?
Si la nouvelle variante affecte les plus jeunes et rend les gens plus malade, √ßa va √™tre pire que le printemps pass√©.  Les travailleurs dans les magasins vont tomber malade, les gens sur la construction...
si il resserre le couvre feu sans fermer les √©coles pis les √©glises je p√®te une coche
If you look at data, that is well known since the second wave started exactly when schools reopened in September last year. 
Everything was open with restrictions throughout summer with no surge of infections. Schools reopened and then we have this never ending 2nd wave leading to a 3rd without even finishing the 2nd.
Meanwhile Legault hides behind this smoke screen blaming the variants and people ‚Äúnot respecting‚Äù.
Shrug
Yeah, we never learn that prevention is less costly.
Je vais r√©p√©ter ce que j'ai dit √† ce sujet sur r/Quebec:
Le "collectif" est un projet de vanit√© de Marie-Michelle Bellon, compos√© de elle et ses amis, peu importe leurs comp√©tences.
Ils nomment 12 membres et 12 collaborateurs sur leur site web. [Voici la liste](https://i.imgur.com/aYmqadU.png) (format image).
On compte 2 √©pid√©miologues, dont Nima Machouf, la femme de Amir Khadir, qui fait partie du groupe aussi. Ce qui est le m√™me nombre d'ophtalmologistes (2), ils ont aussi une math√©maticienne, un ing√©nieur, un dermatologue. 3 sp√©cialistes en m√©decine interne ou d'urgence, incluant Marie-Michelle Bellon, et les trois travaillent √† l'h√¥pital Notre-Dame, bref elle a entra√Æn√© deux de ses coll√®gues de travail dans sa patente. Alors parler d'eux comme d'un groupe de savants et d'experts en la mati√®re est ridicule.
Ce qu'ils demandent est absurde.
Ils demandent de ramener le couvre-feu √† 20h pour √©viter le sort de la France... Or, la France a un couvre-feu √† 18 heures depuis des semaines et √ßa fait carr√©ment RIEN visiblement! Bref, la mesure a d√©j√† fait preuve de son inutilit√© pour emp√™cher une troisi√®me vague!
La refermeture des commerces "non-essentiels", alors que la r√©ouverture n'a eu AUCUN EFFET √† la hausse sur le taux de reproduction de la maladie en f√©vrier!
Bref, ils demandent des mesures que l'on sait inutiles. Marie-Michelle Bellon est juste quelqu'un en qu√™te de son 15 minutes de gloire √† la t√©l√© qui envie Arruda. C'est tout. C'est juste honteux de voir Radio-Canada pousser ce "collectif".
Close the fucking schools
On est en couvre feu depuis 3 mois d√©j√†, tabarnak, pis confinement 2 mois de plus que √ßa. Rendu ici, donne moi mon putain de vaccin, ou laisse moi passer l'ostie de grippe pis qu'on passe √† autre chose.
You know what could possibly silence these doctors...if the Quebec government published the model and data they are using to make all these 'decisions'.  I can't believe that we are a year past the pandemic and not a single governing body has created a decision model.  Hire a economist for Christ sake.
Hospital occupancy, mortality, R0, the weather, just use something to tell us how you are making any decision at this point.  I'm fine with you making it up, I just need to know that our leaders understand that to make decisions you need actual science.  Does anyone know how much a Canadian life is worth to the government?
My concern is not for today, next week, or even next year... what about 10 years from now? 20? 30? 
There is already some evidence that covid may cause permanent damage, and it attacks both the respiratory and circulatory systems. To force people to send their kids to school and risk getting something like that... it's unconscionable negligence of the highest order. Our health care system is having trouble handling things now... imagine what it will be like if all those infected people develop chronic Illnesses as a result? Imagine being one of those kids, growing up knowing you may very well have 10-20 years shaved off your life, and it could have easily been COMPLETELY AVOIDED. We may very well have an entire generation with serious long-term health problems.
This past year has been a literal "your money or your life" situation, and our government has clearly chosen the money. Only, it's not their cushy lives being put at risk, it's ours. Those old fucks will be dead by the time the fallout hits, and nobody will answer for it.

Les ecoles c'est ridicule d'un point de vue sanitaire.
On a heberge un neuveu, 12 ans, pour quelques jours. Pour un couple qui d'habitude vit seul et est precautionneux avec le covid, on s'est mis en quarantaine! Passer de la vie normale a avoir un kid qui va a l'ecole, meme si il est aussi precautionneux, oublie la distanciation sociale a la maison, et il vient de passer la journee a l'ecole avec des centaines d'autres kids. 
Fucking cesspool.
D'un point de vue "vraie vie", je comprend qu'ils puissent pas grader ca ferme.
Montr√©al est encore assez stable et je peux comprendre qu'il n'en faut que peu pour que le feu prenne. Mais il doit y avoir d'autres fa√ßons.
Qu'avons-nous appris de Qu√©bec et Gatineau? Est-ce les gyms? les restaurants? Les √©coles? Ce serait bizarre que ce soit principalement les rassemblements priv√©s alors qu'il y a plusieurs rel√¢chements qu'on savait risqu√©.
Reddit quand il y a 600 cas par jour depuis des semaines : Legault est un dictateur qui fait un power trip, la sant√© mentale c‚Äôest important, laissez-nous vivre. 
Reddit quand il y a 1300 cas par jour depuis quelques jours : Legault n‚Äô√©coute jamais la sant√© publique et devrait reconfiner.
Oh well.
My sister-in-law‚Äòs school has had a huge number of letters about positive cases. And it‚Äôs not a big school. My kids school has had a drastic increase as well, not as bad as other schools but it went from once or twice a month to three times a week.
Idk why they keep re-opening school when its school that are the biggest vector of passing covid, since kids dont know how to follow instructions.

d√©sol√© la gang mais rendu l√† jmen calisse pomal ¬Ø\_( „ÉÑ)_/¬Ø   cest un groupe de [ 12 docteurs random](https://m.imgur.com/aYmqadU) en fait c'est m√™me pas tous des docteurs ...
Qu'ils mangent d'la marde.
Montreal is actually super stable compared to most other regions who are exploding with cases now.  
As of yesterday, 245 out of the 487 hospitalizions were in Montreal. We had 3318 active cases for a city of almost 2 million people. 22% of Montrealers have gotten their first dose, which is set to increase even more as we can finally ramp up the process a bit. There is also "natural" immunity that people have after getting the virus, which science now says can last at least 6 months. About 8% of Montrealers had COVID, plus the 22% with the vaccine means almost 1/3 people have some protection again the virus.  
I am NOT a doctor/scientist, so this is just based on some research I have done and some obseservations, but I think Montreal might not get hit too hard by the 3rd wave compared to other places with less collective immunity.
Here we have a perfect recipe for cultivating vaccine resistant variants down the line.  Vaccinating a fraction of the population with a single dose while variants spread in the general population. A certain number of the single dose vacinees will be infected and the strains which perform better in vaccinated people will be selected. Not blaming, just saying.
The other day I went to a mechanic.. not a single guy in the shop wearing a mask. The front counter guy had a mask hanging off his ear.
I‚Äôd bet a large sum it‚Äôs like this all over. People just don‚Äôt give a fuck anymore.
Legault and his crew are impotent, they either stand to make too much off the bribes or owe too much to the wrong people ‚Äî and they‚Äôll never close manufacturing, warehousing or construction. 
Vaccines are the only hope, that and the fact these fucktards know that 8pm curfew in the summer means actual riots.
Et donc ont laisse tomber les vaccination? Je pensais que les gens de 65+ qu‚Äôils veuillent √™tre vaccin√©s sont vaccin√©s pour l‚Äôinstant? Pour quoi faire des pas en recule? Nous avons √©t√© promis des r√©ouvertures apr√®s la campagne de vaccination. Si la campagne de vaccination n‚Äôest pas un succ√®s va falloir r√©ouvrir peu importe et apprendre √† vivre avec le virus. Moi je me demanderai pas si il y a des m√©decins/experts qui n‚Äôont pas d‚Äôint√©r√™t sp√©cial avec des compagnies pharmaceutiques quand ils prennent leurs d√©cisions et √©crivent aux m√©dias.

Le probl√®me d'origine vient de la pollution, la pauvret√© et la sur-population.
Rien de ca n'est r√©gl√©.
I would think the fastest way to stop all of this is to speed up the vaccine rollout. I would go get the vaccine today if I could. Why are we waiting on old people to get their acts together? Open it up to everyone so we can all stop spreading it!
Now that Trump is gone we can finally see our leaders for what they really are: only good in contrast.
This is what half measures get you.
No way I trusted those fools. I kept my kids home and didn‚Äôt send them back in September. They weren‚Äôt requiring masks at elementary schools back then, no changes in ventilation, and worst of all they weren‚Äôt even doing forehead temperature checks!
They won't close the schools because people can apply for CRCB and stop working.
Mais √ßa monte m√™me pas √† Montr√©al????
My mother is a hairdresser. She has to work in close proximity to others. I wish they would close hair salons, because i think i might lose my mom to this bs virus and people thinking getting a haircut is more important than my mom's life. I feel like she is ignored by the government.
Close the damn schools.
I understand that there‚Äôs people who don‚Äôt have many other options for day time childcare (single parent working an essential type job who can‚Äôt afford a sitter, etc) and that kids should have a ‚Äònormalcy‚Äô but the longer this goes on, the worse it‚Äôs going to be for everyone - kids included.
Close the schools, close the goddamn gyms and churches. Why would a church need to be open (except for taking in donations ü§ë) - do people think god won‚Äôt hear them at home?
No don't close the schools... You can work if you have a bunch a little children running in the house. Older kids fine, like universities but not elementary schools.
Oh and fuck religion, if your god is so great he doesn't need you to pray to him at a specific place.

C‚Äôest vraiment la seule solution ? Pourquoi ne pas fermer toutes les lignes a√©riennes ? Plus d‚Äôh√¥pitaux , de personnel soignant, centre de d√©pistage rapide par  quartier etc. Pis fermer les parcs √† 6:00pm √ßa emp√™chera les gens de se rassembler. D‚Äôautres id√©es ?
At this point in the pandemic, it has become abundantly clear that no one actually understands how this virus works and whether the actions taken by government will have an intended effect, no effect, or the opposite effect. We're wrong just as often as we're right, which is a strong indicator that what's currently masquerading as science is largely just a randomness of outcomes. We still have a curfew. That seems to have largely worked. So why do we insist on repeating the actions that _haven't_ worked?
So true it hurts. He'll blame anything but their shitty decision making process. There was a teacher at the radio the other day who was saying schools learn the  decisions at the same time as everyone else then get no directives or help whatsoever into implementing them. I almost crapped my pants when I heard the education minister say every child has now access to distance learning. Its ridiculous and then they wonder why the population doesn't follow. Quebecers are Gros bon sens people and not "docile" like Mme Guilbeault would like us to be.
CAQ already came out and say they will force schools to open and they dont have a choice! And now that they know they are screwing up - they are focusing on identity politics and cancel culture to distract us.
Hahaha!!! That‚Äôs oddly.... specific! ü§£
> and then blame us for having 9pm orgies
Hey if you wanna get fucked just do your taxes üòÇ We all got the bulk of our support from Ottawa but it's Quebec that charges us nearly twice in taxes. I don't mind paying taxes on cerb, I knew and planned for it. But I don't see why Quebec should make a dime off that when they're the ones driving my industry to bankruptcy by opening and closing restaurants two, three times. I never took a vacation at either of my jobs and I'm starting to think I'll never see my 4%. Someone tell me at least that the loss of my vacation/severance is tax deductible.

He makes all the mess around him, he talks so much about himself. He enjoys talking about the good money he did in the private, and how happy he was making that money. His pubs have the huge face of him calling him passionate, competent and so on. Then he complains that people are too focused on him and not on his plans about the city. When asked about such plans, he brings nothing. Go figure.

"L‚Äôex-maire a dit avoir gagn√© annuellement ¬´ au moins deux fois plus ¬ª que le salaire du maire de Montr√©al (qui √©tait d‚Äôenviron 198 000 $ en 2020). ¬´ J‚Äôai fait pas mal d‚Äôargent. J‚Äô√©tais content ¬ª, a dit Denis Coderre. ¬´ Donc, je vous confirme que je ne reviens pas [en politique] pour une question d‚Äôargent, je reviens parce que j‚Äôaime Montr√©al. ¬ª "
Non mon Denis, c'est le pouvoir que tu aimes.
Pft, √ßa sonne vraiment plus comme Coderre qui a essay√© de faire leaker √ßa par le pdg. Je veux dire les 2 seules quotes du mec dans l'article c'est du love d'expectation de retour d'ascenseur pour D√©nis.
I'm a supporter of Projet Montr√©al, and not surprised at all about this news. What I find odd is why this CEO would share this information, wouldn't he want Coderre to win? Doesn't he know this will probably help Plante? Seems to me, he probably wants Plante to win. So maybe Coderre isn't the only one making deals with his company?
"Dans les six derniers mois de 2020 seulement, elle a lanc√© sept chantiers d‚Äôune valeur totale d‚Äôun demi-milliard de dollars, rapportait¬†La¬†Presse¬†√† ce moment."
He probably thinks PM will win and wanted them to be nice to him.
La question se pose donc: avec quelles autres compagnies n'a-t-il pas sign√© d'ententes de confidentialit√© finalement? Cogir ne sont s√ªrement pas les seuls! Soit Coderre va devoir les nommer, ou eux-m√™mes risquent de le faire d'ici la fin de semaine
Who do you think his hidden "consulting clients" are?  Why do they deserve so much privacy?  It's so that we don't see -  he got rich by showing contractors how to get $$ from The City of Montreal...that's what he's been up to.  Now he wants to slide back in as Mayor. Awkward....

God Que je le d√©teste cet homme je veux pas qu‚Äôil remette ses pattes sales sur la mairie de ma ville. Il est un gros opportuniste avide de pouvoir je peux pas croire que ses √©lecteurs semblent avoir oubli√© comment il a massacr√© le parc Jean Drapeau et ses mensonges par rapport √† la formule E !! Pour vrai son manque de transparence et son attitude de asshole confiant je peux pas croire qu‚Äôil ait la moindre chance de se faire r√©√©lire
Les pistes gotta go tho.
Assez dr√¥le, moins d'une semaine avant les √©lections et on sort des nouvelles comme √ßa. Comment telle ou telle personne a √©t√© r√©mun√©r√© importe en rien par rapport √† sa capacit√© de g√©rer une ville. 
Finit avec l'administration plante, temps de refixer la ville de Mtl. J'aimerais bien que pour une fois les gens votent pour qui va mettre de l'ordre et qui sait g√©rer. 
Coups tr√®s bas avant les votes, mais Plante perdra quand m√™me.
C‚Äôest un calcul. Cogir va devoir travailler avec l‚Äôadministration Plante.
Croire que Cogir a relev√© ces infos pas soucis d'int√©grit√© est na√Øf. Ils ont fait le choix de dumper Coderre pour Plante. √âquipe Plante a certainement fait de promesses, ou tenue ses promesses envers Cogir. Comme l'articles d√©voile 2020 $500M a Montreal.
C'est tous des crosseurs et enculateurs masqu√©s. C'est pas plus compliqu√©es que √ßa.
10$ que sa r√©plique va √™tre dans le genre de "les ententes de confidentialit√© sont avec d'autres organismes"
Juste sa r√©action √† l‚Äôhistoire du cellulaire: d√©ni et mensonges au lieu de juste admettre son erreur.
Si Coderre √©tait nettement devant Plante, cette histoire ne serait pas importante et Cogir n'aurait jamais confirmer. Cogir d√©voile ces fait parce-qu'ils savent que Coderre est dans la merde d√©j√†. Et... Attention, grosse all√©gations... Mais c'est bien-s√ªr que la campagne Plante a fait des promesse a Cogir afin qu'il communique cette info.
Son candidat √† la mairie de verdun a frauder ses clients afin de revendre leurs propri√©t√©s 2x plus ch√®re et dit que c‚Äôest un coup de chance.
Coderre n‚Äôy voit aucun probl√®me‚Ä¶
Le chat a seulement sortit une patte du sac, on ne sait pas avec qui ses autres contrats √©taient.

C'√©tait la m√™me chose dans le temps quand des politiciens voulaient cacher qu'ils avaient fum√© du pot √† l'universit√©.

He might also think that being associated with Coderre will be bad for his brand, so he prefers to dump the info right now, when he controls the message and can look like the good guy.
He probably thinks that Plante will win regardless so he wants to distance himself from the loser.
It's very possible that one of the reasons Cogir did that was to stay in Projet Montr√©al's good books ($$$)
> Who do you think his hidden "consulting clients" are?
Most likely Evenko and Groupe CH.

seriously?
ts√©, s'il y a plus de cones oranges en ville avec Projet Montr√©al, c'est parce que Denis lui avait la t√™te dans le sable face aux infrastructures d√©cr√©pites de la ville. Si tu veux qu'un viaduc te tombe √ßa t√™te, vote Coderre
Ils posent la question depuis d√©but septembre, un moment donn√© faut quand m√™me que linfo paraissent avant l'√©lection
https://twitter.com/RomainSchue/status/1454939048620052483?t=5OmABqZkX6q6KEho3BzQ2A&s=19
Cogir veut aussi surement se distancer un peu d'un candidat toxique et donc parler tout de suite des liens, plut√¥t que √ßa sorte apr√®s de fa√ßon moins contr√¥l√©e.
Pas fou!
> enculateurs masqu√©s
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Pas logique ton affaire, Cogir doit clairement pas √™tre fan du 20-20-20 de Plante. Je pense surtout que c'est l'affaire de la clause de confidentialit√© √©nonc√©e par Coderre (et fausse) qui les a agac√©. Le boss de Cogir voit bien que Coderre (re)devient tranquillement toxique aux yeux des gens et veut s'en dissocier.
> Ils ont fait le choix de dumper Coderre pour Plante.

C'est triste. Plein de souvenirs d'acheter des composantes quand j'apprenais √† construire des PC circa 2000... Au moins Canada Computers est encore l√† pour prendre la rel√®ve.
C'est normal, c'est une photo ou on voit leur stock de Ryzen 5000 et RTX ampere
Actually, I went to school with the owner and he's been pretty shady throughout the years.  I had to threaten to sue him several years back (20+ yrs) over an employee driving a cart into my car.  He was like not my problem initially.
His entire business model was obsolete anyway.  Hopefully his employees can find a place to work with a decent employer.
For some entertainment, you can go read the google reviews where customers shred him, and then he responds and comes off as a complete piece of shit.
Damn! Derni√®re fois que j‚Äô√©tais au centre ville pour le travail (pre-covid), c‚Äô√©tait toujours ouvert.
Je ne savais m√™me pas qu‚Äôil avait ferm√©.
Mais qui veut du MicroByte
c‚Äôest juste leur stockage de 3080
Another one BYTE the dust...
Sont pas juste vide de mem, y'ont pas l'air d'avoir de hardware pentoute.
Celui √† Rosem√®re a ferm√© aussi.
C√¥t√© prix ils √©taient pas proche de CanadaComputers et les autres donc √ßa me surprends pas trop.
Celui de St-L√©onard est ferm√© depuis quelques ann√©es d√©j√†. Toujours trouv√© louche qu'un commerce affiche publiquement qu'ils chargent 3% pour les paiements par cartes de cr√©dit. Compl√®tement ill√©gal de charger plus cher selon la fa√ßon de payer.

Quelqu‚Äôun souviens de Crazy Irving?
wow la demande en pandemie est vraiment ridicule
Il vont √™tre remplac√© pas GrosseBites bient√¥t, pour r√©affirmer le caract√®re de St Catherine.
I was always more of a Crazy Irving guy. The downtown MicroBytes was poorly laid out and uninviting IMO.
:( I remember buying my pentium 3 there back in 1999 with my dad, back when computer stores were a thing
There is GPCMICRO at St Leonard more than 20 years that Store is always a first hand service at to date for hardware and good prices too.
I used to work for the point-claire location. They‚Äôre incredibly cheap and the owner‚Äôs daughter was a little tyrant.
Order my custom pcs from this place, they did solid work and the prices were good. Shame to see it.
Wow you're right that is really sad. Bought my gaming laptop in college there 10 years ago! 
Not enough 3080s to go around :(
J'ai travaill√© au MB de laval a la fin des ann√©es 90 pendant 2-3 ans, peu apr√®s l'ouverture.
C'est des franchises, et je me souviens tr√®s bien du proprio qui √©tait bas√© a Pointe-Claire. A mon souvenir, il √©tait assez sp√©cial. Il rentrait dans notre magasin avec son air de mafioso et se donnait le droit de nous donner des ordres comme si c'√©tait notre boss. Le pire la dedans, c'est que notre g√©rant nous emp√®chait de prendre des pauses, de sortir fumer, de diner ou m√™me de lui adresser la parole en Francais pendant qu'il √©tait la, sous pr√©texte qu'il avait une aversion envers les "Slackers" et les "Frenchies" et se donnait le droit de sacrer n'importe qui dehors, au moment voulu.
Charmant personnage.
EDIT : Je viens de trouver un article qui parle de lui : [https://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2012/04/30/pres-de-740-000-damendes-pour-des-fraudes-fiscales](https://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2012/04/30/pres-de-740-000-damendes-pour-des-fraudes-fiscales)
C'est bel et bien de Morty que je parle, je ne me souvenais plus de son nom :)
Ah que de bons souvenirs chez Mycrobyte (pas celui l√†) Se faire crosser √† r√©p√©tition parce que j'√©tais trop jeune pour savoir √† quel point je me faisais crosser. Plus jamais.
Years ago when I bought my first state of the art PC in 97, with the help of my older cousin we went to the one in Saint-Hubert. When I came to pay, the bank had given me 4 crisp practically uncirculated $1,000 bills. The staff didn't believe they were real ... and holy crap did I ever have problems with that PC. They ended up having to rebuild it 3 times because they kept messing shit up. 2 fried power supplies (turns out they weren't the one I'd ordered and underpowered) and 1 motherboard later (no idea how they managed that), it was finally working.
Nevery really went back to them for some reason.
oh noe..
j'ai tellement achet√© d'affaire l√†..
Microbytes sucks, had to get my laptop fixed. took them 1.5 months to not fix the problem and some how break the keyboard and then charge me for it. bad quality service and glad i dont frequent their stores.
I bought my first Zoltrix 14.4kbps modem at MicroBytes in Pointe-Claire. Back then I was just a kid and the people there would treat me like shit. I swore I'd never go back, so instead I started to sell PC hardware myself.
F-U Microbytes! I'm still here and you're not! :) My sympathies to the employees who lost their jobs. That part does suck. 
(this is far cheaper than therapy...I'll move on now...)
Microbite.
W√¥, c'est la fin d'une longue histoire, l√†.
But I'll tell you something, I used to have to do late-night work at the Canix/Cologix data centre next door, and I saw some weird stuff happening in that MicroBytes at 1:30, 2 o'clock in the morning, multiple times.  Like dogs running around, people dressed like for a club, other stuff I can't remember anymore.
En tous cas !
Honestly, I go more to Canada Computer ever since they set up shop downtown. Microbytes feels like its been slowly degrading over the years.
Tant mieux. Les 3-4 fois ou j'y suis aller, ils etaient desagreables et pas professionnels du tout. Leur prix etaient bien au dessus des MSRP sans raison. Ils essayaient constamment de me refiler des composants plus cher que ceux que je demandais. Incapable de me donner d'alternatives raisonnable quand y avait pas de stock. Ils vont pas me manquer.
Y ont pas beaucoup de RTX 3000 √† vendre
The Chateauguay location meanwhile, branched out into used video games enough that they could afford drop their Micro-Bytes franchising. I think they're independent now. That location was always a black sheep, Not matching the aesthetic of the other stores, no uniforms, etc...
I never liked the staff or the layout but I have years of memories here. Makes sense though because if I'm going to a store with shitty service I might as well go to a bigger one with more shit like Canada computers or not have to leave my house via newegg or Amazon. Not sure what brick and mortar stores can really do to compete.
Very sad
They're closed?! I moved from mtl years ago....this hit me in the feels :(
Je fais 100% confiance a CIPC contrairement a CC. Avec les histoire du propri√©taire √©tant plus que louche...
SATA laiss√© des bons souvenirs
M√™me chose pour moi. J'avais achet√© une carte video NVIDIA TNT et un Pentium II usag√© d'un ami, et je suis all√© dans ce magasin Microbyte m√™me pour acheter le reste (motherboard, case, ram, hd etc). C‚Äô√©tait la premier fois que je montais un ordinateur. C‚Äô√©tait ma machine pour jouer √† Counter-Strike dans le temps que c‚Äô√©tait un mod pour Half Life.
F
On peut enfin voir irl les stocks de GPUs
what shopping cart would there be in the pointe claire location?
He was.
Bought my first computer from them long ago through a gov sponsorship program. They had glued a pentium 4 sticker on a pentium 3 cpu. I had my friends verify theirs, and it was the case for every single cpu we checked that came from them. I will be happy if they go out of business. They always been shady. Sucks for the employees that did not participate in the scams.
ahahah. Quand le g√©rant d√©cidait de se lever et ouvrir le magasin...
Same.  Min bureau est drette en face... Et je n'y suis pas all√© depuis un an.. ho well...
Pens√©e positive pour le le staff.
C'est l√† que je suis all√© pour avoir deux cables rj45 et une lesbienne rush quelques heures avant le confinement. Mon dernier achat "informatique" dans un magasin physique.
Ta blonde m'a jamais dit non.

Ceux qui sont pas capable d'avoir du KiloBytes
Covid got them under pressure
Beaucoup de gens se sont plaint de cette pratique. La fa√ßon dont le magasin s'en sort, c'est de dire qu'il y a un rabais de 3% si tu paies comptant, mais en payant par cr√©dit, tu "perds" ton rabais. Bien du monde ont port√© plainte √† l'OPC, mais sans succ√®s. Je le sais, car j'ai travaill√© au MicroBytes de St-L√©onard justement (avant et apr√®s que le magasin devienne une franchise).
Wow! I really like it. Do you sell and/or expose anywhere?
This is beautiful! I really like this "blurry" style. (it's not the right word for it I'm sure, I know nothing about painting...)
I remembered that I took [a picture of that same spot, in the snow](https://i.imgur.com/hizhRzc.jpg), almost exactly a year ago!
Pre-emptive note that I tried to submit earlier but my app was glitching - second time's the charm!
How long did it take you to learn to paint like that? It looks awesome! I‚Äôve been painting for some months now. I think my paintings are good, but they‚Äôre definitely not in this level!
Oh WOW......so beautiful!
Thanks! I sell online and have exhibited back in Vancouver (where I'm from) but not here, so far
Thanks! I don't know what I would call the style either, to be fair :)
Beautiful shot! I opted out of including the trees for fear they would turn out too blob-like.
Thank you! Hard to say... I'm self-taught but have been doing so my whole life. I can't remember a time I didn't paint. I focused on mastering realism first though, and have only been working my way out of that and trying other forms of expression that felt more 'me' in the last 4 years or so.
Thank you!
Amazing. Just saw your link on you profile, will check it out.
Nice. I really like your painting style. I hope I can paint as good as you some day (Btw sorry for the late response, I haven‚Äôt opened Reddit in a while üòÖ)
I would take a ‚ÄòFrench for business‚Äô class or just learn phrases that pertain to your line of work. Apologies in French might help if the customer is upset. Still, people tend to be jerks in general to service staff, and I‚Äôm really sorry you went through that.
C'est par l√†.
C'est yienk icitte
Hey there, French teacher here, if you need help for anything in French, write to me and I'll help you.
If you can't speak French well enough to do your job, yeah that's a problem. You're trying your best, I'm sure, but Montreal is still a mostly French city, and you need to be able to respond to customers in it. Not a great reason fo4 the customer to get actually upset at you, but still, if I were you, I'd consider taking some French lessons on the side. It's an effort you need to make for any kind of customer facing job in Quebec.
d√©sol√© je ne parle pas fran√ßais puis-je vous r√©pondre en anglais ?
That was my go-to when I was living in Montreal as a student
maybe a 'venez avec moi?' and bring her to them while you get accustomed to french?
It's not a question of the customer being right in this case; if someone goes off on you in Mandarin or German, it's not your obligation to be able to reply. French is, however, the official language of the Province and is absolutely a requirement if you are in a customer-facing role. 
In your case, since you are making an effort and learning French, I would have apologized and said "d√©sol√©, j'apprends le fran√ßais" before leading them to the desired item. If they still get upset at that point, they are an asshole (as you clearly are doing your best). For future interactions, if you are unsure, just say "venez avec moi" and then you show them. 
Don't let this get you down, and keep studying! You're doing good!
The situation sort of answers the question here.
Some people can't understand English and aren't really required to in Quebec.  Sure, life is easier when you're bilingual but unilingual francophone is acceptable in Quebec and they still deserve service.  The debate has always been the opposite side of the coin.
A few simple phrases will do the job.
While her reaction seems over the top to me, you really should be speaking to French speaking customers in French. 
But you say it was an accident so I imagine you normally do. You slipped up, it happens. I wouldn't worry too much about it.
>I understand the customer is always right in businesses
Not true. Customers can be assholes and a good business will stand up for the rights and dignity of its employees.
However in this case, yes, if you're working a customer service job and someone speaks to you in French in Quebec, you should always reply in French.
If I went to a paint store and asked if this paint was latex or oil based, and the employee said "huh? what's latex and oil?" I'd be annoyed. I'd be polite but I'd shake my head.
Similarly, if you work in Quebec in a customer service job, you are in my opinion pretty incompetent if you don't know the basic phrases like "it's over there". That's okay, but it sounds like you need to do a little bit of work to learn the basics. Shouldn't be too bad, lots of people in other countries know the basics of 8 languages to serve customers.
Simply put, it is the law in Quebec where if a customer asks to be served in French, the business must be able to accomodate them for it is the customer's right - in your situation, if there was someone else working with you who spoke French, you could've called on them to handle the customer and that would've been OK.
Most customers in the Greater Montreal area will not prevail themselves of this right and switch to English, some begrudgingly. Outside of the GMA though, a *lot* of customers will do so, either from lack of English or out of pride.
Fortunately the Quebec government has a pile of resources to help workers learn French. Check out the govt website!
add a "madame" at the end
when i waited tables and the customers were speaking to each other in english, i asked them a question in english and they gave me a stink eye then replied in french  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
The customer shouldn‚Äôt have gotten so mad over it, but I‚Äôd sure as hell be irritated because it is expected to get service in French in Qu√©bec. If you took a customer service job, you need to minimally know a few sentences in French and technically you should have functionnal French because there is a legal obligation to serve in French. I suggest you at least learn something along the lines of ¬´¬†Mon fran√ßais n‚Äôest pas tr√®s bon, est-ce que je peux vous l‚Äôexpliquer en anglais? ¬ª
As a French speaker, I give more importance to someone actually trying to speak French than the actual quality of it. If I see the person is struggling in French I switch to English or take a minute to teach the the right words (if the context is appropriate and the person seems disposed to learn).
All I can do is encourage you to practice and learn as much as you can! Immersion is the best way to learn quickly :)
Improve your french and try your best. To get to a level of french to handle basic customer service is pretty easy IMO, just practice everyday.
"The customer is always right" is an outdated view that lets customers feel justified to treat workers like shit.
She asked you a question and you did your best to answer her. Keep trying to improve your French but don't think that you did anything wrong.
IMO, customer in Quebec should expect and can be pissoff in not receiving services in French. Do they have to act like a jerk? No. 
It's like if you opened a store in Germany and you were questioning why your customer get pissoff when you answer them in French.
As a French Canadian speaking first in French in Montreal, the only thing I find insulting is when the person I speak with don‚Äôt acknowledge the fact they won‚Äôt be able to speak French to me. 
If I speak to them in French and they just reply in English just ignoring the fact I used another language, I will be bothered. Same goes the other way around.
If I speak to them in French and they start by saying something like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt speak French‚Äù, whether it‚Äôs in English or French, then I‚Äôm totally fine.
For me it‚Äôs just a respect thing.
I don't think it's disrespectful, but might I ask how come you don't know such basic words you could learn overnight as a retail employee in a French province?
I agree that customers should expect french in Quebec. I disagree with being disrespectful though.
I‚Äôd explain to the customer that I‚Äôm still learning French and not sure how to say that in French, then ask him how to. I think he‚Äôd be happy to tell you!
[deleted]
Drette l√† 
Juste l√† 
Mtl is still in QC so language of work is French...
Sa r√©action n'√©tait pas polie, aurait pu √™tre plus civique. √âvidemment, il va de soit que de travailler au service a la client√®le au Qu√©bec n√©cessite de ma√Ætriser le fran√ßais, puisque c'est la langue officielle ici. Souvent, des francophones peuvent vivre des frustrations lorsqu'ils doivent accommoder des employ√©s unilingues anglais, ce qui est un ph√©nom√®ne de plus en plus courant. Ce n'est pas d√©raisonnable de s'attendre √† un service en fran√ßais au Qu√©bec. C'est d√©raisonnable de ne pas √™tre courtois comme cette personne.
I‚Äôve generally found if you make the attempt (no matter how bad the attempt may turn out) it‚Äôs the fact that you tried that generally gets you a positive response from people. 
I doubt anyone will get mad at you if you have poor French as long as you try. If they do get mad at you then quite honestly these are probably the people who get upset at most things in life, and not worth you worrying about.
Edit: spelling
So you came to a French speaking part of the world, didn't invest much effort in learning it, and wondering if it's rude?
[deleted]
Just say "l√†-bas" and point at it.
Now you know.
I wouldn't be offended, but annoyed you didn't try, 'par l√†', 'par ici' or 'juste ici' are all fine answers
Woof. Working in customer service without confidence in your French is gonna be a hard time. Or, from the optimistic perspective, you're going to get good practice.
But, having lived here all my life, I can understand the customer feeling disrespected. The right to do business in their own language first and foremost is something that Quebecois had to fight for.
As a rule of thumb, you want to make a proper attempt at responding to a customer in French, no matter how low your confidence is.
Also, while a lot of younger people are *fine* with being spoken to with the "tu" pronoun, a lot of older people find it disrespectful. Generally in customer service you should use "vous" across the board. Incidentally, the act of using one or the other is called "tutoyer" or "vouvoyer". So you may occasionally be speaking to a customer with the "vous" form and they may tell you "tu peux me tutoyer" or "pas besoin de me vouvoyer". In other words, "you can go ahead and address me as 'tu'" or "no need to address me by 'vous'".
So let's go over some words you'll find yourself using in retail a lot:
You probably remember your french up/down/left/right well enough, but maybe not "straight ahead". That's "tout&#160;droit".
"follow me" = "suivez moi"
"i can show you" = je peux vous montrer
"this way" = "par i√ßi"
"that way" = "par l√†"
"down there" / "over there" = "l√† bas"
"at the bottom" / "at the end" = "au fond"
"above" = "au dessus de"
"below" = "en dessous de"
"across from" = "face √†" / "en face de"
"right beside" = "juste √† c√¥t√© de"
The various merchandise you work with should probably be pretty easy to figure out for yourself. One fascinating little one is "board games". In French, that's "jeux de soci√©t√©".
Not sure of how and why you were hired in the first place. Sorry but trying to learn French is not good enough. Fault is on the hiring manager.
Just imagine a clerk in downtown Toronto expecting to speak French to anglophone customers.  The entitlement of some anglos is astounding.
Just try and learn some phrases that are common in your work and if they don't understand,  smile and say, "D√©sol√©e, j'apprends le fran√ßais." I think saying you're learning, rather than you don't speak or don't know, is likely to disarm even people with a big language chip on their shoulder. 
Good on you for learning. It WILL pay off.
I‚Äôve seen signs on doors of small businesses saying ‚Äúj‚Äôapprends le fran√ßais‚Äù to sort of manage client expectations. And some basic course can go along way to show you appreciate the local culture and language. This being said, her reaction was a bit extreme imo
Thank you for learning French. No, I don't think it's impolite to speak English. You're in Canada. Like someone else said already, ‚ÄúD√©sol√©, je suis en train d‚Äôapprendre le fran√ßais.‚Äù will usually be enough get the person off you back, cause any French speaking person knows French is fucking hard. It will probably happen again, unfortunatly.
I'm a French local, btw.  I'm pissed and embarrassed that you were treated this way. Same thing happened to my old Australian roommate years ago, even though doing a French immersion program, she just forgot the word for "bag" once while working at a grocery store and offended some lady. The lady started talking behind her back in French. She ended up explaining herself in French, the lady apologized and said ''keep learning''. Some people are so quick to jump to conclusions and think that hearing a few English words in a thrift store justifies getting upset and being rude to others.
The amount of hatred spewed at the Quebecois in this thread is disgusting... Y'all need to get over yourselves, Quebec is different and it has that right.
The meaning of the aphorism ‚Äúthe customer is always right‚Äù has been perverted. It was originally a principle in the marketing business and ‚Äúthe customer‚Äù referred to the collective body of consumers, as in ‚Äúthe market‚Äù. It meant that to be successful selling a product you have to pay attention to the likes and dislikes of consumers as a whole. You can't sell a product that the consumer doesn't like. The saying does not mean that every snot-nosed Karen gets what ever she wants. Businesses need customers, but not bad customers. Your boss may disagree, though.
It's a touchy subject with a lot of french people. And a lot of English people too actually, the other way. I think mostly the more monolingual people that have lived here a long time that hate it.
For me, I understand both languages. So, I prefer that everyone expresses themselves in the language they're most comfortable with. And a lot of people are like me and don't care. 
But, speaking each your own language can be weird. People don't like that. So, they feel they need to pick a language, and by responding in english, you're sort of forcing them to do the same. 
I wouldn't care, and I don't think people should really care. 
But, people do, so, for me as a customer I don't care, I in fact prefer if french people working respond in french, and if they struggle at all with English, I'll mention it to them. 
But as an employee in customer service, you have to assume the customer will care, and provide them service in the language they choose. I do think it's a courtesy everyone should offer in any sort of role like that. 
Even though I don't really like anything about "customer is always right" and any shade of the idea like employees are paid to put up with bullshit. People should be kind to people because we are people. 
But you should still respond in the same language, imo. It's a courtesy to them.
You can't even say 3 words in the official language of the province. Enjoy getting fired
In a store, a costumer has the right to be served in French because of the law in Quebec.
I hate being served in English based on the way I look, or based on my name. I have heard terrible English accent by default from French speaking employees because of my appearence, which I find racist/unrespectful. But it is a specific situation. The law is the law, so people in general should expect to be served/helped in French by default in a store.
As someone who has too much experience in service based jobs, I'd say ignore it and move on. When customers freak out like that, it's because of something unrelated to you (usually they're having a bad day) and not because you made a mild mistake. In this case, i'm guessing it's because this customer has dealt with a lot of ignorant anglos (montreal seems to have a lot of them imo) before and sterotypes non-francophone speakers as being just as ignorant. 
Now, based on your comments, you're working to learn the language, you're not deliberately being a jerk just to prove some Anglo superiority or something. Just keep working on your language skills and don't worry about what customers do, or don't do. Some customers are just pricks, and some customers are going to be great. Who knows, maybe next time a polite customer will help you with some pointers about what to say if they catch you making a mistake in French and help you out. 
Just ignore the dickish customers and do your thing. You'll be fine.
Absolutely
The client sounds like a whiny bitch.
i say ‚Äúl√† bas‚Äù  LOL to point to an object  when asked for directions.
[removed]
The customer is not always right in business. This is how Karens were born.
It could also not be a language thing, in retail you're not supposed to just point and say "over there" because its poor customer service. Its better to say something like "I can show you where that is" and lead them to it. Then the usual ask if theres anything else they need help with. I can understand this may be more difficult for you because of the language but it is a more polite way to help customers
French is legally about to become the only mandatory language for work in a near future. I'd immerse myself in its universe if I were you.
Maybe a little, but it doesn't excuse being a dick to you. To them it seems like you understood, but just choose not to answer in French. It'd go a long way if you said sorry you're just learning French.
Some people can't/ won't speak English at all. So what you do when you're in trouble is you pull out your phone and open up Google translate.
Ma premi√®re semaine au Qu√©bec, je suis all√© dans un bureau du gouvernement provincial pour obtenir des documents, et une femme horrible m'a dit que si vous voulez parler anglais, d√©m√©nagez √† Toronto d'une mani√®re tr√®s condescendante.
Je lui ai expliqu√© qu'il m'√©tait impossible d'apprendre le fran√ßais en une semaine, mais elle √©tait trop b√™te pour comprendre.

Visuals and stats are pretty good, but the title is a bit misleading. I was expecting to see future projections given different scenarios over the holidays. Maybe something showing how the projections got worse as the situation evolved to explain why the plan needed to change.  
Instead, it boils down to "meetings are cancelled because Covid is bad" as an explanation in the first sentence, and then giving a bunch of stats to show how bad things are. It still makes the point but just not as well as it could have IMO.

C'est aussi parce qu'il essaie de perp√©tuer un air d'autorit√© et de bonne gestion face √† des statistiques qui parlent autrement. Il s√©lectionne avec soin les pires exemples de juridictions quand les journalistes lui demandent l√©gitimement pourquoi le Qu√©bec se comporte si mal dans sa r√©ponse compar√© √† ailleurs.

Je pense depuis le d√©but que les mesures de confinement doivent √™tre vues pour le long terme.

L'alberta ne compte pas ses morts comme le Qu√©bec. Le Qu√©bec compte tout ceux qui meurent d'une condition si elle a √©t√© aggrav√©e par le Covid, par exemple quelqu'un qui avait d√©j√† une maladie pulmonaire et dont le covid a empirer la condition. L'alberta ne compte comme morts du covid  que ceux qui n'avaient pas de conditions majeures avant et qui sont mort des seules complications de la covid, donc ceux qui √©taient d√©j√† en sant√©. 
La r√©alit√© est qu'il y a probablement beaucoup plus de gens qui sont mort parce que la covid a empirer leur condition en alberta. Probalement pas autant par habitant que au Qu√©bec o√π nos CHSLD ont √©t√© fortement touch√©s, mais quand m√™me pas mal plus.
> Notre province est trop occupee a investir des millions dans l'office de la langue francaise au lieu d'hopitaux et de fournir des salaires competitifs a nos experts de la sante.
L'OQLF avait un budget de 24 millions avant que le gouvernement en rajoute 5 cette ann√©e. Le minist√®re de la sant√© d√©pense 38.4 milliards de dollars par ann√©e.
Le budget de l'OQLF √† la taille d'une erreur d'arrondi du minist√®re de la sant√©.
Ce que tu viens d'√©crire est ridicule.
In reality we have far more cases, the deaths in Quebec came when we did far less testing (so less confirmed cases during the worst of our outbreak). Even with more testing now, we still miss most cases.
As an example, there are currently <100m confirmed cases in the world, yet the WHO estimated months ago that ~10% of the world had been infected.
Je doute que l'argent investit dans le fran√ßais soit moindre comparable √† la sant√©. C'est un argument qui ne fait aucun sens surtout que consid√©rant que la protection du fran√ßais a grandement am√©lior√© dans les 70 les conditions d'une classe peu ais√©e de la population. Consid√©rant que je me fais r√©pondre r√©guli√®rement juste en anglais dans des restaurants de Montr√©al, on a encore un bon bout de chemin √† faire. J'ai des amis qui ne parlent pas anglais et sont incapables d'obtenir un emploi √† cause de √ßa alors qu'ils ont immigr√©s ici √† cause du fran√ßais. Un peu dommage de croire que tu peux am√©liorer tes conditions de vie apr√®s v√©cu une guerre civile, trouver le cadavre de ton p√®re pour te ramasser presque dans la rue car tu ne parles pas anglais dans une province qui est officiellement francophone.
L'Alberta a demand√© de l'aide de l'arm√©e et de la crois rouge pour des h√¥pitaux de campagne. Pr√©sentement, ils sont pires que nous en terme de capacit√© d'h√¥pitaux.
Il faut consid√©rer que notre probl√®me est avant tout les CHSLD ce qui a fait mal aux statistiques. Ce n'est pas n√©cessaire une repr√©sentation de l'ensemble du Qu√©bec. Le transfert d'employ√©s a fait terriblement mal. Par contre, si on retire les morts en CHSLD dans la premi√®re vague, ils sont possiblement pire que nous d'autant plus qu'ils ne semblent m√™me pas les compter dans leurs statistiques car toutes personnes en CHSLD a de multiples autres conditions majeures. Au moins la seconde vague n'a pas aussi fait mal aux CHSLD.

Si tu penses que les faits sont importants en Alberta, tu ne portes pas attention.
>Si c'est vrai, pourquoi les journaux denoncent pas ca?
...C'est le cas pourtant.
I think it's pointless anyways. What will it change if Alberta is pointed as the most impacted province in Canada by medias? Experts know what's up and know how to interpret stats. That's the important part IMO.
C‚Äô√©tait la m√™me situation en Chine, ils ont fait ce qu‚Äôils pouvaient pour para√Ætre mieux. 
Mais encore plus au point, le concept du nombre de cas par r√©gion ne prend pas toujours en compte l‚Äôaugmentation du nombre de tests. Il serait important de dire que si on a par exemple 1500 nouveaux cas cette semaine mais qu‚Äôon a quadrupl√© le nombre de tests, il est fort probable qu‚Äôon avait tout simplement pas test√© tous les positifs la semaine d‚Äôavant.
 Le nombre de tests √©taient beaucoup plus √©lev√©s durant la deuxi√®me vague, je trouve qu‚Äôil serait important que on aie une statistique compl√©mentaire et ce serait simple √† afficher : 1500 (3.6%)
"Si c'est vrai, pourquoi les journaux denoncent pas ca?"
Peut-√™tre parce que, comme toi, the newspapers have other goats to scape?
You literally came out saying more deaths because OQLF.
You don't get to high-horse this one, sorry.

Le bilan du covid sera certainement la diff√©rence des morts avec la moyenne annuelle. On vas avoir une bonne id√©e rendu l√†
Verdun has gone through hell in terms of absolute gentrification. Entire neighborhoods are getting evicted and we've had a real estate agent for a mayor for nearly the entire process; with curious auditing infractions in his permits and inspections department. The same one supposed to be trusted with stopping unlawful or egregious abuses of renovictions.   
We can't strictly ban these people from running for office but public awareness about these incestuous and dangerous relationships would go a long way.
I‚Äôm sympathetic to the cause of addressing the housing crisis, but by this logic we should disqualify not only landlords, but anyone who owns property, since they stand to gain from rising housing prices.
I am totally in favor of making the economic declarations public so people can make informed choices when they vote.
So run against them. That's kinda how democracy works
To prevent them from running because of conflict of interest is a wrong approach.
This said, it would be interesting to have this information as a voter, especially if housing is an important issue for you. We can guess that big langlord (people with multiple housing complexes) are less interested in lowering prices than other candidates...
Also, I think we have to seperate owners of a duplex/triple that live in it and "professional landlords". In the former case, these people are just trying, like most of us, to own something in the city and are often more reasonable and care about their renters. In the latter case, they just care about money.
Yeah.. Landlords *for the people*.... yeaaaaah...... üò∂
Landlords are bad, tenants are good. Got it
Fuck landlords and their fucking rent-seeking cancerous greed draining society of the proceeds of real work. Their hoarding of property and land is the reason we have inequality. Nobody should be able to make a living contributing nothing to society running slums for the working class. Fuck landlords.
Obviously (as the expert quoted says) you can't ban landlords from running for office, but obviously we can make stronger rules around conflicts of interest in gov. Especially when touching on pretty critical issues of our time.
So I don't see why anyone would have a problem with detailed disclosures from any candidate running. 
Combine that with some recusation rules, and some major penalties for lying or misleading and you're getting somewhere close to a decently protected democracy.
No it's not. What a silly opinion.
Je trouve √ßa particulier comme article. Pr√©tendre qu'un propri√©taire ne devrait pas √™tre un repr√©sentant du peuple est un peu fort. Les propri√©taires, que l'on les aime ou pas, repr√©sentent un certain pourcentage de la population qui a tout √† fait le droit de se pr√©senter aux √©lections. Peu importe ton statu (locataire, propri√©taire, itin√©rant, etc.) tu as le droit de te pr√©senter...
Beaucoup de gens ne comprenne pas la limite du pouvoir municipal. Par exemple, le zonage g√®re un usage (r√©sidentiel) et non un mode de tenure (location, condominium, etc.). Cela fait en sorte que c'est facile de dire qu'un √©lu ne s'occupe pas de la gentrification ou encore qu'il la favorise, mais en r√©alit√© les leviers pour la contrer sont minimes.
Qu'est-ce qu'un √©lu municipal devrait faire? plus de ruelle verte ou d'op√©ration de verdissement parce que cela provoque de l'√©cogentrification. Plus d'ouverture √† de nouveaux usages (comme dans Verdun avec les bars) parce que cela attire des m√©chants gentrificateurs? Bref, j'aimerais que l'on m'explique ce que ces m√©chants √©lus propri√©taires devraient faire ou pas parce que je ne vois pas en quoi leur jugement est si affect√© sachant que le prix des loyers est fix√© par un organisme provincial, que l'objectif des pouvoirs municipaux est de cr√©er des milieux de vie de qualit√© et que finalement le pouvoir d'un √©lu municipal est somme tout restreint. Le milieu urbain est quelque chose qui √©volue en fonction de plusieurs facteurs.
Croteau est propri√©taire dans Rosemont. Est-ce un m√©chant qui ne veut pas de pauvre et qui fait des politiques pour sa gueule?
Fumagalli la mairesse de VSMPE est propri√©taire dans Parc-Ex. Est-ce une m√©chante capitaliste qui cherche √† tirer profit de sa position?
Je crois que la positiion de PM est probablement la plus balanc√© sur la question.
Fox in the hen house. Greedy immoral developers and real estate agents are the scourge of modern society.
So landlords can't run?
God forbid anyone who's invested in the community actually be elected to represent it. The majority of the people who live in Montreal will profit from an increase in property value, should they all avoid running for office?
Every business owner will also profit, I guess they shouldn't run either.
Hell, if business does well people who want jobs might get better ones, they should be banned too!
Give me. A fucking. Break.
I'm so ignorant on Montreal politics, just found out boroughs have their own mayor.
Are you talking about Jean-Fran√ßois Parenteau? If so, then this is the first time I've ever heard anyone describe him in such a negative light. He's been so responsive to the community and is generally extremely well liked, as far as I can tell. I know a lot of people were very disappointed when he announced that he wasn't running again this year. 
I think there are so many different election issues this year that it will be very interesting to see how things land, as it will depend on everyone's differing priorities.
I disagree with that I think we can absolutely ban these people from running. 
It‚Äôs not discriminatory it‚Äôs conflict of interest.
>but by this logic we should disqualify not only landlords, but anyone who owns property
I disagree, that would be undemocratic. Just as info about people running should be public knowledge. Their property holdings are relevant. Let anyone run, but just as a public company has open books so should the candidates.
No, single home owners own a home to live in.
Landlords own additional homes for profit. They have clear motives beyond single home owners.
They are absolutely not the same.
Someones private finances shouldn't be of anyone's business.
Easy to say but you need money to run, can't really run if you're working full time to make ends meet.
Easier to whine about it though!
I'm a landlord in that I own a duplex. Yeah, I stand to gain from the price run up, but until you have a second property it's a bit of a mirage. If I sell I still need somewhere to live, so I gotta buy at the inflated price with the insane no-inspection make an offer before visiting reality. That FUCKING SUCKS. I do not like this reality one bit. I don't want to be flooded with homeless people because there is nowhere affordable, i want my kids to be able to buy something someday, and I want to be able to buy something else someday without the ridiculous sheananigans that are ahappening right now. 
By all means, point out which candidate are landlords, and by how much. More transparency on this matter is absolutely legit. But to pretend that anyone who owns housing is in conflict of interest, like Amy Darwish claims in this article, is just stupid.
Adam Smith knew them as rentiers.
Neoliberals love Adam Smith yet totally fail to segregate and minimize rentier activity.
Found the angry renter...
>rent-seeking
Rent-Seeking was a term to criticize Feudal Landowners from using their land to physically tax the trade, as in setting up tolling booths by rivers to tax any merchant who sailed through "just because they can" and not because they're contributing anything.
If you're a Landlord, chances are you have to maintain your property and to provide housing for others; therefore the concept of rent-seeking in today's world and that of Adam Smith are completely different. Learn the context, read the book; it's not that hard.
>Je trouve √ßa particulier comme article. Pr√©tendre qu'un propri√©taire ne devrait pas √™tre un repr√©sentant du peuple est un peu fort
No one said that. But it land and property ownership of people running for public office should make be required to make their holdings public in the same spirit as the requirement for politicians to use a blind trust for their investments when they could pose a conflict of interest. Same goes for landlords who specifically aren't tenants.
Is that you got from the article?
If only. And we could so much more
Agreed, would make a difference from another politician through and through to have someone with a different background who is also a landlord
Some people on this subreddit don't see if that way. They rather everything be a slum...
>Give me. A fucking. Break.
Break given, as a city Landlord I actually have a vested interest in the success of this city. Like seriously, if I were to run for office and did a shit job running the economy, it would be MY property value that suffers, if you're a renter you can just pack your things and move to Toronto if shit hits the fan, but if I can't sell for a profit then it's my ass on the line.
These fucking renters want to run society without any vested economic interest in it, nobody's eager to spend their own money to help the poor but when it's the Landlord's tax dollars let's just blow it on social programs!!!
You've missed the point entirely! Congrats!
He's extremely well-liked by property owners and ladies who are into daddy types.   
But if you attend council meetings and keep up with the annual report of the Montreal Auditor, the guy's cute appearance and penchant for fibbing start to contrast.
Richard Antoine
I think we agree.  
I was saying that *by that logic* that's a consistent conclusion. I don't think we should disqualify either class of people, even if I wouldn't personally vote for big-time professional landlords.
[deleted]
Lots of single family home owners also own their home as an investment. That‚Äôs the big reason to buy over rent.
So being a landlord and being a home owner are not the same, but both have a vested interest in keeping home prices high. This manifests in communities lobbying against higher density residential zoning or against nearby subsidized housing, homeless shelters, etc. ALL THE TIME.
But just like with landlords, it shouldn‚Äôt disqualify you from running for office. I just think the voters should know where that money‚Äôs coming from.
If you want to be an elected official, the ethical thing to do is to reveal potential conflicts of interest.
Edit: correction from below, replaced public servant with elected official
So you do not believe in government transparency? Or transparency in general? Do you believe secrets help everyone in the long run?
Except when you run for public office we need to know your conflicts of interest.  You aren't being forced to run for office.  I guess it would be fair if people could declare if they are disclosing or not and then leave that to the voters, but it would have to be very transparent that they did not disclose.  Like it should appear on the ballot who disclosed and who didn't.
Good way of all being paid like shit.  
Since we don't know how much the colleagues earn.
Wouldn't it be great if you could force a handful of citizens to give up more than half of their wages for a base human need to you monthly to finance your campaigns!
You need money AND time, which both goes together.
>you need money to run
Most candidates aren't from wealthy backgrounds
Absolutely THIS.
There is a HUGE difference btw having an investment property (1-9 units) and earning your sole income via real estate.
Bc you happen to invest in real estate vs the stock market, you can't run for office? That's next level nonsense. Arguably you could invest (on the market) in EXACTLY the type of shares or fund that supports / invests in huge gentrification projects and so forth. But bc it's indirect, it's better? Total BS.
Then vote for a candidate that agrees to tax land and ban airbnb.
Watch prices drop, rents drop and supply increase.
All rent is economic rent. In other words all landlords are rentiers. Landlords steal earned wealth from people who work for a living and do not add value commensurate with the rent they extract. Fuck landlords.

M√™me si un √©lu rend public ses avoirs, ou encore le fait d'√™tre un locataire, √ßa ne change pas que son pouvoir sur la gentrification est relativement faible n'en d√©plaise √† ceux qui pensent le contraire. Est-ce que quelqu'un ici peut faire un corr√©lation direct entre l'action pr√©cise d'un √©lu municipal et la gentrification, l'augmentation du prix des loyers et l'appr√©ciation du prix des plexs?

Non, c'est au coin St-Laurent et Laurier.
Je pense que c'est plus un jeu de mot de la part OP

Yes! Pmb c'est la meilleure bi√®re qui se fait au Qu√©bec! J'ai toujours des packs d'urgence au cas o√π! Vive le p√©ch√© Day
Vraiment pas la m√™me qualit√© de bi√®re il faut dire...
Sans aucun doutes la plus belle et spectaculaire, mais la meilleure?  √áa c‚Äôest discutable. ;)
Awww appreciate the knowledge my friend
Je fais de m√™me!   La Kentucky Bastard de Nickel Brook Brewing Co en est une autre d‚Äôun style similaire que j‚Äôaffectionne particuli√®rement.
Jcomprend le statut que √ßa porte PMB √† cause de son histoire, mais √ßa fais un bout que Bas-Canada ont le dessus dans le style
BBC joue dans les pastry Stout. Vraiment pas la m√™me affaire qu'une PMB. Surtout si on consid√®re la stabilit√© du produit. Pis ce n'est pas une question d'histoire quand le produit est encore bon et domine autant. Mais je comprends que des gens pr√©f√®rent les pastry sucr√© √† la pmb
BDBC ont deja sortie des BA non-pastry aussi qui √©tait sup√©rieure d'apr√®s moi...voir Monument. Mais bon, rendu la c'est accessibilit√© et la quantit√© qui manque. En esp√©rant qu'ils peuvent plus en distribuer une fois que l'usine est b√¢tie.
>sup√©rieure d'apr√®s moi
On a chacun nos opinions! Mais on s'en reparlera quand BBC pourra offrir un produit de ce genre stable et sur une longue p√©riode! Ts√© le p√©ch√© Day ce n'est pas par ce que c'est un produit ordinaire ;)

J'ai toujours aim√© le parc Angrignon.
Mais depuis que j'habite √† Munich, le English Garden est devenu mon parc pr√©f√©r√©.
Yay more videos like this! Well researched and presented!
Ren√© Levesque parc in Lachine for sure!!!
This is why it's so frustrating when politicians push back on pedestrian zones, green spaces, etc. The boost in quality of life is so obvious and immediate.
The city bought and converted an old empty lot near us and it went from "empty lot" to having 20-50 people hanging out, eating, drinking, playing music all the time, overnight. It's wild to me that some people can't see the benefit in that.
The park on De Lorimier between Ontario and Sherbrooke was pretty shabby back in the day. It's amazing how it's transformed into a happy family neighborhood hang out.
Lafontaine -- bc it's super central, but big enough to have many zones for all kinds of activities, & Maisonneuve, bc it's so huge even when it's busy you have a lot of space.
Have definitely really appreciated how great the public spaces are -- year round -- during the pandemic and even now, more interested in being in them than even on a patio/ restaurant/ someone's private space most of the time. I hope restaurant deliveries etc to parks continue.
Also -- it's Jeanne-Mance not Jean-Mance. The name "Anne" -- like Marianne -- is clearly heard in the pronunciation, so Zj-anne.
J‚Äôaime bien le parc Fr√©d√©ric Back. Mais c‚Äôest un peu difficile de s‚Äôy rendre en v√©lo.

Beaver lake is awesome
Ren√© Levesque and Jarry around the pound are probably my two favorite parks to hang out.
That was great! Very informative, not too long that I got bored watching it, very clear audio as well. Hope to see more videos on Montreal :)
Le parc Bellerive est probablement l'un des plus sous-estim√©s de la ville! 
Similaire au parc Verdun mais √† l'Est de la ville avec des belles installations et m√™me quelques acc√®s √† l'eau!
Simple video yet effective and informative. Are you doing this for a school project or just for fun? Because I know somebody who makes montreal related videos who could use the help of an Anglophone sometime...  By the way, my favorite parc is La Fontaine... im really attached to  it emotionnally.
Parc Ignace-Bourget has been my go-to lately. It's a tiny park in the corner of the Sud-Ouest and mostly overshadowed by the nearby Angrignon park. This place is activity-central, and there isn't a single bit of space wasted. Great place to go if you want to do something active and outdoors.
St Viateur or Laurier. Best vibes.
Does the Copenhagenize index include bike lanes without separation from traffic (just painted lines on a street)? Because Montreal has way too many of those and they just aren't safe enough.
Yes! My goal this summer is to bike to every park on the island.
As expected this thread is already loaded with simps
Great video and <3 Montreal
Trop bien fait.
Awesome video! You should do that same montage from the first 10 seconds, but in Griffintown, where it's just a bunch of cement and pavement shots lmao
Or just like 50 different shots of the canal from different angles
Great video.  Very well done!
i'll always love Mount Royal for just how woodsy it is (and great for hiking), but since my family and i used to go to Shakespeare in the Park in Westmount park so often when i was younger, it's the park i have the most fondness for.
Very good video!
Getting heavy VOX vibes. Insta subbed
You rocked the video. Check out City Beautiful on YT if you haven't already. Looking forward to the next one.
Love a video pertaining to urban planning and public space!!! Good video!! The need for accessible and vibrant public spaces for all populations are at an all time high!!
This one of the many reasons I'm moving to Montreal from Vancouver. The city just feels more alive and laid back.
The Verdun riverside is AWESOME. Grew up there. I still go there to chill when I got to my parent's house.  
Parc Ignace Bourget in Ville √âmard is neat especially in the winter.  
Angrignon parc, used to go drink beer there when I was underage. So many stupid memories.  
Parc Arthur Terrien in Verdun.
"There's a reason why you can't have a backyard in montreal...it's sooooooooo freaking expensive, thanks god we have this "  
Fix the intro for you!
Good video, one thing I hate about Montreal right now is that Valerie Plante is treating every borough/neighborhood like its the plateau and its super fucking annoying. She also puts too much stock into cycling for a city where, yes there‚Äôs a lot of cyclists, but they‚Äôre all super dangerous, don‚Äôt respect road rules WHAT so ever, and act like cars are always the problem. Half the time they dont even use the bicycle lanes that are either on the same street or on the next street paralleled. I love that there are a billion parks in mtl but I dont think we need to close off streets to create an artificial ones. Fave park is Jarry. Also get outta here saying jeanne mance park has a mixed demographic its deadass the exact same hipsters each weekend who have nothing better to do.
Unrelated but you are very cute üòä
Thanks so much! means a lot
Le meilleur parc pour voir des deals de drogues louches la nuit entre 2 chars avec les vitres teint√©es... en tout cas c'√©tait comme √ßa dans ma jeunesse.
Thank you - I'm so glad you enjoyed it!!
J'allais dire la m√™me chose! J'appr√©cie beaucoup le canal Lachine aussi
I discovered that park through Pok√©mon go community days lol. Great place
You!
It's such an amazing place & somewhat undiscovered outside Lachine!
I've heard relatively young people complaining about the pedestrianised streets because they can't drive right up to the place they want to go and have to walk for 5 minutes.  And we wonder why there's an obesity epidemic.
I love Maisonneuve, I moved close to it last year and I enjoy the cycling circuit very much! Great safe spot to exercise!
Thanks for the tip about Jeanne-Mance pronunciation - and agreed, Lafontaine is one of my favourites, too. I stop by there during my daily walk/morning coffee and there's always some sort of activity or gathering going on.
pas si tu arrives par le Nord! :) mais oui, il est un peu loin du centre c'est vrai.
C'est vraiment un parc surr√©aliste, pour les curieux: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvk7gnfGSzs
C'est pas si pire par la piste Christoph-Colomb! Je vire vers l'est sur Jacques-Causault (pas de piste) puis j'entre derri√®re le Maxi. C'est pas l'entr√©e principale mais pas besoin de rouler longtemps coll√© au autos
Si tu viens de l'est par contre, je n'ai pas de conseils d√©sol√©!
J'ai r√©cemment d√©couvert le parc √† cause des amis qui sont passionn√©s des oiseaux.
j'ai essay√© d'y arriver il y a une semaine mais je me suis retrouv√© derri√®re Maxis
Definitely going to check it out!
Love Beaver Lake! It was the first place I biked to when I moved to the city. :)
I'll have to check out Ren√© Levesque!
Jarrys cool but it could use some more trees in that super large open space imo
> The officers were looking for a suspect described as a Black 18-year-old man whose height was 1.85 metres, whereas Burke stands at 1.70 metres and was 54 years old. Burke and the suspect were also wearing different styles of clothing. 
lol, jesus. Open and shut case, Jean-Philippe!
> The judge found Auger and Th√©or√™t guilty of wrongfully arresting, handcuffing and searching Burke; failing to inform him of the motives for their arrest, using excessive force and being disrespectful toward him. 
> 
> McMahon also said they were "negligent or careless of the health and safety of Monsieur Burke."
"Why don't people like us!?!!"
For the ethics committee to find a police officer at fault, I can't imagine how egregious the facts they were presented must have been. Just reading the article makes me angry, and we know the police must have hidden the best.
> "What struck us back when [Burke] first contacted us is this phenomenon of jumping on any Black person that they could find at the time even if the suspect description just does not match his profile," Niemi said.
 > "We want a decision that clearly reflects the principle that Black lives matter, and hopefully in this case we will have that." 
I don't remember which sitcom made that joke/observation (I think it's *Everybody Hates Chris*), but there's a scene where a convenience gets robbed and the police asks the owner to describe the perp. The owner goes "Black guy, medium complexion, about 6 feet tall and around 170-180 pounds, medium built, he had a tat..." and the mind of the officer goes "Black guy, black black black black black black" while the owner gives a detailed description. 
It's a trope for a reason, it happens very often.
Funny how /r/Quebec doesn't talk about any of this but are the firsts to fight agaisn't any news calling them racist lmao.
As a french canadian Quebecer, i've never seen more racist and angry people online and irl
The photo with the Labatt Dry 7.1% is amazing.
Wait - but Blanchette and Legault said we have no racism problems in Quebec?
Did they lie to me?
WHAT??? SINCE WHEN????? WTF??????? 
/S
Quelle surprise. Je suis choqu√©. Quelle sera la prochaine r√©v√©lation. Que l'on doive respirer pour vivre.
(/S juste au cas)
Yet again... 
** surprised pikachu face **
I am just here for the comments.
A step in the right direction, but meaningless without actual consequences. Fingers crossed.
Why is this a surprise? Have none of you ever lived Montreal?
>Sanctions for the officers based on the ethics board decision are expected in the coming months. 
Does anyone know what kind of sanction could apply here?
Systemic. Racism.
WHAATTTTT NOO WAY.....Who would have known
I thought it was the Beaverton article...
I'm a brown guy, police stopped me and asked me for ID because they were looking for a white guy with totally different hair. He even showed me the picture. I tell him that the dude in the picture is white to which he replies you match the clothing description. I was dumbfounded, honestly.
Yeah... I'm generally critical of this kind of complaint but it certainly seems warrented in this case.
Edit: What the fuck? I said I agree with the guy who complained about this! And by being critical I mean that every complaint should be evaluated on it's own merits without bias.
theres a Chapelle joke thats eerily similar.
/r/Quebec est un ostie de sub de r√©actionnaires identitaires. 
Si un sujet est pas √† propos d'√† quel point le Qu√©bec est une minorit√© qui fait face √† de la m√©chante discrimination du Canada Anglais, alors √ßa les int√©resse fuck all.
"La police du Qu√©bec est racistes" /r/Quebec: * *criquets* *
"Un sub de streamer accuse le Qu√©bec d'√™tre raciste parce qu'ils se font attaquer par un groupe de racistes identitaires Qu√©b√©cois" /r/Quebec: *"C'est la fucking guerre, comment ose-t-il dire des choses comme √ßa √† propos de nous! On va en parler pendant trois semaines! Come on gang, brigadons!"*
"Les Canadiens vont reconna√Ætre les terres autochtones" /r/Quebec: *"Ostie que c'est du blabla inutile et niaiseux et bas√© sur de la fausse histoire, maudit que les wokes SJW vont trop loin"*
"Do they even speak real french in Quebec?" /r/Quebec: *"C'EST LE PLUS GRAND AFFRONT ET L'EXEMPLE DE RACISME ET DE DISCRIMINATION LA PLUS FLAGRANTE DE NOTRE SOCI√âT√â MODERNE!"*
I got banned from r/Quebec for pointing out that a poster was wrong when they stated that Quebec lost the referendum due to non-Quebeckers voting non and the 'real Quebeckers' voted "Oui". The mod then banned me from messaging them and gave no valid explanation for their actions. 
Its literally a French MAGA equivalent over there.
Thanks for calling it out. I too am of here and from here, but our concitoyens in that subreddit have been clear over the top spoiling for a fight and brigading every critical idea.
Ben, honn√™tement, c'est pareil partout le racisme. C'est pas mieux au US et c'est pas mieux en France. Les racistes qui admettent l'√™tre sont rares et, g√©n√©ralement, pas particuli√®ment int√©ress√©s √† changer.
Le racisme anti-noir aux √âtats-Unis est p√©nible √† voir.
La particularit√© des Qu√©b√©cois racistes c'est que, √©tant donn√© qu'ils sont une minorit√© (dans le Canada et en Am√©rique du Nord), ils pensent qu'ils sont trop maltrait√©s par les francophobes et donc des victimes, et les victimes peuvent pas √™tre racistes, on le sait bien ^^/s Ils essaient juste de sauvegarder leur culture, voyons. 'Est menac√©e, leur culture. 
Pis, √† part √ßa, le racisme syst√©mique, √ßa existe pas. C'est juste une expression invent√©e par les wokes gauchistes de Mourrial. J'ai un ami Noir, c'est le seul du village, pis y dit que le racisme syst√©mique, √ßa existe pas. Quelle preuve de plus voulez-vous??
a modit√©
I've seen a few posts claim that 1. there's little to no racism in Quebec, 2. victims are lying, 3. if there's racism it's not worse than the US therefore... good?
That's a few isolated idiots mind you, which I've promptly blocked because I have better shit to do with my day, but they somehow exist nonetheless.
>firsts to fight agaisn't any news calling them racist lmao.
...Them? La police? Y'a en masse de threads r√©cent ou les gens sont d'accord pour dire qu'il existe du racisme dans la police de Repentigny et autre pourtant.
r/quebec is basically r/canada mais EN FRAN√áAIS ICITTE, and for those who don't know r/canada got taken over by the far right a while ago.
have you seen people on twitter angry that the habs want to acknowledge First Nations? 
It is like the onion wanted to mock the US reparations movement for people who want to be angry that their forefathers colonized first.
meilleure fa√ßon de commencer la journ√©e
Hahaha!
They said there were no systemic racism issues in Quebec I believe. But yes.
I'm actually surprised it got officially recognized. Was expecting another non-answer. I wonder if it'll make any difference and what those changes would be.
Its not a surprise except if your a Quebec politician or a mod of r/Quebec
Paid suspensions, no doubt.
Colorblindness at its finest!
Isnt nice of them to be able to see beyond the color of your skin? /s
Classic criminal mastermind move. Sneak into a bathroom and change your skin color, but keep the clothes on. Good on the cops for staying vigilant. 
The other one is everyone knows crooks can shave real quick, but only elite criminals can grow a beard real fast.
You're generally critical of racial profiling complaints?
> And by being critical I mean that every complaint should be evaluated on it's own merits without bias. 
That's not what people normally use "being critical of" to mean. I'm not sure I've *ever* seen or heard it used that way,  so it's not exactly surprising that you received a lot of downvotes.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4IIE-Z0CA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL4IIE-Z0CA)
Entirely possible Chris would have done something similar on this show though.
That's really a perfect summary of that sub! Unfortunately r/montreal has started to look more and more like r/quebec recently...
> /r/Quebec est un ostie de sub de r√©actionnaires identitaires. 
J'ai tellement bloqu√© de monde sur air Quebec pour √™tre soit idiot soit un identitaire de marde que c'est rendu un site agr√©able. Mais c'est p-e moi qui s'est enfoui la t√™te dans le sable.
Tu as totalement raison. J‚Äôai arr√™t√© d‚Äôaller sur ce sub l√†
R/quebec c'est surtout des photos de paysages, des traductions tout les croches et des memes.  Si tu vois juste la merde c'est peut-√™tre que tu la cherche
L'histoire du sub de streaming c'est une streameuse qui c'est fait harcel√©e par son voisin qui a des probl√®mes psychiatriques, elle a bl√¢m√©e le Qu√©bec au grand complet et la r√©action sur leur sub, c'√©tait le thread le plus raciste que j'ai vue depuis longtemps. C'est pas mal √©vident par le nombre de commentaires effac√©s dans leur thread...
C'est un probl√®me reconna√Ætre les terres autochtones **quand les autochtones que tu reconnais ne viennent pas de la terre que tu leur reconna√Æt**. Tu ne trouveras aucun historien qui reconna√Æt que Montr√©al √©tait un territoire Mohawk, le registre historique est clair comme de l'eau de roche. Mais les Mohawks sont am√©rindiens et leurs terres ne leur seront jamais remisent, donc on se donne bonne conscience en leur reconnaissant des terres qui n'√©tait pas les leurs ?
La charge que les Qu√©b√©cois ne parlent pas un vrai fran√ßais est une des choses que les anglophones disaient et disent encore √† propos des Qu√©b√©cois pour ne pas avoir √† les √©couter, c'√©tait raciste dans le temps, c'est raciste encore aujourd'hui. Il y a des √©quivalents pr√©sents dans tous les efforts de discr√©diter un groupe ethnique, par exemple les gens qui disent que la qualit√© de l'anglais chez les afro-am√©ricain est une raison pour ne pas les √©couter.
Je bannis et je continuerai de bannir les gens qui disent que l'on ne parle pas un vrai fran√ßais.
>r/Quebec est un ostie de sub de r√©actionnaires
T'es sure que t'en fait pas parti de la communaut√© avec ton commentaire r√©actionnaires p√©dantesque?
Oh god, let me guess, they literally quoted Parizeau's "l'argent et les votes ethniques"? That sub sounds awful
C'est weird en plus vu qu'en grande partie ils vont reconna√Ætre le racisme contre les premi√®res nations, qui ressemble quand m√™me la discrimination et l‚Äôoppression qu'a subit le peuple qu√©becois, mais de moindre degr√©, mais le racisme envers certaines ethnies, dont les musulmans et les noirs, ils le nient. 
> Pis, √† part √ßa, le racisme syst√©mique, √ßa existe pas.
Est-ce que tu peux d√©finir le racisme syst√©mique pour moi? 9/10 les gens qui disent cela ont un d√©finition de racisme syst√©mique pas mal particuli√®re.
P.c.q. a titre d'exemple le syst√®me de r√©servation, ainsi que l'indian acte presque en entier, est un tr√®s bon exemple de racisme syst√©mique.
Pas vraiment non. You could argue they are far more french than r/Canada which would be factually true, but taken over by the far right? Most of the sub literally shits on Conservatives, the PPC, anti-vaxxers  - those in support of them usually get downvoted to oblivion. What an absurd comment.
Perso une grosse black tablette m'interpelle encore plus un lundi matin.
Yeah sorry, that was sarcasm.    
Isn‚Äôt having police targeting specific races basically the definition of systemic racism?   Or am I missing something here.
M√©chante histoire. Est-ce que parmis les t√©moins il y avait quelqu'un qui reconnaissait le couple aggresseur, pour pouvoir l'identifier √† la police? Me semble que c'est un cas de prison pour ce genre de chose si tu r√©ussis √† identifier le gars, non? 
Et sinon, guettez le parc de chien et quand tu revois la fille ou le gars, tu les suit discr√®tement pour savoir o√π ils habitent. C'est tellement choquant que je serais pret √† passer quelques avant-midi au parc si ton voisin peut donner une bonne description du couple. Je suis serieux, j'habite la Petite Italie donc c'est peut-etre pas loin et j'ai un horaire flexible.
J'ai rien compris
Quel quartier pour le fun?
Terrible... pourquoi √ßa arrive jamais quand je suis l√† ce genre de truc. J'esp√®re que j'interviendrais, que ton voisin est correct, et que le gars se fasse pogner. Sa blonde et son chien ne sont pas en s√©curit√© √† c√¥toyer quelqu'un avec un tel probl√®me d'agressivit√©.
J'ai √©t√© t√©moin d'une sc√®ne semblable vraiment proche de chez moi sur Beaubien dans la petite Italie. Pour une histoire de parking. Un habitu√© d'un caf√© a saut√© dans la face d'un cycliste qui avait coup√© le char d' une amie qui se stationnait. Le cycliste a cri√© une insulte au char et le client du caf√© s'est jet√© sur le cycliste, crachait dessus pis lui a mis un doigt dans l'oeil. C'√©tait weird tout le monde a fig√© 5 min et quand ils ont pris la d√©fense du cycliste le mec c'est mis a les menacer et cracher dessus. C'est comme du fucking calme tout le monde.
Quelle histoire terrible et d√©solante, j'esp√®re qu'il va vite se remettre.
Attends je ne comprends pas, une propri√©taire de chien proteste contre qui avant l'arriv√©e du voisin? Quel vaccin le chien a besoin? ?
Le dude devrait aller passer une couple de semaines en taules, √† mon avis.
Quel parc?
C'est vraiment d√©solant pour ton voisin, pauvre monsieur il ne m√©ritait pas √ßa... Le fameux chum lui [il m√©riterait √ßa](https://www.reddit.com/r/ActualPublicFreakouts/comments/o9251x/dog_abuser_in_brooklyn_gets_dealt_with_accordingly/) et j'ai comme l'impression qu'ils sont probablement pas apte √† avoir un chien.
Tabarnak, comme on dit.
L'ambiance est vraiment dark, pas mal partout.  on m'a invit√© sur la page de Non au Passport vaccinal sur FB et juste pour le fun, j'suis all√© y jeter un coup d'oeil, oufffff c'est sombre et ouffff ca en devient alarmant. Le QI est pas fort la bas.     
Concernant ton histoire, j'peux pas croire que le monde reste la a regarder au lieu d'aider. Ce monde devient paresseux et egoiste.
[deleted]
Pas grand chose √† faire √† part la plainte
Je suis d'accord avec toi. J'aurais aim√© √™tre l√† pour t√©moigner, mais surtout pour intervenir. Cela dit, je l'aurais fais en gang. Intervenir seul, c'est tr√®s risqu√©. Une vie change tr√®s vite via une telle violence. On y pense avant de se lancer dans ce genre de situation dangereuse. Quelle horrible histoire par contre. Et avoir √©t√© l√†, j'aurais au moins recrut√© du monde apte √† calmer le tout. J'esp√®re qu'il s'en sortira bien.

Be careful out there. if you‚Äôre a local, you feel it too right? like we have a new gen of degen and it is starting last couple weeks ish.  When this shit behavior spreads and leaks eventually, into the criminal world, we will see the wave of petty crime, harassments, smash & grab and thefts everyone expected early last summer.  
Si ton voisin veut recruter la reddit army, on ira au parc avec lui, en respectant une distance safe je le jure!  üòÖ
We are in montreal tbh, bunch of pussies
L‚Äôhistoire est tellement mal r√©dig√©e qu‚Äôelle en est incompr√©hensible. Le chien devait se fait vacciner? Je ne suis pas.
Ceci dit, la plupart des propri√©taires de chiens ont souvent des comportements irrespectueux, donc le recours √† la violence n‚Äôest pas si √©tonnant. Ils manquent de civisme la plupart du temps. Des √©tudes empiriques ont d√©montr√© que les propri√©taires de chien ont un QI plus bas que les propri√©taires de chats.
Tu trouveras pas le gars sur Reddit lmao
[deleted]
J'avais propos√© la m√™me chose, merci. Mais la fille a appel√© la police pour savoir si mon voisin √©tait correct. Mon voisin a d√©j√† d√©pos√© sa plainte. Vues les fractures et les h√©morragies, l'affaire sera vite class√©e.
Le voisin de OP s'est pogn√© avec une fille dans un parc √† chien. Elle chi√¢lait que son chiot n'√©tait pas encore vaccinner et que les autres chiens se calment (lol).
OP dit √† la fille qu'elle ne peut pas √™tre au parc si son chien n'est pas encore vaccinner, selon la loi.
Elle part et revient plus tard avec son chum qui d√©cide de ne pas dire un mot et juste battre le voisin d'OP.
J'pense, s't'un peu m√©langer mais √ßa semble √™tre pas mal √ßa.
Ah et le vaccin c'est pas covid, c'est les trucs standards pour les nouveaux chiots.

Parc P√®re-Marquette, coin des Carri√®res.
flair says petite-patrie
C'est parce que les gens savent que tu es l√†. Alors ils attendent que tu pars avant de faire leur action.
Tout les chiots ont besoin de vaccin dit de bases avant de pouvoir aller dans des parc a chien etc fr√©quenter d autre chien
Style contre la rage et autre maladies
On ne sait pas comment la chicane a pogn√©, mais la fille protestait qu'elle avait le droit d'√™tre au parc m√™me si son chien √©tait pas encore vaccin√© (rage et autres). Les autres promeneurs avaient du mal √† la convaincre de quitter le parc, alors ont laiss√© tomber. Mon voisin a tent√© sa chance sur un ton plus calme.
P√®re Marquette selon OP
>j'peux pas croire que le monde reste la a regarder au lieu d'aider. Ce monde devient paresseux et egoiste.
Je ne suis pas surpris... Je suis une femme et quand j'avais 17 ans un homme super grand et costaud m'a menac√© physiquement en bloquant ma sortie sur le m√©tro et voulait me p√™ter la guele devant tout le monde √† genre midi et *personne* m'a aid√©. J'ai finalement r√©ussi √† m'enfuire, mais sans l'aide des autres. Les gens ne veuillent rien savoir. Ils s'√©loignaient de nous sans dire un mot, sans tirer le frein d'urgence..

Sans trop √©laborer pour pas me faire ban, mais outre la vengeance il y aurait plusieurs choses cot√© l√©gal √† faire pour s'assurer que ce couple regrette longuement leurs actions. En commencant par le chien pas vaccin√© n'est surment pas enregistrer etc etc
Aussi le voisin devrait consult√© un avocat ou autre service l√©gal publique pour connaitre les recours et d√©dommagements possible contre cette attaque pr√©m√©dit√©e.

Le premier coup de poing a d√ª l'√©branler tellement y s'en attendait pas. J'imagine qui n'a pas re√ßu de coup dans les 40 derni√®res ann√©es non plus. Le reste des coups se sont enchain√© pendant qui avait peine √† se recroqueviller. 
J'te garantit ; tous ceux qui se disent "moi j'aurais r√©agi". Cumule les, coupe 85% du lot et nous voil√† pr√®s de la r√©alit√© des gens qui auraient r√©ellement emp√™ch√© √ßa. Pas qui ne sont pas brave ces 85% la...√ßa s'est pass√© vite pis s't'ai surement trop sketch pour savoir comment s'y prendre
Lol... Le monde n'est pas un film de Marvel avec des gentils et des m√©chants, cest √©norm√©ment plus complexe que √ßa. Quelle vision r√©ductrice et na√Øve du monde tu as!
Mon voisin, promeneurs de chiens, est justement un grand d√©fenseur des pitbulls. J'ai toujours eu du mal, mais √† force de conversations, il m'a (presque) convaincu que ce n'est pas au niveau du chien, le probl√®me...
D'o√π tu sort √ßa?? jpense ta omis ton /s
Concentre toi sur le 2e paragraphe si tu as des probl√®me de compr√©hension, mais pourtant c'est tr√®s simple √† comprendre m√™me avec l'intro un peu "th√©√¢trale" 
Puis oui les chiens se font vaccin√© depuis longtemps, tout comme la plupart d'entre nous, humains, qui en ont re√ßu quelques uns il y a 20~30ans. J'imagine que ta la t√™te tellement profond√©ment plong√© dans la pand√©mie que tu pense juste √† √ßa aussit√¥t que ta lu "vaccin" 
Edit: pis t'es fameuse √©tudes ta une source??? Qu'es qui arrive pour les familles qui on un chien et deux chats √ßa s'annule l'effet du Qi ?
Surrement un chiot. Normalement tu ne devrais pas emmener ton chiot dans les parcs avant min 4 mois, quand tout les vaccins de base (rage, bordatella) sont fait et que les anti parasite ont √©t√© pris. Tout les v√©t√©rinaire et les √©leveurs √©thiques sont super pr√©cis l√† dessus.
non, surement les vaccins de base.
J'trouve ca logique qu'un chiot pas encore vaccin√© soit mis a l'ecart des espaces canins.
Wait what??? Ya pas juste la covid dans vie... Va dont prendre un peu de soleil
Ton chien est suppos√© √™tre vaccin√© pour divers affaires si tu veux l'amener au parc.
Le vaccin Covid est un vaccin de base pour les chiens oui depuis bien avant l‚Äô√©pid√©mie qu‚Äôon a pr√©sentement.
Edit : ok pour √™tre pr√©cis, c‚Äôest pas pour la covid mais le coronavirus canin appel√© CCoV
Wait, la blonde du gars qui a tabass√© ton voisin a appel√© la police pour avoir des nouvelles sur son √©tat de sant√©?!?
Do be careful here. This is prime habitat for cyclists of the endurance/not-out-for-a-commute/spandex-for-speed breed.  They will show their aggravation if you're out for a pleasure ride and you in any way provide an impediment to their stats.  They're travelling quite fast so do shoulder check before switching lanes.
Edit: I don't mean to cast them in a pejorative light (well maybe a light jest), it is a race track so it stands to reason that it might be used for such things.
Derni√®re fois que j'y suis all√© √† v√©lo, je me suis plant√© sur un des poteaux au centre et j'ai eu besoin de 18 points de suture.

So much fun riding this track, I make vroom vroom noises every time I'm down the straightaway
Cab I go with my roller blade?
Some sense of normalcy. Sigh.
What a waste of perfectly good parking spots! Down with this mayor!
I rode my motorcycle there once, though I do wish I could do a track day there one day but that likely won‚Äôt ever happen

It‚Äôs always a good idea to do shoulder check before switching lanes, whether you are mixed in with fast people or not. In fact, it‚Äôs exactly like driving.
it's not that bad, I go run there sometimes, there are also pedestrian alley in some part of the track. But yeah look before crossing.
That applies to most bike paths - so many people don't shoulder check or signal at all on the bike paths, and it makes riding a bike much more dangerous than it should be.
I‚Äôm sure if you went driving on a highway at 50 kph instead of 100, people would get angry if you swerved in front of them or something! I‚Äôm a cyclist and love seeing people there just for fun and not for training, I even do it with my gf sometimes. Nobody is mad you‚Äôre out for a pleasure ride, they‚Äôre mad that you probably put both your safety at risk without realize. Just have fun and be alert :)
Slow on the right fast on the left, that‚Äôs like pretty universal and good practice. People use the track to workout, what‚Äôs the problem?
Je suis un de ces cyclistes qui s'entra√Ænent √† l'occasion sur le circuit. Normalement, j'y vais t√¥t le matin justement pour limiter le risque de collision et pour ne pas √™tre ralenti par les gens en promenade.
Ceci dit, oui, v√©rifiez toujours vos angles mort.
If folks who aren't training would assiduously stay to the right and not wander aimlessly all over the width of the track or ride 3 abreast whilst oblivious to their surroundings chatting to their friends it'd be easier for all........ Those who ride faster need also to be sensible and not assume ownership of the CGV too.
They sound like asshole drivers in the fast lane.

I also had many close calls with pedestrians along the west bike lane at Parc LaFontaine. People don't realize that a bike going 30km/h doesn't brake at will and they step-in without a care in the world.
Same idiots driving cars are also found on bikes, there are bad drivers and bad cyclists lol (and pedestrians/joggers too)
Just watch out for the Brits Aussies and Japanese ;)
Some of those people are one and the same, yes.

Yes but if you want to do some hard work you need to keep your wits about you, too many obliviots , especially on sunny warm days ;)
On a race track might as well go with clutchless sequential. I have a quickshift on my bike and it's a blast

JFC, what is wrong with people? It takes literally zero effort for me to wake up every morning and not do a hate crime that day. It's so disheartening to know that some people are actually expending energy during their finite time on this earth to do something so wrong-headed, so pointless and so negative. Just spreading bad feelings around for no useful purpose when they could have instead sat on their asses and watched Netflix.
MTL is so international, I can't even imagine where and how this started and for how long it's been going on now, maybe more investigation is needed to go to the roots of this issue.
I don't want to downplay anything with this comment, I'm simply genuinely curious: are hate crimes actively on the rise because people do more "crime per capita" than before for whatever reason, or are reported instances of hate crimes on the rise because the population, the police and the elected officials have shifted their awareness / focus towards these particular crimes and report / investigate them more?
For example, and without the intent of downplaying any events, if in the past assaults were categorized as such but are now categorized as hate crime, then that would change the stats, right? Another type of example, if someone previously thought "this person is verbally abusive, because they're an asshole" and didn't report it, but now instead they think "this person is verbally abusive, because they're doing a hate crime" then this would also change the stats, right?
Serious question. In other areas it has been reported that anti-asian hate crimes is heavily black on asian. Does the same phenomenon exist in Montreal or is it different?  Anyone with insight?
Sadly with covid leading to a rise in anti-asian crimes, and this super shitty year causing stress for everyone, this doesn't surprise me at all.  I just hope that this year is an outlier and we'll leave all this behind us.
hardly surprising, last time i hung out in a mall before pandemic there was a group with matching crossed hammer hoodies just chilling
Not surprised.
Not surprising. 
COVID -> isolation and hard times -> mental illness -> rudeness/racism/cry for help/w.e
>In 2019, there were 87 race-related hate crimes, but that number jumped to 133 last year, according to the report.
Because 53% makes for a much scarier title.
Legault argued before Superior Court that Bill 21 would reduce hate crimes against Muslims by appeasing the righteous anger of the population against them... and the judge accepted this reasoning as marvellous. I see that this has not worked.
I would caution every one about a "rise in hate crime" when individual acts can be perceived as hatr crimes or even definitions of what "hate crimes" are to make it vague and all encompassing.
It's been my experience that Montreal's is a tame puppy compared to what people or media who can sell newspapers make it out to be. 
Minorities aren't absolved of discrimination, and often time, i've found minorities hatin' on their own groups. 
There is a strange division between the Rural mindset and Urban one, partly making us Montrealers unliked by Rural folks cause we're loud, obnoxious and perhaps self-centered. But i've noticed a strange arrofance from city people towards rural folks as well. 
We are NOT the US. 
And our racial tensions aren't as tense, nor exploited by our media...though perhaps in recent times may be bit more so.
Don't give in to the hate crime "statistics"
It's reaaaaalll easy use and mis-use stats to benefits anybody's POV. 
Covid got us tense cuz of contagion, but most people, and i mean MOST people miss hugs, kisses, and don't give a flying fuck where you comes from. 
We've been apart from each other for an extendws period of time, and this ain't the time to get worked up about "antifa" and their macaroni dioramas that they build in their mom's basement while using the iphones the government money they got paid for
--or the idiot xenophobes that you meet trough a friend of a friend that think they know anything about economics, finance and trade because they watch TVA nouvelles and listen to old people rant as every propagandic word fills their pockets and make those same xenophobes less money--that sound just as crazy as any meth heads you'll encounter in the village.
Most people love, and most people don't give a fuck. Hop off social media, take a walk and kiss your neighbor (and hope you dont get sued for sexual assault XD)
What this actually means : 53% more hate crimes are being detected by the police. This doesn't necessarily mean more people are doing this. It could mean that more people call the police for those crimes or that the police cares more about detecting those crimes. Which is a good thing, no ?
The issue is, that the "Hate Crime" label gets added to everything that involves say for example an arab guy getting punched... no matter the context as long as he starts screaming that it was a "hate crime"
A lot of these "Hate Crimes" stem from situations that would occur between two people of the same race/religion/whatever and is just called a "Hate Crime" because the current environment is way too oversensitive and calling it a "Hate Crime" is an easy win for whoever screams the loudest. It also absolves wheoever claims it was a "Hate Crime" from any backlash or responsibility...
To be clear its not ALL hate crimes, but it feels like a lot more than there would be.
Wait until you learn that most hate crimes are NOT perpetrated by white people!

Its not like the media and social media have been making people go insane with non stop virtue signaling, people also.been locked up for more than a year, lives ruined etc, and we expect everything to be normal now....
Montreal is really diverse, but Quebec has a lot of nationalism and the protection of the Qu√©b√©cois culture unfortunately often easily becomes xenophobia (if you‚Äôre from somewhere else, you‚Äôre disrupting our culture). Racial and cultural prejudice, unfortunately, is somewhat normalized across the province and that spreads to Montreal.
montreal had a large Neo-nazi problem back in the 90's. this shit aint new.
In what ways in MTL so international? asking as someone raised in mtl
I mean a big part of it is due to the fact that MTL is so international. People are living in close proximity to others of different cultures and the human failing of drawing conclusions about whole groups based on the actions of a few is bound to happen. Given human tribalism you have to expect tensions to grow in these circumstances.
According to the article, they're defining these crimes based on existing precedent and classification, and measuring from an increase in reporting. The crimes are stated to be very specifically on the basis of race, religion and sexuality. I don't claim to know why the increase is taking place, but I don't think a sudden significant increase over a year is caused by some collective decision to label incidents differently. It absolutely wouldn't come from a political or policing body choosing to "investigate more", seeing as they are reported by the victims, the cops aren't going out and surveying for potential hate crimes, they would never allocate those resources. It's actually incredibly hard to get any assault case looked at, whether it's a hate crime or someone jumping you in the street for literally any other reason. And just because the report numbers have increased doesn't mean any more effort is being put into resolving them.
I blame ideological recruiting from the far-right. Since the start of the pandemic, anti-vaxxs and anti-lockdown people have been "recruited" from right-wing propagandists (just look at √âric Duhaime and Maxime Bernier, or many of the crazy conspiracy theorists on social media : they all have that conservative or far-right ideology. Social media is a plague if you don't know how to use it.
Edit: the US alt-right ideology started to show up here a little before the pandemic. I've seen friends becoming pro-Trump\*, anti-immigration very quickly. Breaking news: they were following propagandists on Youtube and Facebook, reading from "alternative" right-wing media, etc.  
\*People are allowed to be pro-Trump. I was talking about that whole hatred / agressive ideology that comes with the guy.
This seems pretty obvious from the change in culture. It might be a broadening of the definition of hate crime, whether it's official or simply people's personal interpretation of events which they then report.
I somehow doubt Montreal on average became more racist, but maybe I'm wrong.
In my experience as an asian, its mostly been older quebecois or younger black people that throw verbal jabs at me. But that's only if I'm alone, if I'm with my (non-asian) friends then that never seems to happen ü§î
I‚Äôm Asian and when i was in High School, i was physically and verbally abused by people and most of them were black and arab.
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/viral-images-show-people-color-anti-asian-perpetrators-misses-big-n1270821
It generally correlates to lack of education, and it‚Äôs common that people of color in mainly western societies, like Canada and the us, are statistically less educated due to systematic racism. Not that I have any data on your specific question, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if that‚Äôs the case.

Et le fait que le COVID a son origine en Chine n'aide pas non plus. Et depuis un bon moment les chinois sont tr√®s mal repr√©sent√©s dans les m√©dias avec ce que fait le gouvernement chinois et leurs pions qui viennent brasser de la merde dans notre pays en harcelant les sino-canadiens qui sont vocaux contre le gouvernement chinois. Ah et aussi les histoires des chinois qui viennent acheter tout notre immobilier.
Vraiment,  on peut comprendre avec ce genre de publicit√© dans les m√©dias que la haine ait autant augment√©e. Et c'est triste parce que maintenant n'importe qui avec des yeux brid√©s va se faire attaquer verbalement ou physiquement √† cause de √ßa.
En tout cas, moi je bl√¢me le gouvernement chinois.
>It's been my experience that Montreal's is a tame puppy compared to what people or media who can sell newspapers make it out to be.
Exactement. Et je trouve que depuis un bon moment CTV News est parti sur un trip de vouloir d√©peindre le Qu√©bec et les qu√©b√©cois comme une nation de racistes intol√©rants. Et la communaut√© anglo-canadienne en mange parce qu'ils aiment donc √ßa accuser les qu√©b√©cois de tous les maux du monde.
As far as stats go, yes they are misleading at the best of times. 
For example Vancouver had like triple the amount of supposed anti asian hate crime reports as the next highest city in NA. San Francisco. 
But San Fran has had many more stabbings and other forms of assault against Asians in the same period. 
Both cities have high Asian populations. But the data being cited by our 'trustworthy' media is obviously flawed. 
Our media is liable as well for boosting these things by propping up China Bad for years. 
Every day there's another Canada is so Racist piece put out by 'our' media. At some point they're pushing the public to become more racist. 
Media narratives. Push polls. 'Statistics.'  
Social Programming, all of it. To what benefit?  Well the public doesn't benefit. So it has to be select political or private group benefit.
This is yet another fear peddling article with a slanted title. 53%? Why focus on this number at all? It makes the amount sound so high, and all the top comments are like "I'm not surprised, tons of racists around for X reason" . But scroll down into the article and you see the actual number in question, under 100 to a little over 100. So we are given the idea that we are being overwhelmed by violent racists when in fact this is an insignificant percentage of the population.
Just ignore the fear and hate peddling media and you'll be fine.
>kiss your neighbor
How about you kiss my neighbour? I'd rather play tongue hockey with an ashtray with Dumaurier butts and a drop of Molson Ex au tablet.
Right! Or that most of them are hoaxes perpetrated by the same people that claim to be the victim. Lots smollets  but not enough hate crimes.
Source? Also what about racially motivated hate crimes? Also, what‚Äôs your point?
I have a hard time believing that that's true in this country, but anyway, what's your point exactly?
your post is an hour old already and you didn't provide any proof to back up your claim, how long are we supposed to wait? LOL
Soooo hate crimes are up because people are trying to prevent hate crimes? That‚Äôs weird logic.
Quand tu brasses de la marde, √ßa sent mauvais. Mais cette merde se brassera pas tout seul.
J'esp√®re juste que c'est le pas en arri√®re qui va nous donner deux pas en avant.
Perso, je crois que le ton des discours sur les m√©dias sociaux y est pour beaucoup. J'ai l'impression que √ßa s'est calm√© derni√®rement, notament sur tiktok..  √áa prend beaucoup de colone pour une jeune  personne, ou quiquonque en fait, pour voir les choses avec la distance qu'il faut quand √ßa s'insulte et s'accuse de tout dans tous les sens. Le dommage que peut faire une seule personne en d√©versant sa haine est tr√®s grand, il teste tout le monde et va en radicaliser une poign√©e probablement surtout dans ce qu'il per√ßoit comme √©tant le 'groupe adverse' qui au final est souvent juste pas mal tout le monde qui est pas exactement comme lui. C'est aussi pour √ßa que les minorit√©s 'thread' sur un fil mince. Si tu pisses off la majorit√©, statistiquement √ßa va avoir plus de cons√©quences n√©faste. En retour beaucoup de haine va √™tre canalis√© sur la minorit√©.  En tout cas, je crois que la seule solution est de submerger les discours haineux dans la c√©lebration de la diversit√© et de pr√©parer les gens √† faire face √† ces disours et √† pas se faire prendre dans une spirale de haine et d'anthagonisme.. Bon je m'√©garre.
fuckin cry about it more
These numbers are for 2020, so they don't reflect people attempting to return to normal. And I'm not sure why some people's struggle to return to normal would have to include hate crimes. The whole point of my post is how fucking easy it is not to do a hate crime. I'm not even asking these hateful idiots to do something productive with their lives. Just do nothing, bigots. Stay home. Watch shows on Netflix. Eat a Big Mac. So much easier than going out and being a dick to someone.
I'm also not sure what virtue signaling has to do with this. Are you saying that it's a normal reaction to seeing multiple Facebook posts saying "I'm not a racist" to go out and scream at an Asian person? Or punch them in the face?
Yes, lives have been ruined and several of those lives were innocent Asian or Jewish or black people who got assaulted or killed by someone who believes in bullshit.
I mean you see similar stuff elsewhere... https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/51-spike-in-hate-crimes-spurred-partly-by-pandemic-toronto-police-report-finds-1.5998703
There is some truth in that, but it's a bit too convenient. I our search for a boogyman, there is a push for a narative demonizing 'the rest of Qu√©bec' and blaming something further away, I feel it's more based on bias.
What an incredibly ignorant post. Unbelievable that this stuff gets upvoted here. 
Here's a CBC article stating hate crimes are up 51% in Toronto.
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/51-spike-in-hate-crimes-spurred-partly-by-pandemic-toronto-police-report-finds-1.5998703

J'avoue que m√™me si je suis bien contente qu'il ait √©t√© d√©moli, une partie de moi avait un certain attachement envers cette monstruosit√©. Souvent avec mon ex-mari, si on avait le go√ªt de se d√©gourdir les pattes, on partait √† "laventure" sur le spaghetti en b√©ton. On aimait bien blaguer que quand on √©tait dessus, les entr√©es et les sorties changeaient de place parce que ce truc √©tait tellement compliqu√© et confus, une fois embarqu√©s dedans, on savait jamais exactement o√π on allait sortir. Une fois, on a fait un grand tour dessus pour finalement se ramasser exactement √† notre point de d√©part.

√Ä l'adolescence, j'ai d√©couvert le v√©lo. Lors de ma premi√®re grande randonn√©e seul, je me suis rendu au Mont-Royal. L'avenue du Parc me semblait tr√®s differente de ce qu'elle √©tait dans mon souvenir, mais j'√©tais incapable de dire en quoi. Je ne m'√©tais pas pos√© plus de questions que √ßa, j'avais pr√©sum√© que c'√©tait mon souvenir qui √©tait flou, tout simplement.
Et puis j'ai d√©couvert ces images. En effet, du Parc a beaucoup chang√© depuis mon enfance.

There are *lots* of stupid urban highways that symbolize how badly fucked up the planning of the 60s was, but this is one of the weirdest/funniest boondoggles to me.
Like, what even was the plan here? Outside of the park area, du Parc is just a regular city street. And just west of this spot des Pins turns narrow and hilly. Even if you're somehow *super* enthusiastic about moving lots of cars right through urban neighborhoods, like...in what universe would there ever be enough traffic to justify this design? Why turn *one random kilometer* in the middle of a city street into a highway?
‚ÄúProgress‚Äù lol
So weird to see the area without La Cit√©.
A voir de quoi ca a d'air aujourdhui avec 15 parc sur un coin de rue, je me demande just pourquoi il n'a pas de parcs a chiens... Ca serait le fun de pas avoir a aller au parc Jeanne Mance coin Mont royal entre 6H et 8H du matin. Pis une cloture...
Pour ceux qui ne savent pas, cet √©changeur √©tait sens√© faire partie de l'autoroute 415, longeant le Mont-Royal. Cela explique pourquoi il √©tait incroyablement sur-construit et hors-place dans un milieu urbain dense comme le plateau.

Ou alors c'est probablement un tinami du maire Drapreau qui a eu cette merveilleuse id√©e!
good ol‚Äô new rez‚Ä¶. sike
total abomination
Allez voir l'√©changeur Remembrance/C√¥te-des-Neiges d'antan et ce que √ßa a l'air aujourd'hui.
Ouatte de phoque. J‚Äôavais aucune id√©e
En quelle ann√©e eurent lieu les travaux de r√©fections qui ont fait disparaitre cet √©changeur?
When you own a cement company and you're the one bribing the government.
MAke Montreal great again
En plus √ßa a √©t√© bien fait, et assez rapidement. J'habite tout pr√®s, et je passais donc pr√®s du chantier souvent, et c'√©tait √©vident que les travaux progressaient √† bon train. Pour un r√©sultat final qui simplifiait consid√©rablement la vie de quiconque passait par la, qu'il soit √† pied, en v√©lo, ou en char. Sans compter que c'est beaucoup plus beau sans ce machin qui bloquait la vue de la montagne et du parc.
Quel parc est-ce qu‚Äôils ont ajout√©? Ils ont seulement rajout√© des lumi√®res partout.
J‚Äôimagine en partie pour la s√©curit√©/fluidit√© des pi√©tons aussi.
C'√©tait pas une autoroute. Just une grande route que la ville planifier a transform√© a autoroute, l'intersection √©tait la premi√®re √©tape de l'autoroute mais la plan a √©t√© annul√©e et l'intersection d√©truit
There are no additional parks. They closed off some streets to cars and made the intersection all on the same grade with lights.
certainly more greenspace then than now. so going by that metric, its much worse now

Litt√©ralement sur cette intersection en particulier.
Ah, moi "c't'en train de renderer, y'a beaucoup de layers faque c'est long"
Aaah c'√©tait toi!!    üòÜüòÜ
Iirc the original planning had Parc av as some sorta crosstown expressway hence the flyovers at Parc/ Des Pin. There was a bunch of wacky plans/ proposals around that time for similar projects such as a tunnel under Mont Royal from Decarie and a highway through the plateau to the east end.
C'√©tait comme √ßa partout dans le monde dans les ann√©e 60-70.  
On a d√©truit des quartiers entier pour mettre des autoroutes.
I remember getting stuck in traffic all the time in the late 90s there. Also not to mention how badly it was falling apart
Le plan √©tait de transformer parc a un autoroute come D√©carie.
It's in the works once they figure out what do on the mountain. It's nuts people go like 90 there.
La s√©curit√© de tout le monde en fait. Ce machin √©tait dangereux et compliqu√© √† naviguer pour qui que ce soit qui s'y s'embarquait, qu'importe leur moyen de transport.
√áa a cr√©√© des petits parcs en p√©riph√©rie comme [le Parc L√©o-Parizeau](https://www.google.ca/maps/@45.5113995,-73.5769238,3a,75y,315.5h,87.75t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1syyN06hRZ9Yr2-Yk2XUoe1Q!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) (le parking qui longe la bretelle) ou [le Parc Yvonne-Maisonneuve](https://www.google.ca/maps/@45.5108597,-73.5782358,3a,75y,95.51h,93.16t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s8FFFKV47lSts137fre4fsQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192). Puis √ßa a aussi agrandi le parc Jeanne-Mance.
Et comme le militant Dimitri Roussopoulos raconte dans [cette vid√©o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBUQf-X_oBw), c'√©tait assez dangereux pour que des gangs d'√©tudiants de McGill aillent escorter les femmes qui voulaient traverser.
EDIT: En fait, comme c'est mentionn√© dans le vid√©o, le parc qui s'appelait L√©o-Parizeau [a √©t√© renomm√© Parc Lucia-Kowaluk.](http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=7297,75337594&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&id=33014)
"greenspace" that you can't actually use, because you know, it's under a highway.
(Don't feed the troll)
Yeah yeah sure man okay
Are you being serious?
Y'a m√™me la photo d'OP √† 6m44s.
C‚Äôest triste quand m√™me √† cause que tout les quartiers qu‚Äôon a r√©ussi √† sauver sont devenus tellement joli et rempli de vie. Je suis content qu‚Äôils ont d√©cid√© de d√©truire cette intersection dans les ann√©es 2000s.
En fait, malgr√© ce spaghetti et la D√©carie et tous les autres tristes exemples locaux, Montr√©al a vraiment √©chapp√© en comparaison aux autres villes nord-am√©ricain.
Regarde [ces photos avant-apr√®s](http://iqc.ou.edu/2014/12/12/60yrsmidwest/); c'est vraiment choquant, ce qu'ils ont fait au mid-ouest des √âtats. D√©troit, Cincinnati, Minneapolis...ils ont tout d√©truit pour construire les Interstates.
Montreal got sparred the worst of it thanks to people who actually pushed hard. Metropolitan is a horrible idea but burrying most of the ville Marie saved downtown. Even now the 15 and Turcot is so much better not only to drive on but look at as well. US cities got the full bulldozer, specifically areas with large minority populations
Lots of those rust belt cities mentioned in that link suffered seriously economic decline from closure of major industries. By that point the interstates weren't even a factor
Number 1! Number 1!
If it could only achieve that in winter...
Global warming wouhouu!!!
0¬∞C in the summer of 1950?!  damn.
Definitely didn‚Äôt feel as hot as the hottest summers tho
Cet √©t√© a √©t√© d√©geu. Y'a fait chaud et humide que tout √©tait collant. Les arbres et les plantes √©taient toutes √† moiti√©e mortes par le manque de pluie. C'√©tait vraiment pas plaisant.
I already miss the summer :(...
what do we win !!!!!
Curious what the leaderboard looks like for meteorological summer (June 1 - Sept 1)
Coolest summer for the rest of our lives!
Damn in my country this is winter temperature. The biggest point about summer in Montreal this year seemed to be the fact it was over 30¬∞C for so many days.
Records are meant to be broken üòé
Wait a minute. I want to hear what u/YUL-Weather-Records has to say about this. Can we really trust what u/YOW-Weather-Records has to say about Montreal weather records?
Mais kesski c‚Äôest pass√© √† l‚Äô√©t√© 1941?
Bruh........
This reminds me why I never want to go back to Montreal‚Ä¶
Demand more climate action from the federal government.  Climate neutrality by 2030 is not enough. We need climate negativity or we are fucked. Or, get used to it getting hotter and hotter‚Ä¶
Hmm... initially I thought this would be due to global warming, but there are no other top-10 summers since records moved to the airport in 1941. So maybe this is more of a fluke.
The airport's probably cooler since there's less built environment nearby and more green space.
Edit: What's with the downvotes?
Keep it quiet, Trudeau will raise the f'n carbon tax!
Ah so that's why everybody was celebrating on St. Catherine today! They did seem super excited about warming.
But this is not a competition where you want to be number 1. Lol
Hey, question for all you montrealers - have the leaves started to turn significantly yet?
I was hoping to come visit (fully vaccinated) durinf peak leaves this year, and didn‚Äôt know whether I should hook for mid October or the first week in November.
With it being such a hot summer, did it seemingly push the autumn leaf turn back?
Just give it some years and if you are a good redditor, global warming fairy might grant your wishes!
You'd have a constantly muddy winter with no snow... why would you want that?
Soon
careful what you wish for
if its like the past 2 years we wont see snow until mid jan.
Where the global warming goes on winter? Florida?
[deleted]
Just be glad the detailed records don't go back to 1816.  Montreal froze solid and several large snowstorms during that summer.
July was cooler than usual and actually quite nice (give me  24-26 degrees all day every day in summer!). August was horrible tho.
Il revient l'an prochain ‚òÄÔ∏è
Higher A/C bills.
I was actually gonna ask what definition of summer it's using. Did I miss it, it doesn't specify in the infographic?
You can find that type of information in /r/MontrealWxRecords
I bet next summer will be cooler.
"Sorry, nobody on Reddit goes by that name."
Average night temperatures are climbing all across Canada (including Montreal).  I would say that it's a fluke that this table does NOT show it.
GOOD
It is just barely starting in the Eastern Townships. Usually for the Southern part of the province, aim for the 1st week of October, up to and including Thanksgiving (Canadian Thanksgiving).
Last week it started in the eastern township when I passed though . Haven‚Äôt really started yet in MTL. Not sure but it must have started in the Laurentides and further North. November is too late. Usually there barely any leaves in trees at Halloween. Depending on where you want to go in the first 2 weeks of October / mid october are closer to peak colors. A little bit earlier further north or late further South. Colors don‚Äôt last that long.  You should post in the Quebec Subbredit to ask about the colors in the specific region you plan to visit.
Also, more bugs ‚Äòcause no freezing to kill them‚Ä¶ no thanks‚Ä¶
A variation of 1-2¬∞ is considered large and can have a huge impact, you obviously still eat all types of animal products and use plastic cups cause why not wouhouuuu
Were there links to any particular global phenomenon around the time like a volcano or anything?
At YUL, this was the coldest July in 12 years, but it was very sharply (and interestingly) surrounded by the hottest June in recorded history (tied with June 2005), and the hottest August on record.
Ben, c'est pas necessaire ;)
I have a problem with air conditioning on principle. Ok, I understand we live in hydro-electric land, but when you're roasting hot, isn't burning even more energy to make yourself comfortable exactly the wrong thing to do?
Psyke! I don't even *have* an AC
:'(
In general, meteorological borders are utilized for most comparisons (even though my personal preference is the astronomical boundaries of seasons).
Regardless of the definition adopted (i.e. meteorologically or astronomically) in this case, the record presented here would satisfy both, at least if considering only YUL. This is simply because this was the first time at YUL that the first 22-23 days of September also never fell below 9.0 C for a minimum.
I would exercise caution, however, when combining datasets from two different locations for the sake of extending a historical record. This is because both the McGill/McTavish and YUL stations are located in different areas and undoubtedly have slightly different climates (one in the city and the other farther West of there, in the subsurbs within a large open area). Doing so can introduce data inhomogeneities and, therefore, produce spurious trends.  It is, therefore, in my opinion, best and safer to keep comparisons to a single station/location over the time period that is available. If data from a new station needs to be used over time (which can become necessary for a plethora of reasons), then station selection should be determined based on the location of the previous station for more consistent analyses. Anyhow, just my friendly advice and something to consider for future endeavors! :)
For this post, I'm using astronomical seasons.

Montreal is not nearly full enough to necessitate this height of buildings. Upping the height of other areas first makes more sense then building ultra tall towers for the wealthy. More 10 story apartment buildings would be faster to build then a mega tower. And more expansion to the east and densifying the West Island now that the REM will ease transport issues
Wait, is Coderre against this rule? Because it's a very good rule.
Ce qui est un peu chiant avec ce r√®glement, c'est que √ßa commence √† affecter n√©gativement la silhouette du skyline de Montr√©al, depuis 4-5 ans, √©tant donn√© que les nouveaux gratte-ciel "top" tous la limite permise au centre-ville (ce qu'on voyait pas auparavant √† cause de la morosit√© √©conomique de Montr√©al pr√©-2010). √áa commence √† se voir clairement √† l'ouest du boulevard Ren√©-Levesque avec plusieurs tours c√¥te √† c√¥te qui ont exactement la m√™me hauteur, soit le maximum qui est de 120m √† cet endroit.
C'est juste... laitte. √áa d√©fait la silhouette en escalier "smooth" qu'on veut justement donner au centre-ville et qui est agr√©able au regard. Pis l√† on va commencer √† avoir le m√™me effet dans la zone o√π le 200m est permis, puisque dans les 2-3 derni√®res ann√©es il y a pr√®s de 10 tours de cette hauteur qui ont entam√© leur construction ou vont le faire bient√¥t (la tour de la BNC, projet Victoria sur le parc, le 1 square phillips, la tour en face de la place bonaventure, etc.).
Je dis pas de compl√®tement enlever les r√®glements de hauteur limite, mais pourquoi ne pas ajouter certains palliers de hauteurs (p. ex.: 250m au centre du downtown, 180m en p√©riph√©rie du downtown au lieu du 120m actuel) pour √©viter de se retrouver avec des effets de "plafond" de hauteur weird comme c'est litt√©ralement en train de se d√©velopper sous nos yeux?
Val√©rie Plante pourrait m√™me sauver la face en permettant certaines d√©rogations de hauteur en √©change d'une plus grande proportion de logement sociaux et sous condition d'une architecture signature. Litt√©ralement tout le monde serait gagnant. 
Pis l'argument de "√ßa bloque la vue sur le mont-royal"......... Gimme a break. La vue du Mont-Royal est d√©j√† bloqu√©e avec le r√®glement actuel. Ce qu'il faut pr√©server, ce sont les corridors de vue, comme par exemple celui de la rue McGill College.
> We have to stop seeing the city as a mosaic of neighbourhoods stuck together 
Says everything you need to know about this guy. One of, if not the most cherished trait of Montreal is nothing but a hindrance to his idea of "dreaming big." This thinking is a relic of city planning that places developers' profits and grandiose ego projects over the quality of life of the common citizen. A trend which we need to do all we can to put in the past.
&#x200B;
You don't need massive ego projects and condo hellscapes to have an "ambitious city." We should be ambitious in other ways which actually benefit the people of Montreal.
I saw the headline and went "yeah, sounds cool, great"
Then I saw OP having a jolly old time arguing the opposite in the thread. That's a lifestyle choice I guess. Like I get that we post headlines as they are, but you have to expect people will have differing views from you...
Je pense que c'est √† courte vue. Si nous voulons lutter contre l'√©talement urbain, nous devons augmenter la densit√© en rempla√ßant les b√¢timents existants par des gratte-ciel.
Some people here talk as if eliminating height restrictions would lower housing prices.    
The reality is we can already build pretty high in downtown, the only difference this would make is that now you'd have a huge Sony tower visible from everywhere, casting a shadow over several blocks, only to fill some corporate vanity project.  
If these towers were to be residential ones, they'd be luxury condos only a few select would be able to afford. None of you would live there, just look at how cheap Manhattan is as an example...    
Instead we should be advocating for mid density in our suburbs, and for the elimination of single family dwelling zoning in newer neighborhoods.
I think rules like this are well-intentioned but wind up being used in as a cudgel to squash changes people don't like regardless of whether or not that change is valid.
I also think it winds up being kind of arbitrary. Height is flashy and can be iconic or derided or whatever, but if a building is well-intergraded at street level, the height becomes kind of a background

I have no issues with building taller than Mount Royal, especially if it were to increase the supply of housing among different socio-economic groups.
Pourquoi on parle de √ßa, seulement le centre-ville, quand presque partout ailleurs √† Montr√©al c'est limit√© √† 3 √©tages m√™me au-dessus des stations de m√©tro. Il est l√† le probl√®me de l'√©talement urbain et de la crise du logement.
C'est absurde de penser construire plus haut au centre-ville des tours √† bureau avec la r√©forme du t√©l√©travail et quand c'est de plus en plus impossible pour les travailleurs dans ces tours de se loger sur l'√Æle.
Wasn't this rule originally set into place with the idea that nothing can go higher than the cross on the mountain because something something religion has to be on top?
>nd we oppose any attempt to block the view of Mount Royal
Tel qu'expliqu√© ET d√©montr√© dans l'autre post, ce n'est pas la hauteur des tour qui bloque la vue du Mont Royal, c'est leur emplacement. C'est un des r√©glements les plus stupide en existance, et ca dit quelque-chose.
Edit: Est-ce quun peut amener Valerie Plante sur la rive sud et lui montrer que meme avec la hauteur permise, visuellement ca cache le Mont-Royal?
[https://imgur.com/a/RdCOK7W](https://imgur.com/a/RdCOK7W)
When this wasn't a Projet Montreal talking point, everyone was in favor of abolishing the height limit. This sub is so fickle and stupid.
I think this is a bad policy, and here's why, briefly. 
First of all, this limits the density of habitations. Taller buildings can accommodate more people and use less space. More habitation buildings would make for cheaper rent in a moment where that's exactly what we need! With rent and housing prices increasing all over Canada and in Montr√©al, apartment towers would be welcome.
Secondly, allowing for taller buildings and therefore denser population would restraint urban sprawling. Right now, people move out from the city to pay for cheaper apartments and houses, but with a denser population in the midst of the city there would be more apartment available for cheaper rent, and therefore there would be a weaker pressure for urban sprawl.
That's about it for me really, I think those are quite rational arguments. I know there are other kinds of arguments, like that it would ruin the city's charm and skyline and such, but those are more subjective and arguable... Like, how much more rent per month should inhabitants of the city pay so that tourists and people from other cities can appreciate the city's charm and "small city" appearance? I'd much rather bring down rent and limit the spread of urban regions.
Plante's resistance to this, and Montreal's general anti-skyscraper attitude is very much emblematic of our collective 'think small' attitude. While I'm open to some height restrictions - let's be real: Montreal will never be Hong Kong, New York, or Shanghai. We are fortunate in the sense to have a "mountain" smack in the middle of the city centre, and that should be cherished. I am however, totally against a blanket max height restriction on the city as a whole. You very well could have a few designated 250/300M lots & establish architectural criteria to maximize the views to Mount Royal. If positioned properly, these would allow our city centre to increase in density, but also protect our cherished mountain. It's common to build 300-400M skyscrapers these days. Land values are quite expensive and developers want to maximize the use of their space, thus building taller. Infrastructure is expensive - why spend all this money installing sewers, electricity, REM stations if the central area isn't used to it max capacity? Let's face it too, there is a certain prestige in building tall for major companies and architects. It's a certain handicap for Montreal if a company is considering building its headquarters here but is told whatever they build can't exceed the mountain whereas in Toronto just down the road, major companies are headquarted in 200+M highrises. Isn't it a bit collectively embarassing for Montrealers that the 'true' head office of the Bank of Montreal is located a) not in Montreal and b) in a ~300M building right in the middle of Toronto's financial district?
I have to say I really like Coderres vision. He wants to put montreal back on the map and I‚Äôm all for it. Plante √† une belle vision pour la ville, mais je pense que Coderre a une ambition plus en ligne avec ce dont la ville a besoin
Can someone explain how 1 Square Phillips is allowed ? 66 stories is way higher no?
Il y a un quasi consensus chez les urbanistes √† ce sujet, prot√©ger la vue sur le Mont Royal est essentiel pour assurer l‚Äôunicit√© de la ville, tous les Montr√©alais devrait poss√©der le droit √† cette vue.
On devrait prendre la terre utilis√©e dans les chantiers de construction et la domper sur le mont royal. √ätre contre la croissance verticale est d'une stupidit√© incroyable.

Such pledge, much wow.
Pour √©viter √† des personnes de monter sur le toit d'un building qui serait super haut et avoir la t√™te direct dans le smug.
√áa ne sert √† rien d'avoir un vue de la montagne s'il rend la ville inabordable
This is already a rule. No?
Imagine your apartment is so high the light on top of place ville-Marie shines in your living room!
The prime example of thinking that ‚Äú√©chelle humaine‚Äù is a synonym for low height is Griffintown.
Having buildings build at currently double the height in Griffintown would not have changed the feeling of the neighbourhood at all - but would have increased population, spurned additional services & could have been used as a bargaining chip to demand affordable housing.
Limiting the height results in lower quality architecture and only local builders (ie Devimco) developing the market as the potential for profit becomes too small. So you are left with low-rise, high cost, no architectural integrity....as all builders pinch every dollar to run profit.
Compare that to Toronto where BIG, Gehry and other world renowned architects are designing buildings.
Additional concentrating population in core is amazing for the environment as the carbon footprint associated with travel is greatly redu ed
In a perfect world, we could have low rise - beautifully designed building with 25% reserved for social/affordable housing. However, we do not live in this imaginary world & the current admin refuses to take a pragmatic approach to find a solution to these issues. All based on a principled stance that doesn‚Äôt care about finding actual solutions.
When you are in the downtown core, having a building at 200m or 300m has literally zero impact on any view of Mont Royal....the views are already established running North/South (ex view from McGill College) & these views will never be impacted no matter how high you build
We need a better skyline. Not necessarily taller buildings, but more well designed buildings (and getting rid of eyesores of possible) is necessary
Je vois beaucoup de commentaire contre la hausse de hauteur en critiquant diff√©rente raison, mais jamais celle-ci :
(Note : Je ne suis pour ou contre, √ßa d√©pend et si la limite est monter un jours, ce devra √™tre bien fait et contr√¥ler, seulment dans une petite zone, avec des batisse de qualit√© et qui amiliore le paysage urbain.) et on parle de passer de 200 √† 250 environ, pas des 400 - 500m
L'une des principale raison de monter la limite qui est valable √† mon avis est le fait que montr√©al va atteindre un plateau de 200m. Ce n'√©tait pas un probl√®me il y  juste 5 ans et le probl√®me n'est pas encore visible.Jusqu'en 2016, il n'y avait que 5 gratte-ciel √† environ 200m. En se moment il y en √† 1 seul de plus (Tour l'avenue (une beat√© √† mon avis)), mais en se moment il y en a 6 en construction.Donc en 10 ans on sera passer de 5 √† 12 qui atteingne environ 200m et Montr√©al risque de ressembler √† un bloc.
Donc d'augmenter un peu au centre de la ville la limite permettrait d'obtenir un effet de montagne et non un mur de gratte-ciel.

Bon, j'aime pas l'id√©e d'enlever cette limite, mais je ne suis pas capable de ne pas faire l'avocat du diable.Les hauteurs apportent de l'Attractivit√© √† l'international pour certaines firmes ou pour la possibilit√© d'avoir plusieurs acteurs diff√©rents au sein d'une m√™me tour.

What a stupid rule... and this is why real estate is going up.
This is really stupid, but at the same time smart, Montreal‚Äôs infrastructure can not handle such tall buildings, traffic/transit is already really bad and concentrating people in place will just make it worst, better to spread people out, there‚Äôs the whole island and surrounding areas, everyone does not need to be downtown.
Can we throw her onto a soft bouncy surface and move on?

La limite √† Montr√©al est le Mont-Royal OU 200 m√®tres, la plus petite de ces deux mesures. Depuis le premier r√®glement d'urbanisme des ann√©es 90. 
Denis Coderre a parl√© de retirer cette limite derni√®rement.
Mayor Tremblay removed the protections right before leaving office. He permitted constructions up to 40 storeys then resigned 3 months later.

Super int√©ressant et sur le sujet en g√©n√©ral de la construction et d√©veloppement immobilier √† Montr√©al.
Exactly, tax land and watch the efficiency increase. For example many of the tarmac car-parks in downtown could easily be replaced by a few multi-storey ones and the rest used to add office capacity.
Great point. No need for residential skyscrapers yet. 8-10 story apartment buildings located on wide streets, near subway stations and amenities would be perfect.  
With decent public transportation in the east, we could also densify there (right now the public transports are horrible).
On one hand I generally think "view protection" and similar laws are nonsense and there's no compelling reason to block these towers if someone wants to build them. The threat of *seeing a building you dislike* is not a nuisance worth regulating.
But on the other hand I think skyscrapers are mostly a distraction in the housing discussion, and aren't a structural solution to shortages. What we really need is, like you alluded, more *consistent* midrise density in more places, particularly those with metro/REM service. So I don't think loosening the existing height regulation is worth putting up a big political fight, compared to some of the other more productive goals we could work towards.
Par contre, pas de probl√®me √† payer des loyers de 1800$ pour un 2 1/2?
> building ultra tall towers for the wealthy.
It may sound backwards but having luxury aparments in these super tall towers would be healthy for the city in the long run, as it would relieve a lot of pressure on the current real estate situation. Rich people would move downtown in those brand new units instead of increasing the price of apartments in more remote parts of the city.
It's crazy we're even having this debate. The skyscraper is an obsolete form of architecture and anyone who pays attention even a little bit to today's conversations on architecture and urbanism would know that. They're extremely expensive, extremely hard to maintain, are rarely a reflection of the community culture, and are far worse for livability than almost any other building form save for maybe big box stores. 
They're also completely unjustifiable when there is such an [absurd amount of wasted space in this city](https://imgur.com/a/GFdhoQr).
Remember this: Paris (with the exception of la Defense) has essentially no buildings taller than 6 stories, and yet they achieve an average density of over 20k people per square km. Montreal, in contrast, is 890 people per square km. That's literally 22 times less dense.
So long as we continue to have dumb patches of grass in places no one wants to be, boulevards that have 6 more lanes than they actually need, entire swaths of land dedicated to big box stores and corresponding parking lots, and cloverleaf interchanges in the middle of the city, skyscrapers are a huge waste of time and probably a significant step backward.

So, you want to keep the poor people living in the West and East while reserving the view of Mont Royal for the rich and keep the city less dense than a block in Dhaka?
Yeah. Sounds like a NIMBY.
He‚Äôs in developers‚Äô pockets
Why is this a good rule? It seems arbitrary. You already can't see the mountain in most of the city. Where I live a three-story building is tall enough to block it.
Somebody need to care a out thoes poor millionnaire  developer.
It is a terrible rule that will depress the housing stock in Montreal. We need to build more and build higher apartment complexes.

L'accent de l'√©cole publique de Montr√©al : arabohaitienlatinoquebecois
Quand j'avais le d√©but de la vingtaine, pendant les ann√©es 80, j'avais remarqu√© qu'il y avait au moins 3 mani√®res de prononcer Montr√©al, pour les gens qui y vivaient en fran√ßais.
Je venais de Cartierville, mes amis et moi nous prononcions:
MON R√â AL
Mes cousins de Montr√©al-Nord pronon√ßaient:
MON RIAL
Ma blonde de Villeray et sa famille disaient:
MOH R√âAL avec le MOH prononc√© comme le "m'a" dans "m'a te casser la yeule."
Damn. I thought this was going to be a thread about Hyundais and instead I learned some shit.
Je suis originaire de la Mauricie au Qu√©bec, et demeure maintenant √† Mtl depuis plus d‚Äôun an. Honn√™tement, je n‚Äôai jamais √©t√© autant d√©pareill√© tout en restant dans ma langue natale. Des emprunts √† la prononciation, en passant par les expressions... je n‚Äôarrive toujours pas √† croire que par moments, je parle √† un francophone montr√©alais et nous avons de la difficult√© √† se comprendre. 
De la C√¥te-Nord √† l‚ÄôAbitibi, en passant par la Mauricie et la Gasp√©sie, j‚Äôai √©galement pu observer ce ph√©nom√®ne. Par contre, n‚Äôimporte qui associerait sans mis√®re au dialecte Qu√©b√©cois qui est *tr√®s diff√©rent* du Montr√©alais. √áa √©voque beaucoup sur l‚Äôensemble de la culture.
Ce qui est m√©connu de l‚Äôaccent Qu√©b√©cois, c‚Äôest qu‚Äôil tire ses origines l‚Äôaccent de la Monarchie fran√ßaise (et non le parler populaire, comme est per√ßu aujourd‚Äôhui l‚Äôaccent Qu√©b√©cois) √† l‚Äô√©poque de la colonisation de la Nouvelle-France. La France a perdu cet accent suite aux R√©volutions o√π le peuple s‚Äôest impos√©.
J‚Äôai remarqu√© un Fran√ßais beaucoup plus neutre chez les Montr√©alais issus de communaut√©s plus favoris√©es, qui ne s‚Äôapproche ni du Qu√©b√©cois ni du Fran√ßais (de France). D‚Äôun autre c√¥t√©, je remarque une tr√®s pi√®tre qualit√© du Fran√ßais parl√© et √©crit chez beaucoup de gens issus de communaut√©s moyenne ou d√©favoris√©es. Cela me pr√©occupe particuli√®rement, car la d√©gradation est exponentielle.
J‚Äôai moi-m√™me eu la remarque d‚Äôavoir d√©velopp√© un accent diff√©rent de ma ville natale, sans m‚Äôen √™tre rendu compte. L‚Äôhumain est particuli√®rement sujet √† √™tre influenc√© par sa communaut√©, et plus la communaut√© est grande, plus son effet sera important.
J‚Äôadore la langue fran√ßaise et suis particuli√®rement fier de faire partie du seul petit groupe d‚ÄôAm√©rique qui parle cette langue. Je suis pr√©occup√© par son avenir et j‚Äôesp√®re fortement une meilleure prise de conscience.
There was a a thread on here.... at some point that went into great details about most popular slang expressions and their origin. It was pretty interesting since a lot of subcultures has their own language/dialect/slang and then has its set of shared slang expression in the popular vocab...  can't find it though =/
There are a couple of different English accents also. St-L√©onard English is very different to Hampstead/Cote St-Luc which is different to Griffintown/ point saint Charles.
Ce qui me fait plaisir aussi, c'est que nous voyons cette diversit√© d'accents comme une richesse (j'ai l'impression qu'en France, un accent qui n'est pas Parisien est vu comme un handicap, ou quelque chose de rigolo qu'il faut changer pour sonner cr√©dible)
La moiti√© des enfants dans mon quartier (Mile-End/Outremont) ont des parents fran√ßais de France, et ils ont tous un accent hybride France-Qu√©bec. 
En tant qu'anglophone qui a grandi hors Qu√©bec, j'aime beaucoup qu'il y ait une telle diversit√© d'accents √† Montr√©al. √áa fait que je ne suis pas trop g√™n√© de parler avec un bizarre d'accent anglo-montr√©alo-qu√©b√©cois.
J'adore √ßa et je suis attach√©e √† ces accents.
Beaucoup ldes commentaires des gens qui ne viennent pas de Montr√©al semblent avoir des points de vue n√©gatives sur l'existence d'une vari√©t√© de communaut√© culturelle. Je peut comprendre. Le fran√ßais de Montr√©al a ses particularit√©s.
Le cor√©en parl√© des ann√©es 80 et maintenant est diff√©rent. L'anglais change de pays en pays. Oui, je suis consciente que ce n'est pas la m√™me situation que la langue fran√ßaise a au Canada. 
Si on veut parler d'augmenter la qualit√© d'√©ducation dans nos √©coles et favoriser l'apprentissage de la langue fran√ßaise avec des cr√©dits d'imp√¥ts pour les compagnies qui offrent des cours de fran√ßais √† leur employ√©s (qu'ils soient 10 ou 5000) et avoir plus de programme de francisation et injecter de l'argent dans le m√©dia francophone - je suis partante et je vote pour. La loi 101 m'a donner le cadeau du trilinguisme. √áa m'a permis de vivre des exp√©riences unique et mind-blowing. 
Je dois admettre d'√™tre quand-m√™me un peu √©coeurer d'entendre les gens qui ne viennent pas de Montr√©al chier sur les montr√©alais divers qui ont des accents, m√™me s'il y en a pas beaucoup qui le font. Les critiques et le partage des perspectives diff√©rent sont le bienvenu par contre. Faut apprendre!
Un accent √ßa veut juste dire que la personne parle une autre langue que le fran√ßais et que cette personne est en train d'apprendre. Il y a une histoire qui existe derri√®re nos accents. √áa parle du fait que certains gens ont traverser le monde, laissant derri√®re la famille, les amis et des points de r√©f√©rence pour venir s'installer au Qu√©bec pour donner des meilleurs opportunit√© pour leurs enfants. C'est quand-m√™me vraiment un grand compliment.
Mes madames et mononc' de tout les deps que j'ai √©t√© avaient des accents vari√©. Non, ces gens l√† qui travaillaient 70 heures par semaines ne parlent pas bien le fran√ßais. Dans un monde id√©al ils pourraient faire mieux, mais c'est vraiment pas √©vident d'√©tudier quand t'a immigrer et en plus tu dois gagner des sous. 
Mes amis, des r√©fugi√©s/immigr√©s de Bosnie, d'Ha√Øti et du Cambodge et moi parlons tous le fran√ßais. La loi 101, √ßa a march√©.
Montr√©al est une belle ville (m√™me si d√©fois √ßa fait vraiment chier et il y a des choses tellement frustrant et fucked qui se passe aussi) en partie a cause de sa diversit√© et les gens aiment vivre ici.
Mon pr√©f√©r√© est le fran√ßais vietnamien et cantonais. A cause de mon association √† la bonne bouffe lol. Mais le bon jouale aussi c'est familier. Surtout le jouale des grands maman.
I heard an interesting piece on CBC about how in earlier times there was a difference in French accents. If you drew a vertical line line in the map of Quebec though Sorel, to the east most people would trill their R's but to the west most would not. Also they played some parts of speeches of important persons( a Premier and priest I think) , they would also trill their R's. 
This was around 1930's, so things have changed I expect?
J'ai toujours consid√©r√© le franglais comme √©tant l'accent typiquement montr√©alais mais c'est vrai que c'est assez r√©ducteur en consid√©rant le multiculturalisme de la m√©tropole
Il y a m√™me une diff√©rence entre comment les anglo montrealais\e prononce Montreal (munt-tree-al) et comment les non montr√©alais anglophone le ditent (maunt-ree-all) comme haunt dans haunted house. C'est une petite diff√©rence que je trouve gossant comme anglo qu√©b√©cois :P
Moi, je te sugg√®re la page [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_English) sur l‚Äôanglais Qu√©b√©cois.
One of my favourite parts of language in the city is how there are French expressions that just work better than the English equivalent. I work with a bunch of Americans, and will occasionally drop a Montrealism that doesn‚Äôt make any sense to them. 
This early in the morning before coffee, I‚Äôm having trouble thinking of some other than ‚Äúdep‚Äù...

Ever notice how most English non-Montrealers (from the states, or the rest of Canada) pronounce Montreal as Mawn-treee-aall. Grinds my gears.
Republie √©galement sur r/Francophonie STP ! :)
Il y a plein d'accents en anglais aussi!
Et moi qui croyait qui √©tait le seule a avoir remarqu√© √ßa lol
j'en suis ben aise :-)
In Cotes-des-Neiges, everyone speaks in a hybrid of African/Haitien/Quebecois french. Even the asians (can confirm).
MON-RIAL for me in French 
And I feel like I alternate between MUN/MON TREE ALL in English

Bien dit et m√™me entre ¬´Montr√©alais¬ª, je suis n√© √† Montr√©al mais √† Rivi√®res-des-Prairies, ce qui dans les ann√©es 60 et 70 √©tait la campagne, rien √† voir avec aujourd‚Äôhui et ma famille avait une ferme jusqu‚Äôau ann√©es 30 dans ce qui est maintenant Mercier pr√®s de Mtl-est... rien √† voir avec le Plateau ou Villeray, campagnard d‚Äôorigine mais Montr√©alais lol... mais il ne faut pas exag√©rer, j‚Äôai visit√© partout au Qu√©bec et que ca soit Sept-ile, Carleton ou Amos, y‚Äôa pas d‚Äôendroit ou je n‚Äôai pas compris ce qu‚Äôun autre Qu√©b√©cois disait....
Dans ma famille, on appelle cet accent neutre montrealais l'accent Radio-Canada. Bref c'est quand t'essais de sonner comme Bernard Derome! Surtout vu dans les familles aisees d'Outremont, du plateau et de rosemont.

Laval Italian kids english
I actually studied this in a sociolinguistics class I took at ConU. Montreal English is unique because we're surrounded by French so there's less opportunity to adhere to the standard English. The majority of 20-30 YO Italians may be third-generation, but because they only spoke English with family & friends (often also Italian), they kept their accent rather than assimilating. 
If you compare a third-generation (heck even some 2nd generation) Francos they'll be much closer to the standard Montreal French because they were not so isolated.
Yep...The hampstead, CSL, NDG english accent has more Jewish influence while the west island is more waspy...anglos in the pointe under 70 are hard to find though.
I wish I could hear the differences! In english, I can only perceive strong obvious accents, such as british, southern, indian etc.  
I would still love to hear more about that.
As a foreign Anglophone I always found the Montreal Anglo English accents somewhat unusual and fascinating.
nan les parisiens sont juste pretentieux
Wow!
The rolled rs is a thing you can still hear from people old enough to have been taught in catholic schools.
It‚Äôs the second time I hear that, and I can‚Äôt keep myself from laughing. It‚Äôs a fair observation actually! I‚Äôm from the country 3h from Montreal, and native French speaker with a quite bold Qu√©b√©cois accent. The reason I think this is funny is because most people who thrill their R‚Äôs do so because of age... not because other people do it. I dare you to find anyone thrilling their R‚Äôs below 50yo. I just find this very funny since to us Qu√©b√©cois it‚Äôs absolutely obvious, but I do agree I would expect it to be an accent.
You've got it backwards. Traditionally, it's the west of the province that trilled the Rs, at least up to the 70s-80s. It's a typical feature of the old Montr√©al accent, though you don't hear it often anymore, at least not in young people.
In this documentary about the FLQ, people are trilling their Rs [https://www.onf.ca/film/rose-les/](https://www.onf.ca/film/rose-les/) the footages were from the 70s (maybe some in the 80s too)
It was still a thing until the 50s! However, I‚Äôd like to point out that it was in the west that rolled the r‚Äôs, not the east!
My mom is from Lotbini√®re and even after living in Montreal for 40 years she still as a distinct way to trill her R and her U that is apparently very typical from where she was born (knowing her all my life I don't hear as much an accent as my mom's voice)
I think it also has to do with the presence of english speakers. Trilling Rs isn't something that is done in english, but is in french, and most english speakers live on the west points of the island. Those who are exposed to more english might be less prone to roll their Rs, while someone exposed to the more "pure" french on the east side of the island would be more likely to.
Le franglais peut √™tre consid√©r√© comme un accent, mais aussi comme une image dans le temps de la lente anglicisation des qu√©b√©cois. Je pr√©f√®re m'int√©resser √† l'accent d'un anglophone en fran√ßais, qu'au fran√ßais d'un quebecois qui doit avoir recours √† l'anglais pour palier son manque de vocabulaire. Cependant, il s'agit d'un ph√©nom√®ne bien r√©el assez int√©ressant en soit, et source d'identit√© pour plusieurs montr√©alais, alors qui suis-je pour juger
Laccent typique d‚Äôoutremont est tr√®s different de l‚Äôaccent typique de rdp!

The 58th Grey Cup was played on November 28, 1970, before 32,669 fans at CNE Stadium at Toronto. The Montreal Alouettes defeated the Calgary Stampeders 23‚Äì10. The game was marred by woeful field conditions, as throughout the contest several sections of the natural-grass surface came away in chunks.

S'il s'√©tait juste excus√© humblement d'avoir consult√© son t√©l√©phone, √ßa aurait fini l√†. Mais on ne change pas si facilement. Il s'ent√™te sur un fait relativement banal (c'est mal, mais ts√© tout le monde fait des erreurs de temps en temps), et c'est en train de lui faire une tonne de tord. Un tel article qui rappelle avec raison ses mensonges n'auraient probablement pas exist√© s'il s'√©tait juste excus√© d'avoir regard√© son t√©l√©phone sur un feu rouge. Et cet article est un vrai coup de masse pour lui et sa campagne.
Quelle dr√¥le de bataille √† mener de la part de Denis Coderre, de risquer son √©lection. Juste pour pas dire ¬´m'escuse¬ª.
Ts√©, on ne parlera plus jamais de Plante qui √©tait √† 4 sur une terrasse. Parce qu'elle s'est juste excus√©e. On passe √† autre chose.
Je ne suis pas fan de Plante, mais je suis encore moins fan de Coderre.  Je crois que je vais voter pour Plante, juste parce qu'elle parait moins (d√©sol√© mais le mot en fran√ßais m'√©chappe) "sleeze".
Denis est pr√™t √† mentir en tout temps. On ne peut pas avoir confiance dans ses paroles creuses. S√©rieusement, √ßa fait 40 ans qu‚Äôil fait √ßa, on peux-tu passer √† autre chose.
J‚Äôesp√®re tellement qu‚Äôil ne sera pas maire de Montr√©al.
Un d√©veloppeur immobilier du nom de Rizzuto qui fait un don de $25,000 √† Coderre, c'est fucking suspect.
M√™me si le monsieur est honn√™te, autant honn√™te qu'on peut √™tre quand on est d√©veloppeur immobilier, **donner** de l'argent √† titre personnel √† un gars qui a √©t√© Maire et qui pourrait √™tre encore Maire de la ville o√π Rizzuto fait des affaires c'est pas juste suspect, √ßa devrait √™tre un crime.
TLPL: Denis Coderre est un menteur pathologique.
La mafia est tann√©e, il veulent recommencer √† traire la Ville.
C'est surtout que Coderre nous prend pou des esti de caves. S√©rieux...
C'est quand m√™me tout un contraste avec la r√©action de Plante avec l'√©pisode de la terrasse. Elle me s'est pas d√©fil√©e et a imm√©diatement reconnu son tort. De l'autre c√¥t√© on voit Coderre qui tente de nier et d'esquiver la question.
C‚Äôest la premi√®re fois que je vois un article de La Presse avec des r√©f√©rences bibliographiques.
C‚Äôest s√ªrement une exception, mais j‚Äôai toujours esp√©r√© que les journaux adoptent ce niveau de rigueur.
D'habitude, les articles de journalistes qui creusent pour trouver des bobos √† des candidats politiques en p√©riode √©lectorale, √ßa m'√©nerve.
Cet article-ci est un bon travail journalistique. C'est pas des bobos que Lagac√© d√©crit, c'est un portrait d'une partie de la personalit√© et des valeurs d'un candidat.
√áa serait bien d'avoir un article du m√™me calibre sur Mme Plante.

Tout ca est vrai je me permet de rajouter:
1) ''mon'' chef de police dans le pass√© ==> jappelle le ministre de la sant√© quand mes parents sont pas capable de reserver leur spot et je m'en vente sur twitter
2) J'appelle ''mon'' chef de police, c'est sur ma carte de credit a √©t√© vol√©e ==> mon fils a une d√©pendance a l'internet (traduction: mon fils a pay√© des escortes/onlyfans/webcam ou autres) mais pas de couilles de l'admettre.

perdre du poids ne change pas l'homme
Il √©tait grandement temps que quelqu'un en parle. Coderre a toujours √©t√© comme √ßa et il ne va jamais √™tre autre chose que lui m√™me soit un menteur autoritaire assoiff√© de pouvoir et sans aucune vision pour notre belle ville.
Probably the most unnecessary scandal I've ever seen. "Sorry everyone. No excuses, I take responsibility and have paid the fine. This won't happen again."
Peut-on trouver un alternatif √† Coderre ou Plante? SVP?
Anyone but Plante and she will lose badly, trust me.
H√¢te √† son retour.
This is true for 100% of politicians. No exceptions.
Deux hit piece sur Coderre en une semaine sur Reddit? Is this what we‚Äôre doing now? 
Edit: Worth noting almost all of the first comments (so far) in comment threads come from accounts 3 years old, close to the time of the first election.
Edit 2: lots of traction on this for a post less than an hour old
"Comme bien des gens, j'ai eu le r√©flexe de regarder mon t√©l√©phone en entendant sonner mon avis de message, m√™me si je sais que cela est dangereux (m√™me √† l'arret) et interdit par la loi. J'ai pay√© mon amende et pris mes points d'inaptitude. Je suis encore une fois d√©sol√©. Je sais que je peux et que je DOIS faire mieux."
Facile de m√™me. Pis demain, on n'en parlerait m√™me plus.
√áa en r√©v√®le beaucoup sur le personnage et son ego je trouve. Quand on le voit agir comme √ßa pour quelque chose d'aussi banal, on en viens a se demander comment il va r√©agir lorsque ce sera plus s√©rieux. J'ai vraiment pas envie d'avoir un Donald Trump comme maire de ma ville.
Il aurait juste pu dire de quoi de bidon comme "Scusez-moi, je mettais une adresse dans Google Maps, j'a appris ma le√ßon". C'√©tait litt√©ralement un non-enjeu qui est devenu une histoire √† cause de son √©go d√©mesur√©
On dirait Donald Trump qui voulait pas admettre qu'il y avait moins de monde a son inauguration. C'est pas vraiment important comme situation mais si il ment a propos de quelque chose de si banal, sa vas etre quoi pour des gros dossiers?
>Quelle dr√¥le de bataille √† mener de la part de Denis Coderre, de risquer son √©lection. Juste pour pas dire ¬´m'escuse¬ª.
Il a d√©j√† perdu une √©lection pas mal pour la m√™me raison, je vois pas pourquoi il changerait.
>Et cet article est un vrai coup de masse pour lui et sa campagne.
Pas vraiment, les gens sont habitu√©s aux campagnes de salissage pr√©-√©lections et n'y portent plus trop d'importance.
M√™me chose. Pas une m√©ga-fan de Plante, mais je voterais pour elle n'importe quand juste pour √©viter d'√©lire Coderre.
croche ?
Y'a ben des affaires que Val√©rie Plante a fait que chu pas n√©cessairement d'accord. Mais pour vrai dans l'ensemble je trouve qu'elle et son √©quipe on vraiment fait de Montr√©al une ville plus vivable pour les locaux.
Elle aime sa ville et √ßa para√Æt.
M√™me chose, assez d√©√ßu de Plante, que j'avais en haute estime, mais c'est pas Denis Coderre 2.0 qui va me convaincre de pas revoter pour elle.
Moi aussi. C'est pour √ßa que c'est important d'aller voter. M√™me aux √©lections municipales.
Rizzuto n'a pas un pass√© tr√®s honn√™te, il avait des liens serr√©s avec la mafia et des histoires de corruption

Coderre √©tait encore d√©put√© f√©d√©ral √† l'√©poque (2012). Il n'avait jamais √©t√© maire.

Ton commentaire est tr√®s neutre. 
Mentir pour bien para√Ætre comme l'a fait et le fait Coderre est un point n√©gatif pour quiconque dans la fonction publique. 
Coderre le Menteur ne m√©rite pas la confiance du public comme il le prouve encore et encore. Il est une valeur connue.
Plante est un autre sujet. S'il n'y a pas d'article √©quivalent √† son sujet, consid√®re que c'est potentiellement parce qu'elle n'en m√©rite pas.

Wtf happened in Ville-Marie LOL.
This is great. Merci beaucoup pour ca!!
I'd be curious to know what the averages are for NDG and CDN independently 
Also all other upscale areas are down except Westmount. Does that suggest more people buy in Westmount to invest i wonder.
Keep in mind that these %differences by borough are calculated on a very small number of data points (4-40 dewlings). If we were to look at the confidence intervals, I imagine we would see that much of the variation is likely due to random chance.
Holy fuck $880k median in the southwest? Did I buy the cheapest house in the borough??

Fran√ßais ci-dessous!
This only represents year over year stats showing mostly double digit increases across the board in all sales and prices. It does not show how the numbers have changed month by month. Please remember that it is in the best interest of real estate sales companies and home owners to demonstrate unstoppable growth. If the public thinks there is a chance of the real estate market declining, this could possibly result in a loss of sales/commision for the realtor and a loss of asset value for the owner.
If you dig just a little into the website (centris), you will find pdfs that show the stats in detail.
September 2020 [https://com.apciq.ca/sam/pdf/stats/2020/stats-202009-en.pdf](https://com.apciq.ca/sam/pdf/stats/2020/stats-202009-en.pdf)

You will see the following from the above pdfs that in Montreal between Sept and Nov 2020:
1. Condo Sales increase 3.5% (4% drop Oct to Nov)
2. Condo median price DROPPED (<1% change, 2% drop from Oct to Nov)
3. SFH Sales stagnant (< 1% increase, 8% drop from Oct to Nov)
4. SFH median price slowly increasing (1.1% increase)
5. Plex Sales increase 20% (6% drop Oct to Nov)
6. Plex median price increase 3% (stagnated <1% increase Oct to Nov)
I think it's important to review month by month realities, especially since it is still touch and go with the pandemic. These numbers represent to me expected seasonal changes (ie, the market stalling for late fall/winter).
The purpose of this post is to make it clear that the real estate market is not some unstoppable force and that their statistics risk being biased by self interest.
In my opinion, people will have to make a decision: continue to fuel a market that will result in a decreased quality of life due to increased housing prices/rent or create a more sustainable dynamic.
Thanks and miss seeing you all out and about!

Ca ne repr√©sentant que des statistiques d'une ann√©e sur l'autre montrant principalement des augmentations √† 10-20 % dans les nombres de ventes et prix moyennes. Il ne montre pas comment les chiffres ont chang√© de mois en mois. N'oubliez pas qu'il est dans le meilleur int√©r√™t des soci√©t√©s de vente immobili√®re et des propri√©taires de faire preuve d'une croissance imparable. Si le public pense qu'il y a un risque de d√©clin du march√© immobilier, cela pourrait √©ventuellement entra√Æner une perte de ventes / commission pour l'agent immobilier et une perte de valeur de l'avoir pour le propri√©taire.
Si on cherche un peu, on trouve les statistiques en plus de details.

On trouve qu'√† Montreal entre Sept et Nov 2020:
1. Ventes de condos a augment√© 3.5% (chute 4% Oct a Nov)
2. Condo prix moyenne chute (<1% difference, chute 2% de Oct a Nov)
3. SFH Sales est stagnant (< 1% increase, chute de 8% entre Oct et Nov)
4. SFH median price augment en ralentissant (Augment de 1.1%)
5. Ventes de Plex augment de 20% (chute 6% Oct a Nov)
6. Plex prix moyen augment 3% (stagnant entre Oct et Nov 2020 aug <1%)
Je pense qu'il est important de passer en revue les r√©alit√©s mois par mois, d'autant plus qu'elle est toujours en phase avec la pand√©mie. Ces chiffres repr√©sentent largement les changements saisonniers (ie. le march√© stagne √† la fin de l'automne / hiver).
Le but de cette affiche est de faire comprendre que le march√© immobilier n'est pas une force imparable et que les statistiques que les agences nous montrent risques d'√™tre biais√©s.
√Ä mon avis, les gens devront prendre une d√©cision: continuer √† alimenter un march√© qui se traduira par une diminution de la qualit√© de vie en raison de l'augmentation des prix des logements / loyers ou cr√©er une dynamique plus durable.
Merci :D
What‚Äôs happening in Ville Saint-Laurent and Baie D‚ÄôUrf√©? The price increases are quite high for 2019 vs. 2020!
Criss que √ßa fait peur
Les chiffres 2019 vs 2020 varient √©norm√©ment entre le mois d'octobre et le mois de novembre, ce qui montre que le volume de vente n'est pas assez √©lev√© pour avoir des chiffres statistiquement fiables au niveau des arrondissements, m√™me pour ceux avec le plus de vente.
Hello, 
I'm completely new to this, so please don't hurt me. 
But would it be possible to have a clarification as to if there is a standard "size" for "single-family home" (I assume it is a "standalone" house) and a Condo?
I mean, if I look at the chart, the most expensive condo was 4.4M, and the least expensive was 134.000$.  
But for all I know the 4.4M was a 8 1/2 (9000 ft^(2)) penthouse, while the 134.000$ one was a tiny studio.
It might not be relevant at all but I'm curious....
Where do you post these usually
Wow amazing!! Thank you for sharing. Very exciting to see our borough's median price go so high!
I know this might be a long shot but ideally, how much of a down payment should I be putting on a single family home in the 500000 range ?
+20% entre juste '19-'20 et $639,000 pour un maison cool cool cool

OP as-tu les stats d√©taill√©es de Montr√©al pour les plex ? Ce serait plus int√©ressant dans le contexte de la ville que les maisons unifamiliales.
The numbers are big and scary but not representative because since the summer 2020 there's been a huge increase of monetary supply. Basically, the government has devalued CAD for 15-20% after April 2020 (CPI will follow the assets in the next years I believe). That we already know and the comparisons to the years before the devaluation are nothing interesting anymore. Sep 2019 - Sep 2020, Oct-Oct, Nov-Nov, they will just be repeating every month until April.
More interesting would be to see the dynamics between sequential months. Are we still missing out or not anymore?
Ah yes, Millenial Lust  *‚Ñ¢*
Thanks for this! I moved from Toronto a few years back and there the situation for those who want to buy causes depression. Montreal is not so bad, but it's not as easy as people make it out to be. Crossing my fingers that I might actually buy next year. :(
Single family homes... √áa ne marche pas en milieu dense. Une maison unifamiliale x st adapt√© √† la campagne et la banlieue. Pas √† la ville. O√π est l'√©valuation du prix pour un logement de trois chambres??? Il n'y a pas que la taille d'une r√©sidence qui importe. Si c'√©tait le cas les immeubles a Montr√©al vaudraient moins qu'en banlieue....
Bless these insane sale prices. Sold my St Henri condo in November because demand is ridiculous.

r/coolguides
Il y a une facon de voir pour st lazare?
The numbers in each section are so low, it's very noisy.
That's nothing, three of the 12 houses in my road in the Laurentians have sold in the past two months, all for exorbitant prices.
That's just insane.... So much for our ridiculously high taxes keeping the cost of living lower.  I think if the cost of living is going to be this high then we should have lower taxes.  Clearly ...if I have to be taxed 25% by the province...then there's a fuck ton of wasteful spending going on... And it's not helping one bit when it comes to me trying to buy a house.
Why do you take so many cities in the West Island but not Longueuil or Laval which are closer to downtown?

Merci! Je prends toute les info d'une rapport par centris.

Faux chiffres √©videmment, mais tu vois l'id√©e ...
Condos are being offloaded by investors rn. Lots of supply and not alot of demand. I'd imagine that single family homes held speculatively are being off loaded as well
Il y en a quand-m√™me plusieurs √† Verdun. Quelques-uns sur Gordon par exemple (maisons en rang√©, duplexes convertis...), plusieurs proche du metro LaSalle et tout un voisinage unifamiliale pr√®s du Douglas.

For anyone complaining about how bad this will be - check out what the results of decriminalization of "quantities for personal-use" in Portugal.  TL;DR:  It massively reduced addiction and drug use by treating addiction as a medical issue, not a criminal issue.
yay go montreal, go
Cest la maniere d'aider les gens, j'ai vecu la dependance et puis avant de m'en sortir pour de bon avec une therapie fermee, je me suis retrouver a plusieurs reprises en prison.

Le but de tout cela est de vous expliquer, par mon experience personnelle, que la place d'une personne qui consomme n'est pas en prison mais en therapie !!! J'aurais pu gaspiller mon potentiel si je n'etais pas entour√© d'une si bonne famille: d'autres n'on pas cette chance !

Moi mon motto c'est vivre et laisser vivre. Si des gens veulent se droguer ca les regarde tant que c'est pas vendu a des mineurs.
Par contre avant de decriminaliser les drogues je crois qu'il serait important de decriminaliser le Sex Work. Attention ! Je parle ici de travailleurs/euses et clients/tes adultes et consentant. Bien sur les "pimps" qui recrutes des mineurs en prison et jeter la cle !

Super id√©e, √ßa a tellement bien tourn√© √† Seattle et SF, on devrait aussi l√©galiser le vol √† l‚Äô√©talage tant qu‚Äô√† y √™tre, on est en retard un peu
Those two things aren't mutually exclusive.
It will only work if drugs are legalized federally, if not drug addicts will flock to Montreal.
Did you went to Portugal recently ? I did, in Lisbonne 3 years ago. 
You can't walk into the old port without a guy asking if you want some cocaine ... This is not a joke or an exageration ... Like litteraly every 100m ! 
This is totaly out of hands
L'affaire c'est que souvent les addicts sont pas fonctionel et sont donc un boulet a la soci√©t√© alors qu'il pouraient contribuer si ils etaient pas toujours entrer de courir apres leur prochain buz. Sans compt√© qu'un village de crackhead au milieu des villes qui pissent partout et jettent leurs seringues souill√©s a terre cest pas super. Je comprends que la majorit√© des addicts sont fonctionels et ne derange pas personne mais il y a quand meme un portion significative dont l'addiction pourisse la vie des autres aussi.
Is le moneur de 16 ans veut se droguer, il est o√π le probl√®me. C'est quoi la diff√©rence entre une jeune qui se drogue √† 16 ans ou 18 ans?
Aussi pour ce qui en est de la prostitution, les temps ont beaucoup chang√© et ces femmes sont g√©n√©ralement compl√®tement consentente (or however you write that word). L'id√©e de la fille innocente et na√Øve qui se fait pi√©ger par un pimp m√©chant et manipulateur est principalement devenu un st√©r√©otype que tu vois dans le film.
L'approche est devenue assez simple et public sur Facebook. Je voyais des publications tel que "beaucoup d'argent rapide et facile, 18 and et plus, femme seulement", plusieurs fois par jour. Papa ne veut pas m'acheter ce sac a main Armani √† 600$ pour ma f√™te ? Pas grave, je vais all√© faire quelques danses et le tour est jou√©. Pas de nouvelles bottes Hunter pour No√´l ? Ainsi de suite. De nos jours, le pimp est la principalement pour blanchir l'argent uniquement.
Ce monde l√†, ce n'est pas Fugeuse.
Rip a fat one!

Depuis que tu lis mal les articles
D√©criminaliser les drogues ne veut pas dire les rendre L√âGALES.
&#x200B;
√áa veut dire que tu n'arr√™te pas quelqu'un parce qu'il a un probl√®me de consommation. Ils ont besoin d'aide m√©dicale. pas de prison.
Ce qui est fou c'est qu'on emprisonne beaucoup des gens qui ont besoin d'aide. 
Si vous utilisez les drogues fortes, vous avez besoin de th√©rapie, pas prison.
Cheque ce qui est arriv√© au Portugal. Ils ont d√©criminalis√© toutes formes de drogues en ~2000 et les taux d‚Äôaddiction ont baiss√©es pas mal. C‚Äôest pas un silver bullet mais on est vraiment en moment de crise pr√©sentement. Je suis originaire de Vancouver et la situation est encore pire la bas. Ce qu‚Äôon fait pr√©sentement marche pas...

Never ever use Americans as example.
Lol...les Zamerequins ...y cachent leur drogue entre les plis de leur huit mentons lol
`The beatings will continue until moral improves`
They actually are.
That's the only place they can be legalized.  It's federal jurisdiction.
FYI those guys aren‚Äôt selling real drugs.
They‚Äôre taking advantage of tourists who think it‚Äôs safe to buy drugs openly there because they don‚Äôt understand the meaning of decriminalized.
You‚Äôd get baking soda instead.
Same thing happened to me when I visited Lisbon two years ago, but if the benefit is not jailing people for being addicts‚Äîputting them on a path to a life of crime, then I think it's worth the annoyance of getting hassled.
Its very illegal in Portugal to sell coke which is why you got harassed by dealers.
Same thing in Amsterdam.  In the red zone at night, you'll get offered anything and everything.  I'd imagine 99% of it is fake, nobody is stupid enough to sell real hard drugs by approaching strangers on the street.
Look at HIV transmission rates post 1998 - they've fallen off a cliff.  C'est mieux si un touriste a ete demande tu veux cocaine que tu vas beacoup des gens a cote de surdose sur la rue (comme un nuit a place des arts :/). ces gens ont besoin d'aide.
>Is le moneur de 16 ans veut se droguer, il est o√π le probl√®me. C'est quoi la diff√©rence entre une jeune qui se drogue √† 16 ans ou 18 ans?
"alcool, drogues, cigarettes, loteries, conscription, droit de vote, droit de travailler, √¢ge de consentement, c'est quoi la diff√©rence entre 6 ans, 16 ans ou 18 ans ?" - toi
1) Sa prend 18 ans pour fumer, boire etc. Juste la logique...
2) Il y a malheureusement du human trafficking qui se fait surtout chez les adolescente defavoriser. Elles se font promettre la lune par des membres de gang de rue qui les envois dans d'autres provinces isoler. Faut pas prendre sa a la legere...

This is the crux of this article, which comment op doesn't get.
You can help someone with their addiction AND incarcerate them for breaking the law.  One doesn't preclude the other.  You can argue against incarceration and advocate for better treatment but assuming mutually exclusivity weakens your argument.
M√™me chose. √áa m'est arriv√© quelqu'une seul fois parcontre. Un simple "no" et ils ne t'harc√®lent pas plus que √ßa.
Selling should still be criminal. Consumption should be treated as a medical issue. Tackle both sides.
1. Justement c'est √ßa que je dis, il n'y a pas de diff√©rence que √ßa soit 16 ou 18. Ces produits demeurent nocifs peut importe l'√¢ge.
2. Je n'ai pas dis que √ßa existe pas, mais que ce genre de cas est beaucoup plus rare que ce que tu crois. Quand la personne que tu as contact√© pour du travail te dis argent rapide et facile, femme seulement et 18 and et +, le tout en une seul phrase, tu t'attends √† quoi? Ajoute √† √ßa OnlyFans et les sites tel que backpage. La prostitution n'est plus cette image que les films t'ont mis dans la t√™te quand tu √©tais jeune.
il y a aussi du monde qui font d'la drogue pour le fun, parce que c'est l'fun... pas tous les utilisateurs de drogue ont des probl√®mes de drogue 
meme si je vivrai dans une utopie je crois que j'aimerais quand m√™me faire un trip d'Acide, de md ou whatever de temps en temps...
"Pers√©cution" does not mean incarceration. Maybe you're thinking of "prosecution".
They're asking for decriminalization for personal use only IIRC. Selling does remain illegal I think.
1) 16 ans tu es ado. 18 tu es adulte. C'est ca la difference. Le mineur n'est pas en age de prendre ses decisions. L'adulte oui
2) T'inquiete je connais tres bien le milieux üòâ. Je sais que c'est pas coutume surtout au Quebec mais 1 c'est une de trop et on dois tout faire pour que sa n'arrive pas.
You are right.  I was confused.  Thanks for clearing it up.
Bruh, L'age ne veut rien dire. C'est la maturite qui compte. Que tu es 15 ans ou 35 ans, dans les 2 cas l'alcool (exemple) n'est pas bon.
On commencera pas a faire passer un teste pour donner un permis pour boire de l'alcohol. On met un age et voila. C'est comme sa. 18 ans. Cmon la. J'ai l'impression tu nous fait tourner en rond pour rien.
Non je dis juste que les choses nefastes pour la sante devraient tout simplement pas etre dans le marche. Que tu te saoul a 16, 18 ou 25 ans, dans n'importe quel cas, ce nest pas bon.

A true mensch ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏èüëè
amazing story! so thankful there are people like Rodney <3 I hope the guy he saved is also able to get the help he needs...
That's a REAL MAN with a HEART.
This story gave me goosebumps and a thought that how many people are struggling with their lives. How much depression is there to become rich but all they can afford is to pay bills.
Not sure what made that guy to jump but I salute this barber! Such a heroic act. Hope the other guy would be better:)
If we find where his barbershop is, I think he would appreciate letters and seasons wishes. I am happy to share a city with a person who makes space in his heart and daily life for empathy when society makes it that much more difficult for all of us.
I also hope as a city and as society we can make the right changes however small to give people breaks and not have them work 2 difficult and physical jobs in order to make ends meet and to have a decent life for themselves and for their family.
Incredibly brave man. Bravo!
I can relate to jumpers like that because at some point of my life if i saw a subway car coming and thought how easy it would be to just jump and let it end my life. Of course i didn't really want to kill myself, but on bad days one can get carried away and it do happen.
Not to mention the savage balls to be a man who admits he broke down in tears for the thought of his family. In this day and age where social media will judge you as a man as toxic if too strong, and worthless if ‚Äúweak.‚Äù
This is gold hahaha
And grand father at 47...
What really humbles society is that somebody can own a barbershop, but still has to operate a forklift overnight to make ends meet.

The fedora probably stayed in the car.
It was captivating how he described the ordeal.  Also kudos to the man that came and grabbed Rodney before he went over too.

"People will judge you no matter what you do, so you might as well do what you want"
It's not being "strong" that gets you labelled as toxic. It's being shitty.
Was a barber, can confirm. Especially since covid. We lost a lot of clients because many people don‚Äôt want to risk catching covid for a haircut, so they cut their hair themselves or go longer between haircuts. Can‚Äôt blame them.
Tip your barber!
Commenting to let you know you have a cool username
I love this quote thanks for sharing.
As the old adage states don't judge a person until you've walked a mile in their shoes. Yes indeed we do have that nasty tendency to pass judgement without knowing anything about the individual. Sad but so true......
I will both agree and disagree. The issue, just as women in leadership have previously been called ‚Äúbitchy‚Äù for being steadfast, is men being called toxic while truly not being shitty. I‚Äôve had to mentor men in leadership accused of being toxic for not bowing to pressure for special privileges by individuals. Privileges that would harm the majority of their owns colleagues. 
Personally, I have had the fact that I hunt for my own food called ‚Äútoxic masculinity.‚Äù Despite being pruned up like some little British peacock on a pheasant hunt (purposely making fun of myself as you could not find someone less ‚Äútoxic‚Äù looking even when I am hunting as a north american) with my favorite Harkila shirts, purple ties, and frankly overly pretty german and Italian guns with rose engraving. FYI, have also seen men owning guns labeled as toxic masculinity.
The term is applied with very broad strokes in social media. I did not in my comment refer to an appropriate usage of the term, or the definition of it, I referred to social media‚Äôs capacity to label men so easily as ‚Äúbeta incel‚Äù or ‚Äútoxic alpha‚Äù based on little more than one action, tweet, or accusation. Unfortunately, sometimes inappropriately and hatefully, and quoted as all in the name of being inclusive and against hate.
Without being shitty or spineless, the term is now applied to men‚Äôs actions freely by few. In leadership, this happens even when the great majority of your peers and colleagues of either gender are thanking you for either being diplomatic which is not weak, or having stood up for them which is not toxic. Men should no more suffer this inappropriately than female leaders who stand up for what is right should be called a bitch, or when diplomatic be called feminine and kind as if it is a trait limited to their sex and not their intellect.
The term has been widely misused and criticized for its harmful misuse. It is even misused in academic circles who study gender differences, authors involved in its earliest definition are also wide in its description. Below is a quote from the Atlantic, if you read it understanding that Terry Kupers actually partially described the problem as being competitive ‚ÄúTerry Kupers describes toxic masculinity as involving "the need to aggressively compete and dominate others", then you can understand how he has been criticized or misquoted, which he admits in the Atlantic interview could have been avoided. Unfortunately, this has led academic circles to use the term for normal traits that are simply more prominent in men, despite these very same traits being celebrated in women. Will we now call women‚Äôs ‚Äúagreeableness‚Äù traits weak femininity ? : 
‚ÄúAs this research was popularized, however, it was increasingly mischaracterized. By the mid-2000s, despite Connell‚Äôs objections, her complex theories were being portrayed in ways that echoed mythopoetic archetypes of healthy and destructive masculinity. In a 2005 study of men in prison, the psychiatrist Terry Kupers defined toxic masculinity as ‚Äúthe constellation of socially regressive male traits that serve to foster domination, the devaluation of women, homophobia, and wanton violence.‚Äù Referencing Connell‚Äôs work, Kupers argued that prison brings out the ‚Äútoxic‚Äù aspects of masculinity in prisoners, but that this toxicity is already present in the wider cultural context. (Kupers told me that he believes critics of his study incorrectly assumed that he claimed masculinity itself is toxic, though he acknowledged that the article could have explained his position in greater detail.)‚Äù
Even if he owns the place? I always wondered.. I want to to tip him but I don't wanna be condescending...
Thanks! Proud to be from this awesome city
Yes, tip your barber even if he owns the place. Tips are a super important part of barber and hairdresser incomes. 5$ is considered a good tip for a 30$ and under haircut.
My hairdresser charges 18$ so I give 20$ and tell him to keep change.
Yeah. I do my best to give a bit more now. I know my barber used to see over 12 on a Saturday before and now sees maybe 3. I could pay 4x but my barber wouldn‚Äôt take the money (I‚Äôve tried paying double before).
Generally people tip at least 15% (for you, that would be around 3$). 5$ is considered a good tip. I‚Äôm sure that your hairdresser would appreciate it!
Honestly walking in Montreal at night I'm more scared of cars than gang members. Drivers don't pay attention as much when there aren't many cars or people around.
I am sure that others have different experiences as to this, but I tend to agree. I live in Saint-Leonard and have for 17 years, in the southwestern quadrant that blurs between Saint-Michel and Montreal Nord, and very rarely have I looked over my shoulder with concern. Of course, we must be vigilant, but I generally feel safe. Comparatively speaking, Montreal must be one of the safest big cities to live in Canada, and the crime statistics (comparatively speaking) back this. 
I think a lot has to do with your personal mindset on the matter, experience, and to to some extent immutable characteristics (I'm an average-sized male). I work at a store in Place Dupuis at Berri-Uqam, right in front of the sketchy park. Yes, people are shooting up and doing deals right within earshot, at times barely 15 feet away from me, but I never felt in danger in anyway. I consider myself lucky in the sense that I have never been mugged, attacked or harassed in public, and for sure this affects how I perceive potential dangers and how I gauge my safety in some parts of town. I cannot blame someone for feeling unsafe, especially if they were once a victim of these kinds of actions in public. My brother, on the other hand, was the target of an attempted mugging in Parc Pie XII (somewhat forested and quite dark at night).
Two of my coworkers are French and lived in Paris for most of their lives. Depending on the arrondisement, Paris can be described as unsafe at night, especially for women. They perceive Montreal as quite safe, and they are generally astonished that a woman can walk the streets in Montreal without being a constant victim of stalking, harassing, wolf-whistling, although I won't deny that it still happens here. I think that people who have lived in Montreal most of their lives don't know how good we have it here.
There‚Äôs definitely a few places to avoid in this city, especially for women walking alone. Like, y‚Äôknow, Berri-UQAM area after dark (and even sometimes during the day). The pandemic has only made things worse there. But for the most part I agree.
Felt that way for most of my life, then I got mugged in the metro station took every day and it left me shook. 
Funny thing is, they were actually nice about it lol
I got fucking polite thieves lmao
Thinking back, I was mostly shook that in the place I felt the safest, something like that could happen. I was literally on cloud 9 that night. I had been volunteering all day, felt good about myself, had a few drinks afterwards and was happily buzzed and feeling ultra blessed and kinda horny. And then bang. It happened. Once the adrenaline wore off and I stopped chasing the thieves, realizing that even if I caught up with them, there's literally nothing i could do to them and it could even turn super dangerous for me. It doesn't help that I'm a petite woman who looks half my age hence why the fear reaction shot by a thousand once I got back to my senses. I was shaking and crying and the bus driver let me on without paying (last bus in service) so I could go home, since the thieves had my wallet and phone. Police said nothing could be done as there were no cameras. They just didn't seem to care at all. 
Now I just never go out when its dark unless accompanied by someone.
Amen, brother. I've lived here virtually my entire life and I can't remember the last time I felt my personal safety threatened.
I agree but part of that is because we don't tolerate violence. 
No, it's not acceptable that gangs are having shootouts in the middle of residential areas, even if you're unlikely to be shot. 
No, it's not helpful to say "At least we're not as bad as Chicago or even Toronto", our standard is much higher than theirs and it's only by stubbornly insisting on that standard can we hope to keep it that way.
Look I'm glad you feel that way but as a man you probably have a much, much easier time walking around than any woman. Your girlfriend agreeing with you is no proof that it's safe for us as well. I've felt very uneasy and uncomfortable several times walking around at night, even though I know I could probably defend myself a little bit.
The media blows everything out of proportion. Montreal is a huge city and there will always be shit head criminals causing a rukus
And it's not good to sugar coat the situation either. There's clearly something going on in this city since the pandemic started.
The rise of the crime rate in Montr√©al is very alarming. So while i admire your positivity i think it's important to face the facts.
The authorities need to increase their presence everywhere in the city. That'd be a good start.
As someone relocating to your city soon, this post helps put me at ease a bit!
Alright, any time of the night, i want you to check out de la Gaucheti√®re between the hospital and say, robert bourrassa
TVA just wants ad-revenues
Je suis d'accord avec toi par contre il faut quand m√™me s'assurer de ne pas perdre le contr√¥le. Pendant la guerre des motards, on se disait la m√™me chose:"bah ils se tuent entre eux" jusqu'√† ce qu'on se retrouve avec des victimes innocentes...
"Arme blanche" is knife about 99%+ of the time; in any case, I'd say that part of why Montreal is relatively safer is because people actually bother putting up a major fuss about it when incidents happen. Because of that politicians notice, and tell civil servants to try and do something about it. It's not always super efficient but it usually gets results methinks.
Montr√©al is beginning to feel like this old gentle friend you haven't seen in a while and you're not sure about anymore. 
Maybe violence is like housing and we are just beginning to catch up with the rest of the world? (The two aren't totally unrelated.)
I hope I am wrong.
I do feel safe walking at night but I will say that the rise in people in crisis on the street is also alarming. It's never fun to have people screaming at you for no reasons. And let's be honest, with all the trash around in the city, you never know when you could receive a traffic cone behind the head. Honestly, the subway feel sometimes less safe than the streets.
Its not random street attacks that are a problem though, its all the innoncent bystanders who get hit by stray bullets and the gangtards' total disregard for human life.
Totally disagree, lived in montreal for 11 years (2010 until 2021)   
2010-2016 werent that bad...but then homeless issue has gone out of   
hands. Several times I had to run for my life while existing metro   
stations (mcgill, berri, place des arts, concordia and atwater  all   
located in the downtown core area) cz some homeless person(or bunch of   
them) got super pissed drunk and decided to throw empty beer bottles and  
 piss in public and spat on people. countless times near concordia or   
atwater, homeless women offered to blow me for $5. Mind you this all   
happened in a broad day light week days and if someone call police, they  
 ask you whats the ethnicity of the person, you say native, either they   
hang up on you or just no show.
Walking at 4 am in Laval not a noise except for the lil birdies going chirp cheep churp.. and the occasional skunk.. the air is so clean.. mosquitoes are gone.  Best time
General tip: don't use social media as a window into a city. Don't get your info on here or bogus news outlets.
I don't feel safe around some area in Montreal.  There's somewhere on the Southwest on some street called Avon. It looks like it's full of drug dealers. I also wouldn't walk along Hochelga at night close to the port alone.
Interesting, as a woman, I am often quite afraid
I never feel worried or scared, even late at night, and I'm a woman and on the petite side. But I'm always "aware" of my surroundings. I've gone home late at night all alone and while there are creeps, nothing has ever happened to me.
I‚Äôm from San Francisco‚Ä¶ 
I‚Äôve been here 5 weeks. Your city feels UNBELIEVABLY safe.
I have to agree. We are visiting Montreal for a few days from Edmonton and haven't felt unsafe once. I live downtown Edmonton and I don't feel safe even walking downtown in broad daylight.
I never felt unsafe walking in Winnipeg either. Criminals seem to concern themselves with other criminals. Now rural Saskatchewan? Yeah that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll see some sketchy behaviour.
>you get hit on by some random dude/lady, but feeling unsafe? Never. I'm male
How could you write this and not think it was a bad idea lol
I agree that theft isn't common but I've seen someone get their headphones stolen off his head and make chase (very sad, the man was an immigrant and thought that kind of stuff didn't happen here). 
I was also molested in the metro when I was 12. I've been hard followed about 3 times and chased/grabbed at by strangers and it was terrifying each time, 2 of those times was in broad daylight, and the third time at like 9pm.
I mean, I never feel safe anywhere. So ¬Ø\ _(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Im way more afraid of Skunks wobbling around at night
Everytime i go out for a smoke at night i have to look both ways
I have lived in Montreal for 15 years. In that time I have been: 
- sexually assaulted by a massage therapist
- attacked by someone having a mental health crisis at 8am in the middle of busy Plateau intersection.
- narrowly dodged a falling window pane from a second story on St Laurent blvd. 
- hit by an out of control car the parking lot of my daughter‚Äôs daycare (kid was still inside the daycare thankfully). 
Even with loads of therapy at the expense of the province and my own, I am still just a little weary of this city - day or night.
Omg I moved here from London , England and I don't feel the need to put my keys in between my fingers constantly. It's fantastic. I apparently live in a 'ghetto' area according so some people I know and it's just, not lol.
I have biked from downtown up to cote des neiges at 2am and never felt in danger of anything
Yeah...walking in Montreal North at 2am north of maurice duplessis would still not be advisable.
Yeah. Montreal *feels* safe, but all this violence is new around here, and in fact it makes the city less safe then it was before.
Op be like: Hey..im a man...women feel safe in Montreal!! My gf agrees!!!
Lol...that is so chauvinistic...
Comparing to what I had back home with a barely avoidable petty robbery and just hate attacks of bored young males ("gopniks", hooligans), Montreal has no crime at all. Hobos are annoying and say things, but unlike it is with hooligans, I never experienced any attack after ignoring the hobos. Almost all violence happen within certain circles here. Was someone unrelated even attacked here lately?
This is overwhelmingly why I have left. And why I will stay despite all the troubles the deteriorating housing situation is causing for me in Montreal nowadays, or despite the worse ratio taxes/services.
I always felt safe as a tourist (4 times) even after reading about the organized crime in Laval.  Maybe because I stayed in touristy areas or because I was in a happy vacation mood.
As someone who has lived in montreal nord for 12 years now, I can tell you that if you mind your own buisness and not act like an idiot you wont get attacked.  That being said, I attended highschool in montreal nord and it had a lot of shady people and gangsters. Plus my cousin used to walk at 3 am in the morning from his job and he would constantly hear gun fire.
As for me, the only crime I have ever seen was a guy who shot someone in the leg near my house or a store near my house which was burnt by some lunatics. There was also many times where I walked in shady streets at nights and saw gangs of 20 peoples, obviously because I dont want to get robbed and I cant fight 20 people, I got the hell out by walking in another road.
The only place I will tell you to avoid is STmichel, do not go there, it's infested with gangs and I heard many of my friends who have been there and almost got killed by gangs when minding their own buisness.
I lived all my life in latin america and you are correct
Montreal is exceptionally safe considering its size, for a western city. Making a fuss about tiny things is just what Montreal people do, lol
completely agree! i was more scared living in the GTA, but here i feel a lot more safe
Try having a gun fight in front of your house where you can hear the gunshot.
Mind your own business and nobody gonna fuck with you.
Safest city ever. Makes it more boring than some other spots on planet earth, but i i do love the safety. Sensationalist local press is just that. I recently posted a question on why the press makes montreal north to be some disaster but looks fine to me, mostly. Agree 100%
Meanwhile I have the opposite feeling. Every single night I hear gun shots outside, and now the police is often on my street because of this. I often hear people screaming after those gun shots, and they are so close that I KNOW that one day, those bullets will hit me. You often hear how in Rosemont, bullets hit houses and even hit people inside. My window is right on the street, if they shoot in my window, I'm fucked.
I'm glad for you that you still feel safe going outside, but I don't even feel safe inside in my room anymore.
And I am always surprised at the number of people driving under the influence of alcohol at night.
Any subject montrealers don't link cars to it ?
No idea why you're being downvoted, you make pretty good sense to me.
>I think that people who have lived in Montreal most of their lives don't know how good we have it here.
I lived 15 years in smaller city in the US and Montreal definitely is way safer.
So you work at bureau en gros? I live near that area.
Yeah I feel like some people only look at where they live (family-friendly areas) and generalize.
There's been a change, that much is clear. Berri-UQAM during the day is sketch.
If you live close to night entertainment spots, it's honestly 4x worst than before.
I'm just a pleb from the south shore. Taken from Recreoparc. I love city skylines, I'll def need to go back out this summer for more pics of Montreal!
Superbe photo! J‚Äôaime tous les gens sur ce groupe vous √™tes tous de belles personnes, aussi magnifiques que ce panorama!
C'est un pano de Verdun!
Je pensais √ßa serait facile de prendre des photos larges dem√™me, mais finalemebt, je me suis rendu compte que c'est difficule; j'suis tomb√© dans le pano.
Very nice, I don't live far from ste-cath, I should visit that park
I can see my old room in this pic. Cool.
Wow! So cool!
Good job! C‚Äôest vraiment une belle shot!
This is really beautiful, thanks for my new UW wallpaper.

La meilleure vue de MTL...loin! /s
Hey hey, √ßa c'est mon pays ! Je te conseille plut√¥t de descendre les escaliers en face de l'√©cluse, la vue n'est pas obstru√©e par l'ile aux Hurons, c'est selon moi, la meilleure vue de Montr√©al.
En prime, tu seras au pied de l'eau (marche pas sur la glace, mais trempe toi les pieds l'√©t√©, l'eau est chaude) contrairement au reste du R√©cr√©oParc, o√π la berge est abrupte.
If you're looking for suggestions, there's the obvious place to shoot downtown Montr√©al from the river, which is from Parc Jean-Drapeau on √éle Sainte-H√©l√®ne, but a weirder location is from Pointe du Moulin on √éle Perrot since you can see downtown from the tip near the windmill across Lac St. Louis on a clear day. The park is currently closed (according to Google Maps at least) but I presume it'll be open by the summer.
You're right, it's an old photo. I shot it 2 days ago
La meilleure effectivement.. lol... √áa reste laitte su un osti d'temps pareil
Cool, merci pour l'info! Je vais garder en note pour la prochaine fois. La vue a l'air excellente un peu plus vers l'est d'o√π j'√©tais en effet.
Parc Marie Victorin √† Longueuil a aussi une tr√®s belle vue.
J'ai grandi sur l'√Æle. J'ai habit√© sur le boulevard Perrot, proche de point du moulin durant 3 ans. 
Tr√®s belle vue si un peu loin.
Of course, you need a decent telephoto lens to be able to make out the individual skyscrapers from Pointe du Moulin but since they're all on the slope of Mount Royal they are still quite visible from that distance, with Lachine and then a lot of water in the foreground.
the old champlain bridge is still up?
On doit bien reconna√Ætre qu‚Äôelle a des petits d√©fauts mais si ils vous d√©rangent tant, respectez au moins l‚Äôeffort.
Oui t'as raison, avec le pont Jacques-Cartier en avant plan, c'est magnifique.
La ville le probleme, pas le photographe.
Une belle panoramique du Fiorre serais tr√®s sexy faite par ce m√™me artiste.
Il y a certaines images de la ville sur le subreddit qui sont juste insane. Je mettrais plus la faute sur les conditions m√©t√©o et le format de l‚Äôimage inadapt√© si on doit bl√¢mer quelque chose.
Used to volunteer at the hospital as a John Abbott student. I‚Äôm so happy that the Veterans are finally getting the recognition that they deserve from the provincial government.
Thankfully, the title is slightly inaccurate: **He lived long enough to receive news of the settlement, which was the important thing to him. And he was overjoyed at it.**
It's just that the legal system moves at the pace of a glacier - there'll be a hearing where the court will decide whether to approve the settlement in April, and who knows how long after that the payments will actually be disbursed.
J'√©tais convaincu qu'ils avaient d√©m√©nag√© les v√©t√©rans quand Qu√©bec avait pris possession de l'√©difice.

Volunteered there in the early 00's for bingo night; Back then the huge hall was just a smoking session for everyone there. I couldn't see the ceiling 50ft up because of the plume of smoke.
Can I still be adopted by the veteran?
It's a settlement, that's all. 
Nothing will improve at the facility.
I also used to volunteer on Wednesday nights for about two years... it's a shame that they weren't being recognized by the province. The gentleman I was usually with was always full of stories and him and his wife were genuinely interested in what was going on in my life too.
same here!!!
Saint-george represent lol
Correct, but at least the Veterans have received some sort of compensation
Wow hey humans. I'm from l'ile Perrot
I know this is r/Montr√©al but this feels surreal.
No one ever talks anything of the west end of Montreal.
I didn't even know there were problems with the hospital.
My point exactly. It sucks for them and it's awful that they were mistreated when they served our country in times of need. But perhaps now the remaining veterans have some closure.
I want to support local businesses whenever possible. I appreciate you sharing this list. However, when I checked out a few of the websites I was completely turned off. Ethical, sustainable and local = 300$ for a simple t-shirt? WTF. I‚Äôm sure there are people willing to spend that much, but I would much rather put those funds towards an early retirement!
J'ai vu une section pour les souliers sur Rags alors je mentionne Anfibio qui fait des bottes d'excellente qualit√© ici m√™me √† Montr√©al ! [https://www.bottesanfibio.com/](https://www.bottesanfibio.com/)

I can't open a brand's page on a different browser tab because the list items are not links.

Okay...either you‚Äôre all very well off, or I‚Äôm just cheap. We are dual income, no kids, upper middle class and I cannot justify paying the price for most locally made apparel.

You are missing many Montreal based clothing brands.
Off the top of my head I can think of 2 Montreal ones. One being [Nathon Kong](https://www.nathonkong.com/) and [Poche et Fils](https://pochesetfils.com/) the other.
Marigold https://marigoldmtl.com/ et  Yoga Jeans https://yogajeans.ca/ (quoi que c'est √©crit Saint-C√¥me sur leur site) J'ai deux paires de jeans achet√©s en 2012 qui sont encore dans mes favoris!
Yaaaass this is awesome.  You could post on r/femalefashionadvice and r/malefashionadvice too.

Est-ce que √ßa vaut la peine d'y aller? J'allais acheter des billets mais genre $90 √† 3 personnes pour aller voir des lumi√®res de No√´l, pas convaincu...
this company has a ton of labour rights issues...
Where is that?
It looks beautiful from the 15. I'd jump on this but it's over 100$ for the family. And for what? 45 minutes? I'm not impressed with some of the things I hear about the company either.
Still, it's cheaper than the Ferris Wheel in the old port. I wont pay for that either.
Nice composition !
Je croyais que √ßa se visitait uniquement en auto?
En auto probablement pas, l'attente est d'une heure environ avant d'entrer sur le site, pour les visiteurs en voiture. √Ä pied les enfants ont aimer, marche d'environ 1h30. √áa d√©pend de ton budget sortie, est ce la meilleure chose que tu peux faire avec 90$ non,mais c'est bien amusant.
We're in Verdun and I'm glad we went. I know it's expensive, but I figured, we haven't spent much lately on family outings and activities. It took 30min to get there and we were driving through for over an hour.
Non, √ßa vaut pas le prix. On est all√©s (en voiture pcq covid et  c'est le free for all √† pied) et j'aurais pay√© max 30$ pour √ßa. C'est placard√© de publicit√©s de commanditaires. Le circuit en voiture prend environ 50 minutes. 
Je l'ai fait parce que mon fils trippe sur les lumi√®res, mais on ne le refera certainement pas.
√áa vaut peut-√™tre pas la peine en janvier, mais nous on y est all√© le 23 d√©cembre, et si t'aimes le moindrement No√´l et le temps des f√™tes, √ßa vaut la peine!
Consid√©rant que le nombre d'activit√© en temps de covid est tr√®s tr√®s petit, ca fait toujours quelque chose de diff√©rents √† faire. On a √©t√© super content d'y aller ma copine et moi.
C est tres partag√©, j y suis all√© l ann√©e derni√®re, j'ai vraiment pas aim√© du tout.
Mais pas mal de gens ont l air d avoir vraiment aim√©.

Boulevard de Souvenir, Laval
Il est possible de faire le trajet √† pied maintenant moyennant de se tenir a distance.
On est all√© en voiture √† 17h un dimanche. 10 minutes entrer sur le site et 50 minutes faire le tour du site.
Pour 90$ √ßa vaut pas vraiment la peine, mais en temps de pand√©mie y'a pas grand chose √† faire, donc √ßa remet les choses en perspective.

Ah bien tant mieux je connais quelqu'un qui a attendu 1h.
I went last year (second time) and was highly disappointed.  Don't think I can recommend it again.
Is it still $30 a beer?

Oh! There weren‚Äôt any vegetables last year. Don‚Äôt know if a huge eggplant is worth the ticket price though..
Where was this picture taken?
Do you mind sharing the ticket prices? me and my mother have been curious about going but have no idea of the entree fees!
Illumi was so disappointing. Maybe better in winter with snow everywhere??...
I can‚Äôt believe people spend actual money on watching LED lights. Passing by on the 15 southbound, it looks like the lamest thing on Earth. 
I feel like even cultureless suburbanites would enjoy the chain restaurants at nearby Centropolis more.
Niceee üôà
Right? A good amount of pieces were off. Snacks and alcohol prices are crazy. And really, some of them are super lame. The space part with the planets was soooooo meh. So much opportunity for creativity missed.
It's alright if you have young kids still amazed by that sort of thing, but yeah it's not really worth the price.
Yup and you get to watch ads for Ford and Rogers‚Ä¶still beautiful though

I went before the pandemic. I felt caught in a roadside traffic trap at the side of a windy highway with electrical cords and slippery rubber decking everywhere. The circuit was anything but cohesive with random themes everywhere....at one point there was a zone with nothing but red spiders. Very random. The buffet at the time was real meh. I definitely prefer Foresta Lumina and Jardins de Lumi√®re any day.
It's the Cavalia dude who produced it. Everything he touches turns to somehow profitable horseshit.
I went with my kids‚Ä¶but yah they could have leveled up‚Ä¶nothing like the forest lumina in tremblant.
Could not agree more, this guy is a scumbag
this probably helps with the profit
> Minister Proulx announced a $2 million subsidy for the Illumi project as part of the Quebec government's efforts to develop event tourism and promote Quebec products in order to stand out from the international competition. The project has also received $200,000 in support provided in equal shares by the Ministry of Tourism and Tourisme Laval. These investments will stimulate the regional economy, attract more visitors and augment Laval's tourism revenues.

This was made by Moment Factory. Much better outfit.
Foresta lumina, c'est a Coaticook. Tremblant a juste copi√© l'id√©e.
Lumina was not the best but it was much better than Illumi for sure!
Oh, that looked nice!
According to the event's website that existed in 2017 and was not continued or at least is not open in 2021?
Tremblant √† commander son propre show par la m√™me firme, tout comme 10 ou 11 autres places sur la terre.
N'emp√™che que c'est a Coaticook que le bal a √©t√© lanc√©. √áa a √©t√© un boost incroyable pour le tourisme dans cette r√©gion, mais c'√©tait un pari risqu√©. C'√©tait sur qu'il finirait par y avoir des imitations. Le seul autre que j'ai vu √©tait au zoo de saint F√©licien et ce n'√©tait pas √† la hauteur de Coaticook.
Salut! Je travaille chez Moment Factory, la firme qui fait les Lumina. 
Les marches Lumina sont vendues aux clients qui souhaitent en avoir, y a pas d‚Äôimitation ici puisque c‚Äôest nous qui faisons la conception de chacun.
D‚Äôautres marche nocturne ont vu le jour depuis mais si y a le nom Lumina c‚Äôest fait par Moment Factory.
Coaticook √©tait le premier non? Est ce que c'√©tait comme un projet pilote? D√©sol√©, c'est un peu de chauvinisme pour un coin de pays que j'aime beaucoup.
Oui c‚Äôest le premier. √Ä la base le projet c‚Äô√©tait de seulement illuminer le pont du parc de la gorge mais en voyant le site est venu l‚Äôid√©e de faire un parcours √† zones multiples.
Le succ√®s de Coaticook √† engendr√© tout les autres par la suite.
Est-ce que √ßa vaut le co√ªt d'aller a celui de Tremblant si on est d√©j√† all√© chez Coaticook?

From an old map of Montreal, this building was listed as a "Usine d'agr√©gats" for a quarry called "Carri√®re Francon": [https://i.imgur.com/7t57txD.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/7t57txD.jpg)
Matches with Google Satellite view: [https://i.imgur.com/l2tYAK0.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/l2tYAK0.jpg) 
Did a search on BANQ website and found a couple of ads for this company from the 1960s:
[https://i.imgur.com/L0Mid6P.png](https://i.imgur.com/L0Mid6P.png) From "La Presse, 10 octobre 1961, Derni√®re √©dition"

The area in question is now owned by the City as a snow dumping ground.
Picture 5 und 6 shows a converer belt. Maybe they processed salt there. No idea. Or coffee? The nearby street is called Albert-Louis Van Houtte Avenue. And this man founded a coffee company called "Van Houtte". [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-Louis\_Van\_Houtte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-Louis_Van_Houtte) ... Maybe they packed coffee there for shipping. Keurig has an office also nearby. But everything else is just guessing.
This seems to be the area, where the city of Montreal unloads all the snow in the winter season, if you switch from streets to satelite view in google map, you might see the ramps and a lake, which is not to be seen in the street mode. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQujcjTZEG8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQujcjTZEG8) (0:39)... I drove down the Route 125 / Pie XI so often to Laval and never expected that there, west of the Autoroute 40... However, that does not help here.. The building seems to be overgrown in a forest.
I‚Äôd guess it‚Äôs related to an old cement or concrete plant, considering it‚Äôs in the territory of an old quarry.
it's hard to tell what building you were in exactly but  it looks like you were in what's currently known as carriere St Michel. it was once the site of a quarry and  cement plant, so it is very possible you're seeing something related.
Cool find OP. 
I'm glad these pictures were taken while it was sunny. J'aurais peur en titi si s'tai la nuit ><
I'd be careful wandering into abandoned places.  We have thousands of homeless ppl in this city and you might stumble across an occupied abode.
Ooooh i need to go O_O
Was it at the bottom of the quarry? I remember going down there as a kid 12 years ago (pie-ix side, through barbed wire) and there was an operational pumping station.
well, THIS place is about to get overrun and then made completely inaccessible...

Pleas OP use a respirator if you visit such places. Asbestos is not uncommon and other materials turn unto fine particles with time. You don't want health problems due to exploration.
Residential school?

I wanna be like you when I grow up!
My grandfather used to work as a cement finisher for this company. Can confirm he has told me about this quarry many times in stories. I don't live too far from it either.
Solved!
This is quality investigation!
Goddamn, you are good
Sometimes, getting carried away with our daily lives, I forget how rich the history of MTL is.  And it's surprising places like that still exist to this day.
Never knew they had such an impressive dumping site in mtl!
> And this man founded a coffee company called "Van Houtte".
surprised it would not be restored or used as some type of hipster "coffee shop" that sells home made popsicles and chips while promoting weed smoking
Ya honestly I was a little scared, of people at first but then it was of animals because there were tons of animal tracks inside but no signs of human life.
Ya it was, looks like 12 years ago might be the last time someone went down there.
Yeah the google map drop pin is a bit too much information IMO...

Before Canada has its own currency,  BMO notes were the currency
When I first moved to Montreal in 1994 I walked in there and tried to open an account, I thought it would be cool to bank there. They just said no.
That building is incredible.
The columns inside are so beautiful. The whole architecture too
Anyone knows what that building to the right is in the oldest pic ?

I have a Bank of Montreal half penny token from 1844. The government at the time wasn‚Äôt making enough coins so they authorized the banks to make their own which were used as legal currency.
The yellowish one? I think it's the building that has Suite 701 and Kyo Sushi on its ground floor. Not sure if offices or residential above it. The non-yellow one is part of the same BMO building.
It‚Äôs the Hotel Place d‚ÄôArmes

What happens to the yachts during winter time? Is it feasible to own a yacht in Quebec City or Montreal?
Thank you! :))
merci!:)
Anything is possible with a pant-load of money.
yes certainly ! they will just be taken out of the water during winter time! (they‚Äôll have to be stored indoors)
Most smaller motor boats can be put on a trailer. Sail boats usually get put on giant stands at thier yacht club because they have a keel. This is done using a small crane. Sailboats can also be put on elevated trailers. Some sailboats like mine have a retractable keel so it goes on a low trailer. Bigger motor boats im not sure, since there arent any at my yacht club, but theyre probably taken out of the water somehow
S√©rieux, on prend les petites bonnes nouvelles quand √ßa passe.  
" Hair salons and other personal grooming centres will reopen " 
2 jours apr√®s que je me suis clipp√© la t√™te...
Either lockdown until it's good to go back to normal or don't fucking lockdown at all. Locking down for a few weeks and then going back to life before lockdown is so fucking pointless. We've been through this already. Cases will just start going up again then we'll lockdown again in the summer.
Fuckin joke. Stupid fucking government.
Si les magasin non essentiels ouvrent, donc il n‚Äôy aura plus de sections bloqu√©s dans les magasins, right? La seule raison les grands magasins ne pouvaient plus vendre les items non-essentiels √©tait √† cause de la fermeture des autres magasins donc?
Where are they getting these stats for the curfew opinions? Everyone I know does not feel the same and attributes the decline in cases to stricter measures in schools as well as the continued closure of non-essential businesses. Hmm...
YO jvais enfin pouvoir  aller acheter des patins !!! J'osait tellement pas comander √ßa en ligne sans les essayer ! J'ai si hate de faire du patin !

Am I the only one hoping for museums to reopen with crowd limiting procedures? Near empty museums are a blessing
It's about time.
Legault is a moron. Why open stores now but keep the curfew going. Keep the curfew and keep non essential stores closed until there is a significant decrease.
Wait so is curfew gonna be extended past feb 8?
Can I meet my friends in a park?  I get that the economy is important, but I just want to see some people outside and not have to worry about some over zealous SPVM officer making a deal of it.
Close the borders.
Hardcore lockdown for a full month and a half.
Reopen everything with no cases at all.
They're so fucking stupid. Finally something is working and they stop doing it...
Gyms need to be open too
Can we close the fucking borders permanently ? Please.
I can't wait to buy my non essential goods!

I don't think they'll be able to impose the same type of lockdown or curfew in the summer. People will lose it, I'm already seeing it
[deleted]
We'll have to lockdown the same percentage of the time either way, so what difference does it make?
Oui c'e√ªt √©t√© de la comp√©tition d√©loyale.
Was thinking the same thing, 76% support? I don't think I've spoken to a single person in the last few weeks that was in favour of the curfew. These are some Putin statistics
>356 Quebec respondents
>Quebec/Population 8.485 million (2019)
lol
The stats and polls... everytime I hear "70% of canadians think that...." where are these polls? Who are answering these damn things? I've never seen or heard anyone take one lol
I agree with the curfew-- it seems to be bringing the numbers down. I'm sorry that its inconvenient for everyone, but it does seem to be working. I really wouldn't say that "strict measures in schools" are working though-- kids are pretty much the same as they have been.
[Aaaaah j'ai SI HATE!](https://i.gifer.com/UFR0.mp4)
Et les aff√ªt√©s!
That should be the very last place to reopen before stadiums/music halls.
Ahh, the notion of essential vs unessential in a country where winter weather can drop to -30 and less. Of course basic winter equipment should be considered essential, right ? 
Enjoy your warm hands friend !
pharmacy was selling sun screen but the gloves were non essential
Me too!  I lost one of my good ones about 2 weeks ago.  I've been making do with doubling up crappy mitts and stretch gloves, but it's not enough when it's below -10.
I am so glad I didn't need to buy any. I work outdoors, and in previous years, I would wear them out so quickly that I would just stockpile a whole bunch of really cheap ones from Dollarama to last through the winter. Well, since work is slower these days, I'm still fine with the tail end of last year's stockpile.
you could start a fashion trend, don't sell yourself short!
Username checks out.
Jcomprends pas pourquoi tu dis √ßa avec un ton sarcastique. Si tu pouvais continuer √† achet√© des items non essentiels chez Jean Coutu √ßa aurait √©t√© un gros fuck you aux commerces qui ne vendent pas 1000 produites diff√©rents, et les pharmacies seraient pleins. Je suis compl√®tement d'accord avec la fa√ßon qu'ils ont g√©r√© cette portion du lockdown.
Yup, we already had significant measures in place but were forced to close 4 months ago anyway. I had given up hope of reopening! I can‚Äôt wait to just go get lost in an old painting at MMFA for hours...
Museums are reopening too!!
The curfew helps regulating social distancing at home. I think it's the main factor in virus transmission. Infected people in close quarters.
The curfew sucks but I believe it helps. The non essentiel rule also helped but it had to be loosened in order to keep the morale of the population up.
Man, c‚Äôest triste. J‚Äôesp√®re qu‚Äôil trouve de l‚Äôaide.
Hi all! I work in a community centre in Pointe-Saint-Charles and work with seniors. I saw this poster last month and called.
Without going into details, I was able to help the person. There have been a lot of people needing help and expressing their need over the last 18 months, but I had not seen such a (dystopian?) cry for help. 
I'm also running as independent candidate for borough councillor in the Sud-Ouest. Thank you for posting this.
 By the way, we are always looking for volunteers to help seniors in the Sud-Ouest, mostly breaking social isolation and food security. You can contact me if you want to help.
dans une grande ville comme Montr√©al, je suis pas mal certain que quelqu'un a appel√©. Il manque d'ailleurs 3-4 num√©ros dans le bas.
J'esp√®re que it's not a trap! lol
I was reading my grandfather's Italian newspaper (Il Cittadino Canadese) and in the petites annonces was one sole entry of a 68 year old woman seeking someone to spend her 'twilight years' with and it broke my heart. This poor old lady using a dying medium, of a dying community (there are less and less native Italian speakers every census) trying to find company.  Ugh.
Is he insinuating money or someone to help him with his day to day activities? I would help him with free lifts sometimes
r/aboringdystopia
I hope they get the help they need. That's the problem with social services in Montreal, they're a pain to access and the people who should help you... don't.
I had an issue once and went to the CLSC and the social worker there literally said to me: "Well what do you want *me* to do about it?" I responded with "Help me. This is the *centre local de services communautaires* isn't it?... Direct me to a department or organization that can assist me." They had no clue what to do. If it wasn't someone who was having a health crisis, mental or otherwise they were clueless. I eventually sorted it out by myself and found the help I needed. You're on your own for a lot of stuff you shouldn't be.
Will anyone call and come tell us how it goes?
Qqn a appel√©?
Tabarnak...
Makes me smile to only see a few tabs left :\*\*\*)
I know that good people can help. I just hope no con artist takes advantage of him.
I hope he got his help. I work with seniors and I know some are in isolation during this dire time..

So without going into details.. was he just looking for companionship? Housekeeping? A personal support worker? All three in a french maid outfit?

It tough to find someone at 36, imagine at 70. 
My grand mom learned computers in her 70s, and now in her 90s, e-mailing her friends and facebooking her french family was a soul saver in the pand√©mie isolation.
Dang now that‚Äôs old school
That's very nice of you. I would help him by making custom mojitos with him on Sunday afternoons and then shooting the shit together.
Another unforeseen backlash from 40 years of neoliberal atomization of the individual. Expect these to explode in popularity in the next few years as more and more retirees become isolated and as fewer and fewer able bodies are available to soyrt them.
Calling 311 could be a good place to start when you're not sure where to find the help you need. It's a pretty good service but of course everything depends on who you land on when you call. Either way, it's a good place to call
what? of course not
Somebody had the decency to staple one of the tabs right on the ad. That makes me smile a bit.
Feels weird to call this an ad.
personally I have very little faith in humanity and assume that most of those will be used to fuck with the guy one way or an other.
Loneliness has nothing to do with age.
I'll make tacos : or perhaps you're a burrito fan ? we'll see sunday, no pressure.
Meh, most babydoomers are relatively wealthy and demgraphically, they own the government for a few years.
IMO the gvt will throw the money necessary to keep those voters happy, and other gens will pay the bill.
The 311 number is specifically for municipal services not social services. If you want to know when the large item garbage pickup is in your neighbourhood then you call them. If you want social services such as information on how to apply for disability benefits or get food assistance, they won‚Äôt be able to help you.
Well thanks lol, now I think that too.
You're right. That's federal. Sorry about that, my bad.
Cool find ! Je suis n√©e sur la rue Marquette , d‚Äôailleur mon p√®re habite encore cette maison que mon grand-p√®re √† achet√© dans les ann√©es 50
Wow‚Ä¶ rue Marquette‚Ä¶ nord de ‚Äúla 40‚Äù? Ou peut-√™tre il y avait une autre rue Marquette dans les ann√©es 30?
Hasn‚Äôt changed a bit!

Effectivement la rue Marquette s'arr√™te √† la 40, mais bizarrement il y a un petit tron√ßon qui r√©appara√Æt tout au nord de la ville. Il y a des chances que ce soit l√† car √©videmment le nord √©tait moins d√©velopp√© dans le temps que plus vers le centre.
J'habite √† quatre rues √† l'ouest de marquette (chambord), entre beaubien et saint-zotique, et les plex de ma rue ont √©t√© construits en 1923-1924.

C'est quand m√™me surprenant comment j'ai rarement vue des autos-√©cole dans un accident.
Kinda hilarious tbh. But I bet whoever put the car there didn't feel great about themselves for a day or two after that.
And to think I was nervous about my parallel parking skills the other day because sometimes I don't get it on my first attempt... At least I can say that I've never done anything like that... Yet...
Lets say a student was driving, im guessing the student won‚Äôt have to pay anything right?
for a minute i thought i was in the New Orleans subreddit page..yikes
seems like there should of been a proper metal plate over that huge pot hole vs just some plywood
Lool we have the best roads what are you talking about ü§£
There is a Napa store near where I live and I saw a black one of these driving down the bike path. Must be a Hyundai thing.
What an old shitbox to learn how to drive in lol. Doesn‚Äôt seem like a safe car
You can already see it has been replaced once, with a smaller sticker. That says it all :)
649? Ha... approved Accredited saaq..  more like 1000
I'm confused. Both of your statements are in the title.
There is always an instructor in the car with their own brakes, but no steering wheel. That being said, if you really want to fuck shit up, I believe it's possible even when the instructor is inside. This particular driver has decided to do exactly that it seems.
Jokes aside, it seems like there are some people who counterintuitively push the gas and close their eyes when they panic. Our driving school did this two students in the car thing, when you drive and another student sits in the back, and then they drive and you sit in the back (instructor in passenger seat at all times).
I was literally shitting my pants the entire test wondering what is their insurance policy in case the other student actually kills me during this test. She would do crazy shit like accelerate when she sees traffic cones in the lane ahead, turn right directly into the opposite traffic lane, etc. Crazy stuff...
This shits old, I doubt anyone‚Äôs walking around in winter coats today.
It‚Äôs plywood. I don‚Äôt think the construction workers planned on cars driving on the sidewalk lol
I would imagine the student only pays if it's shown that they did it on purpose
Normally no, it's insured. 
The instructor on the other hand is in trouble I reckon. Normally they have enough control of the car to avert this kind of situation (they have their own brakes)
It's kind of unfortunate, because this will be traumatizing for the student for quite a while. We don't know what happened obviously, but in most cases stuff like this should be under the control of the instructor.
a car's a car...
Do you need a rolls royce for learning to drive mr millionaire?
If anything a cheap pos is the best car to learn in.
Yeah $650 is pretty sketchy lmao. Both my car and motorcycle courses were $1000 each
Same situation as you, one day I had to enter the car with another student, one student drives car while other student sits in the back. It was at montreal nord, she was driving eratically, the driver instructor had to slam the brakes multiple times because she did not stop before a red light. In another, while going down an incline, while turning to the right, she slammed in the side walk and you felt the car bump a lot.
bro im getting scared from reding ur comment im doing that exact lesson in 2 weeks
Donc une candidate parfaite pour Canada's worst driver?
Busted - it was end of March
That or they grabbed the wood to try and make a ramp out
It‚Äôs an unsafe POS to learn to drive in sorry not sorry
Still a funny pic either way !
And you deemed it unsafe how exactly?
Because it‚Äôs safety ratings actually aren‚Äôt very good
Ah yes, the ol' Montreal construction festival
Good people but atrocious roads and parking. Yup, that's Montreal.
This story is funny coming from a Mississaugan because who would ever drive to downtown Toronto and expect to find cheap and plentiful parking? No one drives downtown for the day unless they plan to use a full day parking lot. And obviously parking is different in Mississauga, it's the equivalent of Laval.
You're better off going around the center by bike or public transport.
Effectivement le stationnement est souvent assez difficile dans les quartiers centraux. G√©n√©ralement c'est plus simple de payer pour le stationnement de l'h√¥tel ou des parking garage 24h quand il y en a un pas trop loin.
Sinon le stationnement au bain colonial est tr√®s accueillant!
Montreal will be a beautiful city once they stop building the roads...
The kindness of the strangers is one of the most touching things about our society. You will also see young people regularly stop to carry baby prams, groceries, or heavy buggies up our metro stairs. If you see someone strange just try a good ole tip of the hat, or wave like queen Elizabeth. Usually a good laugh will startle a druggie. Most are completely harmless. I have found strangers generally speak up for each other as well if there are difficult interactions in the Street. I'm glad you were able to see the beauty of this city.
Another question tho:
We are both Chinese and we were pretty tall, I'm 193cm and my fiancee 179cm. My fiancee is really good looking but we were still wearing masks no matter where we went out of habit. 
This has never happened to us anywhere else and we were super confused and tbh a bit scared: 
1. Waking around the street at like 4 pm and this old smoker lady (who looks kinda like she's under the influence of something) starts telling me my fiancee is hot and then starts catcalling...
2. Saw this tall girl who passed us by on the crosswalk and just stared at us. THEN she literally stopped in the middle of the crosswalk and stared at us for three minutes. Like she STOPPED in the middle of the street crosswalk and stared at us until we were at the next block. 
Dunno if this girl was under the influence or something but this was at like half past nine at night. 
Holy shit were these experiences unsettling.
Believe it or not, Montreal is possibly one of the easiest city to park a car in the downtown area of any major cities in the world.
I work on the road and park my car at about 5 different adresses per day, haven‚Äôt had a ticket in about 6 years.
Please dont take this the wrong way... Driving downtown is a nightmare, but there is more than enough parking in Montreal. The parking meter doesnt work, just walk to the next one. Use a private parking lot. Its the same issue in Toronto, Quebec City or New York. Or use the public transit.
Hell yeah! Gotta take care of one another. Nobody else will. It's the only way this great project of civilization we're on will work.
Bro, you don‚Äôt need a car in Montr√©al. Save the headache and leave it at the Airbnb next time. Montreal has legit some of the best public transport in the world.
Caution, I was once fined some 68 $ after parking on the wrong side of the street on cleaning day. On some streets in MTL, a couple of hours are reserved for road side cleaning for one day. This was completely new to me. One day, I forgot about it and did not move my car and was reminded that way...
Montreal is a magnificent place, I once stranded with broken cooling system near the pont Cartier and some friendly Montrealers helped me out with coolant fluid. Offered him money, non non, he loved to help people.
Next time you‚Äôre in Montreal, use the P service mobile app. Just enter the parking meter‚Äôs number, and pay via a credit card. Easy.
Thank you for your patience: even locals don't have it and avoid this mess. 
Hope you had a great time ! 
Next time, use a bike. Don't ask, our politicians don't care about you and expect you to travel around on a Bixi, since it is supposed to be easier and it is also a green alternative transportation method. 
You don't like cars, don't you ?
Many commerce will not take AMEX in Canada, just a heads up. Also most parking metters that dont have a main terminal that link them all together will only take coins or payment via their apps.
Sounds about right, I once spent 40 minutes trying to find a parking spot around my college that does not have restrictions, ended up comming 30 mins late to my class.
Everyone comes together against the shitshow that is getting around the city.
Yeah bad roads, bad parking, and in some cases even worse drivers. Hope you had a good time here!
Cant go to montreal anymore
There are a lot of dumb little rules, like parking restrictions, that are unique to Montreal, and that you are expected to just know. I've lived in Qu√©bec for 7 years and I avoid the island of Montreal at all costs ü§£
If you're so grateful maybe mention the name of the app in your description? It's called " P$ Mobile Service montreal "
Google maps didn't know about that at all hahaha
351 days of the year, 24/7. Best festival in the world!
Whos headlining this year?
Good people, atrocious roads, Montreal! (---> let's do tshirts).
I agree about Google maps being useless because they never know about the detours, and the construction situation here is worse than Toronto for sure.
Yeah and walking was also amazing, the views holy shit were they good.
No kidding, I was walking on Ste-Cath yesterday evening and crossed St-Denis, and saw that the street was under reconstruction. In the last few years we've had work done on the place in front old Institut des Arts Appliqu√©s, brick work on the UQAM building, the UQAM church refraction, the reconstruction of the sidewalk, and now the street. I wonder if that section of the street will ever be work free.
thank you 40 years infrastructure debt
A story as old as time itself!
Will they ever?
There are some really weird people downtown. For Montreal standards, what happened to you is pretty mundane.
Regarding parking, it is indeed very confusing. Usually main streets have paid parking spots, but you need the app to use a credit card, or cash at the machines. Alternatively, there are private parkings, but they tend to be quite expensive. Residential streets are usually restricted to locals, with a sticker system. And then there are tons of exceptions, like cleaning hours, delivery spots, school spots, it may change in the middle of a street for not-so-obvious reasons, keeping track of everything is a mess.
We like cool specimens, dude.
We have a lot of crackhead and drunks downtown. I get called pretty boy walking to the metro sometimes... when she's not passed out face first on the pavement.
Do you not go outside much? Lol. Montreal downtown street culture is really not any different than Toronto. 
I just spent the weekend in Toronto (I'm from there) and there are weirdos there too. Smaller Asian community in Montreal but so much so that you would notice a difference in a short trip... More something that you'd be affected by if you moved into a suburb here.
I've been called hot mama, twice, different people, while pushing a stroller with kids downtown. The catcalling is next level.
Maybe the tall girl was prospecting for a model agency? One of my collegue who is super tall and pretty was recruted by an agency while walking downtown. We figured out their office was a couple blocks away from ours on St-Antoine. She soon after that traveled Europe for a while witht them (pre covid).
Edit: I just re read your story. Stopping in the middle of the street at night  makes it more likely she was a crackehead.
I can't explain any of it but I doubt it was a race thing because we have plenty of Chinese international students at our universities. Probably just intoxicated?
Downtown, in certain parts, is really tricky lately. Bc of covid, homelessness, addiction/drugs. And bc less people -- workers, tourists, shoppers. So, more questionable types. Even areas that used to be pretty normal, and definitely in the daytime (Parc/Bleury, Concordia) are much sketchier now. 
But you need to think of it like Yonge Street. Exactly the same deal of weirdos/sketchiness being around certain key parts, but sometimes mixing in.
truth. Takes some getting used to reading the parking signs, but its pretty clear/easy.
Caveat - it's the easiest city to park in once you get used to the signs and understand how to do it. I've had many friends visit from Ontario and somehow mess up parking and get a ticket. I found it confusing when I first moved here. But after a year, I had figured it out and now I do find it much simpler than Toronto

We drove around because we wanted to drive to Quebec City as well but honestly next time I shoulda just took the train or flew over and then biked everywhere.
funny enough, my Amex became a lifesaver at the parking meters. and yeah, other places dont really take Amex lmao.
Sorry I didn't know what app she was using T.T

Tu shoote un olympus, right?
I can‚Äôt see the tail to really confirm, but are you sure its not just a groundhog? Look like a groundhog to me.
c't'un siffleux, gros big
it's a very happy looking marmot yes
That‚Äôs a groundhog. There‚Äôs a couple living in the mountain.
Tell me you've never seen a beaver, without telling you've never seen a beaver üòÇ
As others mentioned, it's a groundhog.  A beaver has a very large flat tail and it's fur is darker and looks slicked back, almost greasy looking. 
Groundhogs are normal residents of Montreal (and they'll do a number on your veggie garden!)
Cette marmotte m'a l'air parfaitement √† ses aises.
100% un sifleux
Thank you for confirming, I'm glad that is not a beaver, and he is all good in the bushes.
That's no beaver. Looks more like one of the animals we see in the parks, by the casino, the F1 track etc. 
Marmot maybe? But no beaver.
Lol
haha its a groundhog, not a beaver. And yes its normal.
Beaver: "They're trying to make me go to rehab and i say no, no, no"
This is not what the Alert flair is for OP.
C‚Äôest une marmotte tabarnak
I worked a season at Laronde a few years back. Laronde is like a retirement home for groundhogs. They are all 20 pounds + because they essentially eat Beaver Tails all day.
I operated the Choo Choo train ride in the kid's park and would often have to call in the engineers to clean up crushed groundhogs who were too obese to get out of the way.
Beavers are hella big, relative to this guy.  When it reopens, you should do a trip of the biodome, they have some there you can see.
C'est une marmotte √ßa 
Pis oui c'est normal
Big c‚Äôest une marmotte‚Ä¶
C'est une marmotte haha, une famille enti√®re vit sous la remise dans la cour de mon bloc!
groundhogs are everywhere
This is absolutely a groundhog. 
Beavers are bigger, have a different face and obviously the tail.
Est-ce que c'est juste mon impression ou bien il y a vraiment plus de marmottes que l'habitude dans les parcs de Montr√©al?
L'autre jour j'en voyais 10 en m√™me temps et √ßa se chamaillait pas mal
Those are groundhogs/gophers and they are quite happy where they are, but can be quite the garden nuisance.
One of the test to diagnose a mental illness is to show two pictures: elephant and hippopotamus. Subject with certain mental illness couldn‚Äôt distinguish them. 
In Quebec we have the same test but the pictures are hedgehog and beaver.

There‚Äôs lots of efforts by the Universit√© to promote wildlife and [biodiversity](https://durable.umontreal.ca/biodiversite/plan-biodiversite/#c7478). Some cottontail rabbits have been seen recently!
I think he escaped from Beaver Hall street.
[Leave that groundhog alone, it's clearly on its way to rehearsing with the band!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3r5CwpJlZA)
I also saw one at Mount Royal Park a few days ago
The street there, that's √âdouard-Montpetit, right?   
There's a resident marmotte at this metro (UdeM), you can see it relatively frequently.
That's a marmot, friend
Groundhog are everywhere near the Mont Royal, they even became a problem in C√¥te-des-neiges cemeterie because they dig up bones.
Have you never seen a groundhog before?
Nor a beaver?
Saw one in my back yard in little Italy Tuesday. Groundhog that is.
Lol thats a groundhog and they‚Äôre everywhere
Lol not a beaver. It's a MARMOTTE! I call it this in both languages because it's more fun than groundhog :P
wait until you hear about the coyotes of Villeray
That's a groundhog, beavers have large flat tails. It's normal seeing groundhogs in Montr√©al. They are everywhere in the city.
The fact that I knew this was a groundhog and then confirmed in the comments makes me feel so validated as a Canadian.
That's not a beaver. It's a groundhog. It's fine. Leave it alone.
That's a groundhog. Behind the neuroscience department we have (had?) A small clearing, there were a lot of them.
that's just a groundhog doin' its thing
Lol yeah i walk around the mountain a lot and see soooo many groundhogs. They‚Äôre just chillin.
That‚Äôs a groundhog. üòÇ
Il faut vraiment √™tre d√©connect√©
That in a ground hog.  But rest assured.  The universities in Montreal are FULL of beaver.
Groundhog
I saw a couple of those hanging around Montreal, Im pretty sure its a muskrat or a marmot...?

Je pense que ce sont les autobus qui ont caus√© le plus de probl√®me, et ce qui a du retarder l'√©volution technologique. Dans le m√©tro c'est assez simple, tout est connect√©. Mais c'est une autre histoire dans les bus. Y'a pas si longtemps tout ce qu'il y avait c'est une boite pour d√©poser de l'argent. L'autobus devait √™tre capable de valider la carte, titre ou correspondance, enlever un titre de la carte, le tout sans connection internet √† aucun serveur. Maintenant ils sont connect√©s, et un nouveau systeme se mettra en place bientot. 
Par contre je n'ai jamais compris pourquoi la carte expire au bout de quelques ann√©es...
En 2015 c'√©tait le #InnoverCommeLaSTM
https://www.google.com/search?q=innover+comme+la+stm&oq=innover+comme+la+stm&aqs=chrome..69i57.7400j1j4&client=ms-android-google&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8
I have had "Opus √† l'ann√©e" for a few years, and it's really convenient.  It automatically renews the monthly pass by drawing the fee from either your credit card or your bank account.  They also send you everything through mail, so you can exclusively deal with them online :
https://www.stm.info/en/info/fares/subscriptions/opus-lannee
I work at the STM and eventually they will accept electronic payment, they are at the testing stages, that‚Äôs also the reason for the new readers in the buses. But the testing isn‚Äôt finished yet.
You have to pay a card reader in order to recharge your opus card online 
https://www.stm.info/en/info/fares/opus-cards-and-other-fare-media/opus-en-ligne-card-reader
They‚Äôre getting better with small upgrade at a time. Like now you don‚Äôt have to always have money on you if you take bus and you forget your opus card you can (generally) pay with nfc which is really nice. From what I‚Äôve heard in the past they want to introduce an opus app in like 2024-2025, but no integration with Apple Wallet (which is stupid cause they‚Äôre argument is it doesn‚Äôt work for everyone one, but android as the same so just make it compatible with the two or more service it ain‚Äôt that complicated). It‚Äôs not the priority for the stm now to upgrade, people are ok with how it works now (even if it‚Äôs stupid and inconsistant). Also they should also upgrade their "tourniquet" which is totally surpass now as more and more metro and public transport just count on people to do it and use the money saved to bring more control in the metro it self. Like how the ARTM was doing on the deux montagnes train. Oh and last improvement if they do the last one, monthly pass shouldn‚Äôt have to be activated at each passage, but only the first time. It‚Äôs done worldwide and work perflectly fine.
Moi ce que je comprends toujours pas apr√®s toutes ces ann√©es c'est pourquoi je peux charger certains titres sur la carte et d'autres non.
Si je prend le train vers St-Jerome et que je mets ma carte OPUS dans la machine d'exo je peux pas y mettre un titre unitaire et mes options sont r√©duites. Si j'enl√®ve ma carte OPUS de la machine et que je dis que j'en ai pas, j'ai soudainement beaucoup plus de choix pour les titres.
Bref, souvent ma carte OPUS est inutile car je dois quand m√™me finir par acheter un titre qui n'est pas disponible si j'essaie de l'utiliser.
√áa fonctionne bien pour 10 tickets √† la STM, par exemple, mais c'est absolument merdique pour tout ce qui est ticket unitaire avec exo. J'essaie m√™me pas avec les autres soci√©t√©s... je dis que j'ai pas de carte si on me le demande, c'est plus simple et j'ai plus d'options pour les titres.
OPUS cards use a French/Belgian system called Calypso
> Why can't I recharge it online, why do I have to go to a recharge station or buy the machine.
Because the central system does not have all the latest tickets. Buses probably have to upload all the taps at the end of the day, so the system's copy of your card does not get updated until then.
Except Navigo (Paris; allows mobile recharging), I have not seen a Calypso card capable of real-time recharging without a card reader; they either require you to wait a day or "collect" your ticket using a special reader on-site (which defeats the purpose).
> Why can't I put it in Apple pay and have it on my phone, I have all my wallet in my phone except this fucking card.
Express Transit (ie. adding OPUS card to Apple Pay) support is still very limited
Non-Express Transit (ie. paying by credit cards in Apple Pay) will probably happen soon tho, see other comment.
> Why do I have to renew it EVERY FUCKING YEAR.
Student: probably just to make sure you don't abuse the discount...
Others: Pretty sure it's every 4 years
> Why is this system so fucked up, cmon STM please do something about this
it's not that bad tbh
just wait until ARTM removes TRAM zones 1-8 and makes them ABCD, should fix the ticket mess
Ils travaillent sur une meilleure technologie. √Ä suivre.
Vla pas si longtemps, avec les cartes mensuels, je les achetais au commis de la station m√©tro pr√®t de chez moi.
Souvent la fin du mois il y a une petite file de gens qui se formait, ben une fois le commis a tellement stress√© a voir une file d'une douzaine de personne qu'ils est all√© se plant√© dans les toilettes, dix minutes plus tard toujours pas sortit, j'ai dut all√© a une autre station pour acheter ma passe mensuel.
En gros c'est pas parfait, mais ca s'am√©liore tranquillement.
I've did some preliminary research on the tech used by stm. 
IMO, NFC can and should be a thing. I know its possible but if the STM won't do it the best I could do is reverse engineer the chip, which would take me weeks or months alone and thats not even including all the headaches along the ways which these days I don't have much time for.
Its really sad that they still rely on old tech
I quite liked Contactless Payment when I was in London. STM looks way behind in comparison.
The ARTM is now testing a feature in the Chrono app (if you subscribe to the betas) that allows you to read the contents of your OPUS card directly from the app. I'm sure they would eventually extend this to buying tickets from the app and putting those on your OPUS card.
from what I heard, Apple is testing and adding bus and metro card to Apple Pay one city at a time in China since a few years ago and it's been successful in a handful of cities already. Learn, STM
> Why can't I recharge it online
Because buses are not online. You could equip buses with the necessary equipment (plus backups) but that takes time and money.
You can‚Äôt recharge it online because you need a card reader. The tickets are stored on the physical card itself, not a centralized system. Being able to recharge it online means connecting all the terminals, including the ones on the buses to the internet and setting up a server to manage that. Not a small task considering STM is publicly funded.
The pharmacy across the street from my apartment does it. You should see if there's something like that in your neighbourhood.
I just moved to Montreal a year ago and I have never lived in a city before, so, coming from a sprawling metropolis with no metro and using my car every day, I wish there was another option for paying the metro like the EZ-pass for tolls in the U.S. - you sign up, get a pass, give them your credit card, and pick a threshold amount, like $10, and then a recharge amount, like $25, etc. Whenever your card gets to that minimum balance you set, it automatically deducts the recharge amount without any interference from you. I wish for this because literally none of the current payment options are convenient for me - during work from home, I have no idea when I will use the metro next, it's always kind of spontaneous, so a weekly or monthly pass is just a hefty investment I most likely won't use, but it is such a pain that I have to go buy a pass every single time I want to take a trip, not to mention wasteful for the environment, have to touch the kiosk during covid, etc. I feel like moving to this "recharge" system (that another user pointed out is in use for the l'annee pass, so it's possible!) for spontaneous/less frequent travelers would benefit a lot of people, but what do I know.

This is also what happens with a publicly funded transit system‚Ä¶. 
NYC transit (MTA) for example is funded at Federal, State and City levels. 
Same boat as you though, it‚Äôs been at least 5 and half years we‚Äôve been hearing that they‚Äôve been testing nfc for stm. https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.3382059 this is from 2015 SMH
J‚Äôai entendu dire que √ßa va changer bient√¥t comme syst√®me. L‚Äôinfo vient de quelqu‚Äôun √† l‚Äôinterne qui m‚Äôa dit √ßa il y a 1-2 ans.
They had online tickets built in to the transit app since covid started and they took it out about a month ago, so dumb. Paying with your phone was amazing and easy.
My guess is their choice not to have buses all be online a decade ago is still hurting.
Edmonton doesn't take electronic payments. The pass that is used is similar to what MTL had before opus..
And there's 0 security checks for the trains there. You can go up to a machine that accepts change only, and get a ticket, or just get on and nobody cares. No barriers, no employees, nothing lol
You can buy a card scanner to recharge at home but renewing it every year is a pain.
STM cards were dead since to me since it stopped being pliable plastic cards with a different design each month

This is such a perfect example of the phrase "first world problem". Lololol
That's ONE\* of the reasons STM made me decide to buy a car.
I'll never go back.
&#x200B;
\*One of the other reasons : ''The service is interruptued one the pink line for an undetermined period. Thanks for you cooperation and think about getting a car.''
London buses have had this capability for years. I would guess most other large cities too. It‚Äôs a bit embarrassing.
> Par contre je n'ai jamais compris pourquoi la carte expire au bout de quelques ann√©es...
Il doit y avoir une raison car c'est le cas pour pas mal toutes les cartes. Ma carte OPUS expire, mes cartes de cr√©dit, ma carte de d√©bit, ma carte d'employ√©, etc. Ya juste mes cartes de points qui expirent pas.
Selon ma m√©moire pour avoir parler avec des consultants qui avait travailler sur les cartes opus a stm, c'est pour simplifier lla gestion de leur base de donnee.
Ils n'ont pas besoin de conserver une carte infiniment, par contre je ne comprend pas pourquoi il ne font pas juste tuer les entr√©es qui ont admettons eux aucune activit√©s durant les 48 derniers mois..
> Par contre je n'ai jamais compris pourquoi la carte expire au bout de quelques ann√©es...
La plupart des cartes √† puces ont des compteurs de transactions qui ne peuvent pas revenir en arri√®re, pour √©viter que des gens mal intentionn√©s essayent de les "rejouer" pour dupliquer des paiement, consommation de tickets, etc.
C'est calibr√© sur l'usure moyenne de la carte en plastique elle-m√™me qui s'use avec les insertions et le frottement dans les poches. Avec les cartes sans contact √ßa r√©siste plus longtemps, mais les compteurs dans le code de la carte √† puce elle-m√™me n'ont pas forc√©ment chang√©s.
J'ai deja eu ca. Mais depuis COVID j'ai pas besoin d'un passe mensuel, juste d'acheter des weekend ou daily pass, pis criss que c'est de la marde de devoir faire la fil pis pas pouvoir juste fil up la carte online si t'a pas la machine.
√áa ne marche pas pour tous les types d‚Äôabonnement. Totalement illogique.
That is not what OP is asking at all
Thank you ! Thats good news !
I read plans about Apple Pay support, but what about having an OPUS card on Apple Wallet and being able to tap it, similar to what they have in Chicago or soon NYC? Is something like that being tested?
I know, what I meant is why is there not just a website where I can recharge it online, why tf does the verification system for a pass is offline, cant they make it so I don't need the machine and that nothing is stored on that card.
They had same system in Paris (navigo pass) and recently they change the system with a NFC card you can charge with phone.
It is cool but the card reader became useless. So I would not go for the card reader knowing it might change in coming years.
Good lord, did you click on the link? It‚Äôs out of stock. Because. Of course it is.
This thing is a total piece of junk and is way more trouble than it's worth.
Mine worked like once or twice before my computer stopped recognizing it as a device.
Paying with NFC at the bus? How does it work? Do I have to hold my phone in front of the terminal where we usually tap the Opus card?
>From what I‚Äôve heard in the past they want to introduce an opus app in like 2024-2025, but no integration with Apple Wallet (which is stupid cause they‚Äôre argument is it doesn‚Äôt work for everyone one, but android as the same so just make it compatible with the two or more service it ain‚Äôt that complicated)
Actually isnt it the same kinda fight that Epic is having with apple over Apple taking 30% of IAPs which I figure buying tickets/monthly passes count towards?
Il y a un piton sur la machine pour voir plus d'options. Ca m'est arriv√© quand j'ai voulu juste acheter 2 billets au lieu de la passe mensuelle.... c'est peut etre ca le probleme?
>Except Navigo (Paris; allows mobile recharging), I have not seen a Calypso card capable of real-time recharging without a card reader
Je comprends pas le point. Ce qu'on veut c'est de pouvoir taper notre cell direct sur la machine en rentrant dans le bus. Pas recharger notre carte avec notre cell...
The every year thing - there are two expiration dates on the card - one for the tickets and one for the card itself. When they send you an subscription card, they give it a year expiration. You can see this when you have the card reader.
Also I read part of the spec when I my fare got denied a wonderful feb29th. 
My subscription was valid, but the card itself expire after 365 days ( expiration is not a date but #of days)
~~Funny, the QR codes for covid are also a joint France QC thing as well.~~
~~Also equally clunky~~

I just want a bagel from Muffin Plus. With a coffee from Cafe Depot. Maybe a sandwish for lunch from the portugese restaurant in the food court.
Wow I'm surprised. I remember this from like 15 years ago lol.
i want a croissant from that french place next to the sushi shop in the corridor leading to the metro
Je confirme, mes enfants en ont fait un tour l'an dernier. Ils ont ador√©.
Oh for real? Haha wow, it is a classic then. Always full also.

They tried nothing and it didn't work.
Let‚Äôs keep the malls open tho üëåüèΩso people can buy gifts for gatherings they can‚Äôt even go to lmfao. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt link cases to stores‚Äù Although its literally the last thing open. Long life consumerism and trying to ‚Äúsave the economy‚Äù , look how well that‚Äôs worked out for the US.
How is it logical to cancel Christmas but not close down malls, schools and workplaces if controlling the curve is not going the way they planned.
If lives really were more important then the economy they would sacrifice everyone, not just people living alone who are going to get the worst Christmas of their lives and might not even live to the next one.
But yeah, gotta work, consume, sleep, repeat.
At this point no one will ever trust the words he says. I can't remember how many times he's pulled a bait and switch. Not an easy job he has for sure. 
As far as I'm concerned, if the past two months hasn't helped slow us down then nothing will. This covid thing will not be under control until we get vaccine roll outs. People just are too tired of it all, don't care enough to protect themselves and others and really, this thing is just so contagious.
Je vais vous avouer que moi et ma famille nous ne prenons pas la nouvelle tr√®s bien. M√™me si nous comprenons. 
Je n'ai absolument plus un seul milligramme de piti√© et de patience pour les imb√©ciles profonds qui ne veulent pas porter de masque et n'y croient pas au COVID 19.
J'ai √©norm√©ment de mis√®re avec ce gouvernement et leur fa√ßon d'op√©rer. Je comprends les gens qui renversent leur all√©giance, qui doutent ou qui ne coop√®rent plus.
√Ä une plus petite √©chelle, quelqu'un qui te fais √ßa tu arr√™tes d'y faire confiance, voir tu les coupes carr√©ment de ton cercle.
On sait que la g√©rance en temps de crise c'est difficile, mais √ßa en devient de la torture psychologique maintenant. Donner espoir pour ensuite retirer et tuer ce m√™me espoir. Je suis d√©moralis√©e, c'est vraiment d√©calissant.
Can't say we didn't earn this outcome.
The real mistake was the initial dangle.
Let's not forget about the most important part of the holidays: capitalism.
Just celebrate Christmas at Carrefour Laval
Good, that was a half baked idea to begin with.  Relying on people to voluntarily self isolate for 7 days right before Christmas was never a realistic expectation.
So, I guess we are just gonna deal with 1000-1500 cases a day until the spring then? cause they havent implemented any new restrictions in schools or businsses which are the main sources of outbreaks right now. Hell, they had all summer to try and work with nurses and doctors to better their conditions and pay them better for the second wave, but instead they just did nothing. I am NOT paying for the government's mistakes with my sanity, sorry.
Why say it and then go back on it? Because poor mental health and increased suicide rates are cool cool :/
And then they wonder why everyone is starting to believe conspiracies...
What happened to December 11?? That was two days ago. We all knew the situation wouldn't change, but why announce "a decision on December 11" only to announce two days later, "nvm we took our decision". I just don't get it.

Remember when Legault and Arruda were seen as heroes in the spring? What happened?
Is there any new information about efforts to reduce travel between areas, such as the highway checkpoints they had before?
√Ä place d'avoir 2-3 "d√©fi 28 jours" on aurait du avoir un vrai reconfinement comme au printemps. Mais on a un gouvernement qui ne veut pas aider les entreprises en temps dur (la preuvre regarder ce qui arrive √† l'industries de la restauration et des bars pratiquement compl√®tement laisser √† l'abandon).
On aurait pu sauver noel il y a deux mois mais l'ent√™tement du gouvernement √† vouloir "sauver l'√©conomie" va nous cout√© encore beaucoup plus cher et au final on aura rien sauv√©. Ni l'√©conomie, ni la sant√© mental de la population, ni le syst√®me de sant√©...

Literally I've been busting my ass off this year trying to be safe as freaking possible. Why do montrealers fuck everything up? I have been nothing but going to work and just staying home. 
Now your telling me my significant other cannot come over? For fucks sake!
Legault is so unprofessional,  he promised us something now we can't have it. 
I'm seriously fed up with him, I just want this to freaking pass as I wanna see the end as much as other people. 
My  mental health has been an all time low and that its just crushing that I cannot see my family at Christmas let alone I live with my parents BUT STILL I want to see my grandparents  and talk to them  its SO DAMN ANNOYING. 
I really hate this. ALO,  thanks for ruining Christmas.
on va le faire quand m√™me mais on promet de mettre nos masques !! et de pas postillonner trop fort ! ahahah
C'est triste de voir autre une majorit√© de gens dans ce "sub" √† la fois "intelligent" mais √† la fois naifs a un tel point que si le gouvernement Legault et son acolyte Arruda vous dit qu'il est maintenant obligatoire d'injecter du "Purell" dans le corps pour ralentir la transmission, sous peine d'amende, vous allez tous le faire sans hesitations...parce que c'est les R-E-G-L-E-M-E-N-T-S du...gouvernement.
Et le reste qui refuse de le faire, on est accuse de recalcitrant, non?
Oui, ce meme gouvernement qui interdit les rassemblements de Noel mais qui laisse les ecoles avec plus de 100 eleves ouvert. Wow!! Et vous avez encore cette confiance envers ce que le gouvernement vous dit?
Meh, plans are made. My wife and I are essentially 0 risk while the people we will be spending the 24th are pretty low! Good luck even attempting to police this anyways (they will be celebrating with their families/friends anyways). Anyone who feels comfortable seeing other for Christmas continue planning on doing so ... it's not as if your neighbors will stop themselves.
Yeah that's going to stop us.
I'll enjoy my dual citizenship and spend Christmas across the border with my American family. No harm done. Thanks for the suggestion Legault!

C'est le mode de fonctionnement de la CAQ. "Act now, think about it later". Comme √ßa ils ont l'air d'√™tre proactif, et quand √ßa foire (m√™me si c'√©tait 100% pr√©visible), ils peuvent juste venir s'excuser et passer √† autre chose. Le meilleur exemple de √ßa c'est la r√©forme de l'immigration de Jolin-Barrette.
La logique est pas mal la m√™me ici : la population voulait avoir une id√©e de ce qui allait se passer √† No√´l, Legault est sorti trop t√¥t pour dire : oui oui on va pouvoir se rassembler (en sachant tr√®s bien que la situation allait pas s'am√©liorer suffisamment en un mois). Et apr√®s quand le tr√®s pr√©visible constat que le nombre d'hospitalisation est trop √©lev√© arrive, il fait une conf√©rence de presse, l'air piteux pour s'excuser d'avoir √©t√© trop vite en affaire.
The CAQ government has always be extremely demagogic, so they don't have a far-reaching vision, they just go wherever the wind blows. Which puts them in a very akward position in the pandemic, because there is an actual crisis to manage and a large portion of their base is scientifically illiterate, conspirationist and/or opposed to government spending, so keeping them happy while managing an actual crisis is not easy and keeping their base happy is all CAQ knows how to do. 
So, to avoid spending as much as they could and give a sense of "lib√¢rt√©" to their base, they fully opened schools and workplaces with barely any restrictions (apart from indoor dining and museums and what not), but forbade pretty much every that fell outside of money-making activities. So, they look like they're handling the crisis, cause we can't hang out with friends even in safer settings, but we can go to work pretty much unencumbered. So, it's a bit like carbon offset. They have accepted that the many many cases that will come from unregulated workplaces are unavoidable and offset them with the statistically insignificant number of cases that would have emerged from going to the botanical garden or to the cinema. 
Their base doesn't like governmental handouts, so they're happy they get to work, and they're probably largely family oriented, so they don't really care about seeing people outside of their family unit. 
The problem is, since they are generally more tradition-oriented, they fucking love Christmas. So, the CAQ, in classical demagogic mode, promised them Christmas. But without changing anything from workplaces, where most outbreaks occur, they knew damn well it was not going to happen. That's where the genius of their "all-friends, only work" plan comes in, because was always the plan to put the onus of prevention back on the individuals. So, they promised us Christmas, pull the rug from under us, and who's fault is it? Not the CAQ for failing to regulate workplaces and staunchly refusing to recognize the role of aerosol in contamination. The fault can now be put on some faceless imaginary millenials or whatever that didn't follow the rules and that the CAQ base can fume about without questioning the poor state of the school's air vents.

Pampas grass is nice, phragmites is a pest you can see all along the highways :(
@ u/Rubrum_: I used to [see these](https://flic.kr/p/WsnYKo) ([and in winter](https://flic.kr/p/X4XftX)) on the grounds of the Douglas Hospital (where I worked) all year round. I always liked seeing them.  All these years I've been telling everyone it was pampas grass.  Have I been wrong all these years?
Yeah I'm pretty sure that's phragmites sorry. I think pampas is denser and paler.
This is so sad. I bike on that road multiple times per week, sometimes at night (with lights), and I‚Äôve always felt it was pretty safe with the wide shoulder. 
But at the same time, people are regularly speeding by. The same thing happens on the long stretches of road in √éle-Bizard. It‚Äôs not uncommon to see cars racing side-by-side in these areas, especially with the bored kids driving daddy‚Äôs car during the pandemic. 
Then there‚Äôs the whole other issue of texting while driving. 
I‚Äôm not saying that was the case here, but it‚Äôs a real shame that someone is dead. Cycling in the West Island is already sketchy as hell, but to die on a relatively ‚Äúquiet‚Äù road in the middle of the day with a well-used bike path is pretty terrifying.
I bike on that road (Chemin de l'Anse √† l'Orme) several times per week and it's hard to imagine how this could have happened.  The road is flat and made of several straight as an arrow stretches with fairly mild curves and great visibility.
On the other hand people do drive VERY fast on that road (100km/h+) quite regularly, and being so smooth and straight it's easy to get a false sense of security and get distracted.  I am hoping this was not the case.

They need to add concrete barriers here
Didn't a guy get hit near that exact spot only a couple days ago?
I bike regularly there and it can get scary at times, lower cars try to avoid pit holes and come more on the side 
It‚Äôs sad üòû
I've biked there once and did not feel safe at all. Wife and I were just talking yesterday about avoiding that road for our bike rides.
Road has 0 stops, long strip, and has a very nice wide curve to incentivise speeding.
I just saw a woman get ran over by a garbage truck yesterday, the same road a cyclist was killed on a couple of months ago. I am kinda terrified to walk around or bike right now.
She was the mother of one of my friends... She has 3 sons. Obviously it is unbelievably tragic. I seriously hope that the driver wasn‚Äôt intoxicated or on their phone or something; the family is in shambles right now.
It has to be distracted driving or some sort of mechanical issue...this road is as simple as it comes with basically zero distractions.
I absolutely can't believe this happens, all the time. HOW HARD is it to SLOW DOWN and give a big space when you see cyclists in the open road and there is space to make a safety zone?????????????
La mal√©diction des autos sans ~~chauffards~~ chauffeurs.
> Police investigating to determine why driver failed to navigate curve on l'Anse-√†-l'Orme Road
Because people can't drive for shit.
I just moved here from west coast. Being a driver myself, I find Montreal drivers impatient, pushy, and sometimes dangerous. That being said, most cyclists are entitled and oblivious of rules.
"Driver of car kills 50 year old woman". Newspapers need to stop letting drivers off the hook.
I bike and I drive a lot in Montreal..I do take a lot more risks while biking than driving and I see a lot of cyclist doing so.
Didn‚Äôt they hit face to face in the dark? The bike fronting on the wrong side of the road
As a driver, you have to be extra cautious. But I also know that most people on bikes don‚Äôt follow rules on the road and riding like they have 9 lives.
I don't understand why this sub cares so much about cyclists dying. People die in accidents every day; from falling, to cars, bikes etc. Does there really need to be a fucking torrid conversation about this that becomes factionalized because ya'll have nothing better to do than argue about bikes vs cars? It is a tragedy, but who the fuck cares.
Another fine exemple that bikes should gtfo of the road and go on bike lanes.
Her child is a secondary 5 student at my school. I can‚Äôt imagine how sad it is to lose their mother at 17.
Bike lanes are nice and all but solid lines don't protect bike riders from dangerous drivers. Metal bars or concrete barriers are needed for that but it's expensive and the cities are not willing.
What makes you feel like cycling is sketchy in the West Island? You mean due to the lack of bike paths on some roads like lakeshore? Or other stuff too?
I also bike there often, no vehicle goes under 50 km/h. More like 80 to 100. Try that and you‚Äôll get a queue of angry pickups behind you. And I never saw any radar.
Je suis d'accord avec vous. J'habite sur un de ces  stretchs de l'√Æle-Bizard et c'est hyper chiant.
Toutes mes condol√©ances √† la famille.
Bord du lac in Ile Bizard in some spots barely fits two cars side by side as it is.  It's an awful road for drivers and cyclists to have to share.
29 years old, my money's on texting. It's retarded how many people of my generation I see taking snaps, not even looking at the road while driving. What's even more infuriating is that our phones absolutely know when we drive, they should not allow you to use your phone easily while driving
It's a long stretch of road with no stops, no speed bumps. It's not surprising at all that speed was a factor.
IF that road is so important for through traffic, then the city should build a physically separated bike lane and pedestrian lane.
If the road is just a park road though, then the city should install speed bumps and other speed reducing features.
Same, I used to drive along l'Anse-A-L'Orme to go to highschool for 5 years.
There's absolutely no excuse. NONE. She was 100% speeding or texting while driving. It's EXTREMELY easy to navigate on that road.
I remember back when I was a kid, other rich kids from College Charlemagne used to race on that road.
Between the possibility that she was speeding her ass off and the possibility that she had her face buried in her Instagram feed, I wonder if we're looking at another Emma Czornobaj type of trial.
There's a similar road heading to my sisters place, nice quiet narrow backroad, people speed SO much on them, there's regularly accidents around curves or turns because of this. Allow people the space to break the rules and they sure as hell will.
I know, it's a bit crazy there but I've never had really scary moments. I haven't been around there lately...however, there are some speeders and crazy drivers.
They are bending over backwards to not anger car addicts

I don‚Äôt know why everyone‚Äôs getting hung up semantics here. ‚ÄúStruck by car‚Äù is perfectly fine. 
If we say ‚Äúwoman killed by blow to head with baseball bat‚Äù you morons would be complaining that the baseball bat didn‚Äôt kill her the person who swung it did. We know that. It‚Äôs implied.
Yes that's implied.
Not sure why you hope that. What's done is done. Hopefully they figure out just what happened, so that they can mete out the appropriate punishment if any. There's always the chance that it wasn't negligent operation on the driver's part... it could have been a mechanical malfunction of the car. That would be really tragic. One innocent life lost and another one scarred.
There are a lot of dumb, impulsive people out there.
Talking about the West Island in particular, at some times of day you'll see quite a few people doing damn near 70 km/h on Boul. Des Sources or St-Jean, which are zoned at 50 km/h for their entire lengths.

It was at quarter after noon, full daylight.
It's an unpopular opinion but so true. I go out of my way to pass cyclists at a safe distance, even when they're riding in the street and avoiding the bike path 5 feet away. I slam on the brakes when they come flying down a side street, skip their stop sign, and dart right in front of my moving car. I am careful to spot the cyclists dressed all in black with no reflectors at nighttime and give them an extra wide berth.
I truly don't want to maim you, cyclists. Please stop making it so hard...
Traffic light...stop sign...I dare a cyclist to stop fully at either...even I slow down through then when I bike and I would never be like this in a car.

You mean Verdun. 
My sister hates when I remind her that despite living on Nun's Island that she's part of Verdun. Fucking postal code snobs.
damn that'd be a nice fishing spot
Looks pretty sturdy

North of the island, right under the bridge off the bicycle path, there's a path around the base of the bridge. Here: https://www.google.com/maps/place/45%C2%B028'13.9%22N+73%C2%B032'06.8%22W/@45.470534,-73.5357662,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d45.4705343!4d-73.5352187
But isnt this literally on nuns island?
And Verdun is part of Montreal which is part of Quebec, but saying this is in Quebec or Verdun doesn't help to locate the actual place... It is literally on the island.
L'Ile has the worst fucking people in the city. I work there and the snobbery and entitlement is off the chart, I know people who relocated because they couldnt stand the assholes client we got. They all seem to think they are all super cool because they have money.
I am not familiar with the history of this issue, what's wrong with being part of Verdun?
nun's island used to be like that, but lots of diversity in recent years
That‚Äôs like correcting someone who says they live in pierrefonds and saying ‚Äúno, you mean Montreal‚Äù.
You‚Äôre being annoyingly obtuse and pedantic and I‚Äôd be willing to bet a lot of people dislike you immensely.
People who are like this are the worst.
‚ÄúAhhhhkshually!‚Äù
Nobody cares about the semantics of this. Nobody is going to say ‚ÄúI live in Verdun‚Äù who lives on that island - and yes, we all realize that it‚Äôs technically part of the same borough.

Thanks so much!
Nuns island is part of Verdun.
Literally yes. But there is no longer a cloister of nuns living there, and I just enjoy reminding my sister and others that it really is part of Verdun.
‚ÄúWhere is this place?‚Äù
‚ÄúQuebec‚Äù
‚ÄúWow great, thanks‚Äù
I‚Äôve lived on nuns island basically my whole life. There are a few people like that, just like *basically everywhere*. The normal people just don‚Äôt draw attention to themselves, so of course you‚Äôre going to remember the worst, especially when you already hold a prejudice against them.
If you actually compare similar homes on Nuns Island vs Verdun you will see it is cheaper to live on Nuns Island. The island just has a lot more high end homes built more recently. 
Nuns Island has tons of rental units available for under $2k for 2db, 2bth and parking. Try finding this in Verdun.
Nun's Island is a shithole, they should be happy to be included as a part of Verdun. Verdun has a lot more going for it than Nun's Island ever did.
[deleted]
The stereotype is that everyone in ids is rich and snob and doesn't want to be associated with the Verdun plebs. Tbh though not everyone is rich (lol, not me) or snob so don't lump us all in the same basket. I do feel it's important to tell people I live on the island and not in actual Verdun because otherwise they don't understand when I don't wanna go out on Sundays because the bus schedule is shit (I wasn't kidding when I said I'm not rich!).
Absolutely nothing except if you live on Ile des Soeurs. They're like vegans who insist on telling you despite the fact it's not relevant.
Serious difference in avg income, quality of homes, services.  Folks on nuns island don't want to be associated with verdun.  At least the ones that care.

Take a chill pill mon coco, √ßa vient vraiment te chercher au plus profond de ton esspertise en g√©rance d'estrade. Je reprends des propos d'un soudeur monteur, j'ai m√™me ajout√© un "suppos√©ment", √ßa vaut ce que √ßa vaut.
That‚Äôs the city, but the actual island is called Nun‚Äôs Island, so you can be IN Verdun while being ON Nun‚Äôs Island.
Who cares? Why would you correct for that. You're not wrong, youre just an asshole
C'est comme corriger quelqu'un qui dit qu'il est dans le Vieux-Montr√©al en disant qu'il est dans Ville-Marie, c'est correcte, mais juste fucking stupide.
True.
I don't think I met everyone on nuns island, but the ones I met are incredibly snobby and give the whole place a "nice" reputation.
(The type that judge you because you're only driving a Mitsubishi instead of a BMW.)
Of course I know it's not everyone (I was visiting a friend who's not snobby), but it's a general vibe you get even at the grocery store where cashiers seem to judge you when you buy something of a cheaper brand.
Our island is a weird combination of multi-million homes and us plebs in the thousands if rental units right next door. My kids came back from school a few times asking why we don't have a Tesla or a chalet in the mountains like X and Y in their class.
This thread is tops! ü•≤üçø
Just to keep the magic going - NDG > Westmount because they have cheaper housing...
I'm not rich by any stretch of the imagination. I use "Verdun, Qc" when I give my address. But I tell people I live specifically on nuns island just because it's so geographically detached from the rest of the city and sometimes hard to access/exit because of the only 2 bridges and endless roadwork around them.
Des propos de g√©rant d'estrade avec un dipl√¥me dans le sujet. 
Un "suppos√©ment" annule pas la bullshit du reste du paragraphe.
Welcome to blocked.
>youre just an asshole
So you've based your worthless opinion on me based on one sentence? How intelligent.
Perso je corrige les gens qui disent qui vont manger sur saint-paul dans le vieux-port
>mais juste fucking stupide.
Use your adult words next time.
I see you're from Ile Dorval and not that wretched Dorval. Good for you. I live on Ile Perrot but not in Ile Perrot so I better make sure everyone knows.
I mean... I hear you, but I think if the vast majority of people you meet on the island give you that impression, maybe it‚Äôs insecurity in oneself? Like I said, I grew up here, my parents are low middle class income, definitely had more than some of my friends from Verdun with parents on welfare growing up. But everyone who works at the grocery store, the cashiers etc don‚Äôt look in the slightest bit snobby to me- maybe a little at the IGA but they‚Äôre in uniform. I‚Äôve felt more judged in other parts of Montreal. I dress like a complete stinky hobo, live in a crappy but cozy apt for under $1000 too and no one has ever lifted their nose up at me except a couple snobby grannies over the years.
I'm curious, I've always used verdun, QC for my shipping address but aren't we supposed to use Montr√©al, QC?
I'm still living in the 80s...
√áa t'arrive souvent de p√©ter des coches comme √ßa lors de discussions triviales, ou tu gardes √ßa sainement que pour l'internet tes mont√©es de lait?
that sentence doesnt define you, b; I dont define you. But take the hint, roll it back an inch, and keep on truckin! Positive vibes only dawg!
Oh, I don't deny there might be a slight insecurity on my part, I only shared the general feeling I got.
Looks like people "know" you're not from there and look at you in a weird way. But the same could be said of any BMW/cadillac driver (or cyclist with the stretch suit) around Montreal who believe they own the soil they drive/cycle on.
(I never said it affected me, tho..  I just noticed it.)
Fait int√©ressant, malgr√© que les mus√©es soient ferm√©s √† cause de covid, les galeries priv√©es sont ouvertes pour leurs expositions (certaines sur rendez-vous). J'ai vu une belle expo de Fran√ßoise Sullivan il y a quelques semaines, √ßa met un peu de couleurs dans nos vies poches.
Wow, another British Columbian! 
Welcome to Qu√©bec!
You might start hating the snow as the winter goes on.... but don't worry, we all do haha! Still beautiful every year! And if you do start hating it, don't worry! Spring is on its way
Welcome to Montreal! Cool painting btw
it captures the vibe on rene levesque really well
Welcome to Montreal! I liked your rainy day paintings of Vancouver, it's good to see you bringing that to this old city.
very nice job - may I know location?
Nice!
Fantastic! Makes me longing even more to go back downtown every day and lose myself discovering new place. I think the lighting perfectly captures the dual calmness and wonder of montr√©al.
Keep on on painting, you are really good. :) That's the kind of things I would like on my walls!
I can't imagine how much more you would love this place if it was a normal year and not 2020.
This is lovely!
Sheesh, I wish I had money to go live in BC, but indeed, I guess you'd still be there if it wasn't so expensive, eh?
What a beautiful depiction of Montreal's downtown at night! It's very cozy :)
Omg this is amazing! Can you contact me for a portrait commission??
Do you have a website where you sell these? This is lovely.
I like this a lot lot lot.
I know this place lol
Don‚Äôt speak for everyone. :) I hate snowless winters, the most depressing thing ever
Thanks! I'm actually excited for the snow - I've spent a lot of time up north and in the mountains, so I'm keen to have it at home in a place that actually knows how to plow its streets!
Looks like the Maisonneuve bike path to me.
Thanks!
Sorry, I wish I could give you the exact intersection, but I took the reference photo I used on my DSLR and it doesn't log location data! I'm not familiar enough with the particular regions yet to know exactly where, other than it was somewhere in/close to Downtown
Hey, thanks! Yeah, while it's weird to relocate during COVID, I'm enjoying the focus it's put on me exploring in 'safe' ways. I've been lucky to spend a ton of time on foot just wandering and getting a sense of place here. It's a beautiful city!
Same! I've got friends here (also working in creative industries) who have made it their mission to let me know exactly what I'm missing, haha. I'm looking forward to maybe SOME degree of normal next summer!
Actually, no! The insane cost of living certainly factored into it, but Vancouver lacks a lots of what makes a city a 'city' and relies on it's outdoor activities as attractions... which, when you lack the time or finances to take advantage of them, makes life difficult. I'm both very arts- and culture-focused as well as very outdoorsy, and even having been doing well financially there, I still had to fight to find the time or money to enjoy my surroundings. Even in the era of COVID, I've found this city (in the tiny amount of time I've been here) more accomodating and appreciative of the arts, so that's an improvement already! It's so nice to be around a populace that, on average, seems to appreciate the finer things in life more.
Thanks! I do [here](http://sarahafskoven.bigcartel.com) :)
Snow is great, heavy snow accumulation is great only on mountains. But you're right: Nothing sucks more than Nov-Early Dec weather
If that's the case, I guess it's far from what you'd find in BC but Montreal has plenty of fine ski hills spread around, you should give them a look. Some less than 1 hour away!   
Coming from Manitoba they certainly made me enjoy last winter way more than the previous ones, and now I'm actually looking forward for the snow!
Also worth checking, the city maintains some great public skate rings, which might have not been an option depending on where you were in BC
Everyone talks about hating the snow but I'm also a west coaster who came to the east. I just remember to keep a positive attitude and the snow is never as bad as people make it out to be!
Also once you've experienced a single summer in Montreal with no AC you will NEVER complain about the cold again.
Yeah, i feel like I'm at Maisonneuve and Metcalfe, looking towards McGill College.
Well, keep painting.  You are very talented and hope you continue to enjoy Montreal.
I was in Vancouver first time ever last august (and outside Qu√©bec and Ontario when it comes down to Canada), city was beautiful, but I did found a "beverly hiƒ∫ls" vibe where I feel like I'd really need big money (basically saving money way more than I do here) to be able to "mix" with people more confidently in vancouver... but again, just a vibe for the 5 days I was there.
I've written a ton about this in very similar tones as well OP. Moved here from Abbotsford five years ago.
I was considering Vancouver since I used to visit fairly regularly for culture & activities, but I only had to visit Montreal once to fall in love with the city.
The inaffordability there makes it really worse, but at it's core it's kinda a sleepy town that grew big quickly. It lacks, I find, the sort of world-facing metropolitanism I find otherwise in an older city like Montreal.
People are content not being too ambitious. Doing interesting things in life is secondary to making money, and that too mostly because living there has become so expensive.
It used to be the city to go to for a easy, quiet life. Enjoying nature, raising your kids. I still think it hasn't much moved beyond that, but it's just become quite hard to even have that.
I imagine you grew up there as well, but as a transplant to Vancouver itself, being that I was an international student and then immigrant, I found it quite isolating as a city. Even though I had regular events I participated in and got to meet a lot of people, it was a hard place in getting past the cliques people had already established for themselves.
I do miss the nature though, but I feel like people actually get out as part of their regular life a lot more here. Vancouver and environs have a lot of people who talk about the outdoors more than they actually partake. There's a few hardcore that totally _abuse_ the advantage of living next to such world-class nature; good for them. I've always been more into culture and I love living in Canada's biggest Francophone city, it's cultural heart etc.
Worse is that agonizing 2 months where spring is just muddy and gross and we all waiting for the temperature to go back up and the plants to grow.
That lasts for 2 weeks, then we're melting.
Thanks! I think I will (in every regard)
I totally agree, and I've spent most of my life there! Every niche community is rather restricted (whether they mean to be or not) by your connections to that community, so it's hard for anyone to find their niche without squeezing their way in via events (which are often expensive) and strong social skills. It takes tons of effort to find one's way into good company outside of coworkers. I was lucky to find any degree of success in the arts the way I did, and that took more networking than any of my friends in classically higher-paying fields abroad. Vancouver is a wonderful place to vacation if you have the funds to travel between the mountains and beach... but it's far from comfortably liveable.
You've hit the nail on the head here!
I did grow up in the greater Vancouver region, but moved so much through the city and the suburbs as a child/young adult that I never really put roots down and therefore found my 'clique'. It is a very exclusionary region. 
I miss the nature, too - I used to run trail races, once upon a time - but I found so much lacking in my day-to-day life that not having quick access to the North   Shore mountains is a worthy sacrifice. You're right: people here do get outdoors far more! I hated that, in Vancouver, you either had to live directly in one of the 'artsy' neighbourhoods or regularly drive/take public transport to get anywhere with galleries or artists or live music (when that was a thing), or even some basic life needs. Here, I get every amenity I could possibly require within 20-30 minutes of walking. Public galleries might be concentrated in a certain area, but there's no shortage of private galleries spread out across the city, and while indoor concerts might be prohibited right now, I've certainly seen the signage around everywhere.
It's nice to hear someone reflect my thoughts on this change! I love having the opportunity to improve my still-terrible conversational French (because the West Coast, at best, teaches you to read well and nothing else). I love the culture and the pride people here take in their surroundings. I don't know that anywhere quite feels like home to me, but this city definitely feels welcoming!
I understand that those silo represent a historical moment of industrial activity in the Old Port... But really aren't they more of an eyesore than anything else?
Not every "historical" thing should be preserved.
Ugly and a waste of space.
Make this area a park or something nice..
Or let artists paint the building and build some restaurants and activities into it, adding balconies and more.
I live nearby, and have grown really fond of it.
It is one of the worlds first reinforced concrete structures of its scale, it turned Montreal into Canada‚Äôs grain hub during the war, and could accept stock from land, sea, and rail at the same time. 
Frankly, I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs ugly. No more so than a rocky cliff, which most people find beautiful.
La vue depuis le toit est merveilleuse :D
So beautiful, dont touch my silo!
I love it. I think it‚Äôs got character. I would much rather look at this then a new condo building or some other generic building. This silo is part of the city‚Äôs history and I believe it should be preserved. But that‚Äôs just me.
This ugly rusty pile of concrete should be destroyed. You cannot do anything secure out of it. What a waste of usefull space on the old port. Give it back to the public as a parc with outdoor street food!
You‚Äôre not wrong but i‚Äôve had great memories in and around the Silo. It would feel weird if it got replaced by Condo‚Äôs
I dunno, i love it!
Honestly I kinda like it
Canada maltage it‚Äôs actually a big company that use the silos they are making malt for all the big beer companies
Yeah, it's such a shame they're just letting it rot like this. I wish they could've turned it into something useful where we'd be allowed to go inside. I'd definitely be down for another historical museum.
Thanks for  the additional info! 
It‚Äôs definitely a love/hate kinda thing.
Personally, I'd rather look at this badass relic from the industrial age rather than having the place invaded by $12 gril cheese food trucks, but i do have a major fondness for old industrial behemoths like this beauty. I just love walking around this thing, looking at it..
It could be used for Google's Data Center purposes, instead of wiping out forests on the south shore for a new building.
Isn't Canada Maltage located right by Five Roses though? (You pass right by it when you take the section of the bike track that goes under the Bonaventure highway towards Cit√© du Havre and the islands).
Oui
De toute fa√ßon, bient√¥t 80% des travailleurs de Montr√©al vivront en banlieue tellement l'immobillier devient hors de prix
I'm originally from Minneapolis where obviously there's been a lot of recent discussion of police reform due to George Floyd and other less nationally known cases (Philando Castille, Justine Damond, etc). We have the same issue of suburbanites playing soldier downtown. I don't perceive things as being equally bad in Montreal as back home but residency requirements for police was one of the options floated to make cops more connected with the communities they're supposed to protect. Wonder if that could be done here.
j'essaie pas d'excuser la situation, mais je serai surpris du % des employes municipaux qui demeurent a l'exterieur de la viller pour la quelle il/elle travail
I mean ok, but also...so do a ton of people in their 30s/40s/50s because who the hell can afford a family sized place in Montreal anyway. No shit.
Normal, c'est dur d'acheter √† Montr√©al m√™me avec un salaire de policier.
Un policier du Plateau va avoir beaucoup de mis√®re √† trouver quelque chose qu'il va pouvoir s'offrir par exemple.
Pas surprenant, et √ßa explique potentiellement beaucoup de choses.

If I was a cop the very last thing would be to live where I work. It only makes sense to not be recognized and live far away, same goes for any law enforcement profession.
In some places this is done on purpose, so police don‚Äôt have ties to the neighbourhoods where they work, makes it easier to act like garbage when you don‚Äôt have to face the neighbours / beat on people you know.
Je ne critique pas les policiers pour ces choix. Par contre, je ne peut pas m'emp√™cher de penser que si les policier vivaient sur l'√Æle, il y aurait peut √™tre une meilleur compr√©hension des gens donc ils sont suppos√©s prot√©ger. 
Lire √ßa me rappelle des nombreux √©tudes que j'ai lu a travers les ann√©es sur le "Community policing" mais surtout [cette](https://youtu.be/BA5za4VsskM) sc√®ne dans la s√©rie The Wire.
Il ne nous repr√©sentent pas dans notre diversit√©, dans notre mode de vie, etc. C'est bien dommage.
It's just all the rental properties they own that are in the city.
All it takes is a weight on the location during your online application. If you LIVE IN MONTREAL while you apply, but decide to move out after, it should have no weight.
Why am I not surprised.
Si j'√©tais policier, moi aussi j'√©viterais d'habiter dans mon quartier de poste. Pas envie qu'on me reconnaisse √† l'√©picerie avec mes enfants, √ßa peut √™tre dangereux.
Je suis sur que ces stats sont pire √† la STM.
Faites le d√©compte pour les cols bleus et la STM, √ßa risque de n'√™tre pas si diff√©rent.
Pas certain que tu veux √™tre police pis habiter pas loin de ta job pis croiser certains des tes *clients* en faisant ton √©picerie
Sans surprise, c‚Äôest et √ßa a √©t√© le cas partout depuis toujours.
Mais c'est un peu con comme statistique.  Si les prix augement pour les maisons √† Montr√©al, est-ce que les policiers sont oblig√© √† payer pour des maisons plus chers?
Bin oui parce que tout le monde qui travail dans le centre-ville doivent/peuvent habiter la. Ou westmount, ville mtl-royal etc... Du grand journalisme.
Large reason why it is it‚Äôs hard to buy in Montreal on cuntstable pay and then you run into the risk of seeing the vermin you arrested when you‚Äôre off duty
**Probl√®me:** Comportement des policiers (aggressif, condescendant, brusque et violent, etc.)
**Solution:** R√©percussion s√©v√®re envers les mauvais policiers (cong√©diement, cong√© sans solde, etc) et body cam. 
**Fausse solution:** FO KI FASSE LEUR √âPICERIE AK LES GENS QU'ILS SURVEILLENT. FO KI JOUE O BASKET ET QU'ILS RISENT COMME DANS UN CLIP DE FILM DES ANN√âES 1980 ET MON FEED TIKTOK.
Et s√ªrement 100% des policiers de NYC‚Ä¶ c‚Äôest rien de surprenant
Je pense que tu as pas le droit de travailler ou tu habites
Ok... et les policiers votent probablement pour la CAQ, et jamais pour QS. C'est assez logique qu'ils habitent en banlieue.
Montr√©al est per√ßue, souvent √† juste titre, comme une ville d'intellos, d'artistes et de professionnels plut√¥t √† gauche. Le probl√®me, c'est Montr√©al qui est devenue polaris√©e. On a juste √† regarder une carte √©lectorale pour s'en apercevoir.
Faut pas attirer des banlieusards √† Montr√©al. Faut plut√¥t convaincre des Montr√©alais de s'orienter vers les forces polici√®res... Et ce serait un exploit.
Et c'est juste les patrons qui occupent les maisons √† Montr√©al? L'√Æle des boss.
T'inqui√®te la banlieue aussi devient hors de prix
hmmm en banlieur ici ca la augment√© de 38% en 1 an... so c'est pu vraiment achetable ici non plus
[deleted]
That's a really interesting point, I think being integrated in the actual community of the city being promoted and encouraged could really help steer away from the us Vs. them mentality. I genuinely feel the regard of regular citizens being unfavourable by police in most interactions with SPVM officers I've had. I hope relations improve!
> suburbanites playing soldier downtown.
Best TL;DR.
One risk factor is that you don't really want your cop to meet his "customers" (ce qu'on appelle la client√®le) when he's off duty. That's a safety / harassment risk for both sides.
That said, same city doesn't mean same neighbourhood, so that would probably be an acceptable demand.
>Wonder if that could be done here.
Short answer, no. The SCC has ruled that employers cannot force residency requirements on an employee. It would need to be done through some kind of incentive. 
Realistically, houses in the suburbs on the island are beyond the pay scale of a police officer these days, so they move off the island.  
There's also the fact that the problem areas tend to be poorer and more dangerous to live in, so nobody making a decent salary would actually choose to live there and you kind of reach an impasse with this idea.
A Montreal cop literally kneeled on a black teens neck the other day. Pretty sure our cops are just as bad unfortunately
I understand some of what you're saying here but do you really want to force a worker to live in a part of town he or she may not be able to afford, just so they can have a job?  Downtown residency is generally for doctors, lawyers, trust fund babies and the wealthy.  If the housing is affordable anywhere downtown, it is probably substandard.
Pas mal 50 / 50 je crois.
Mais je crois aussi que y‚Äôa une r√®gle que le policier peux pas patrouiller dans la m√™me ville qu‚Äôil habite
Except police are paid very well, have great job security, have great pensions and need to be held to a higher standard generally. I don't care if my dentist lives off the island.
Le policier moyen gagne beaucoup plus que l'habitant moyen du Plateau. Ou le Montr√©alais moyen. Le Montr√©alais moyen habite sur l'√Æle lui, malgr√© les prix et moins d'argent. Faudrait se demander pourquoi la police n'attire pas les Montr√©alais comme profession.
Oui et la valeur moyenne d'une propri√©t√©, par exemple √† Outremont est au dessus de 2M$
Donc on oublie VMR, Outremont, Westmount et bien des secteurs de Ahuntsic, des larges pans du west-island et presque partout pr√®s des cours d'eau.
Comme quoi?
Do you think caf√© workers in Manhattan have walkups off of central park?  Zero chance.  They are subway'ing in from another burough or even beyond.  This has to do with affordability.
Exactly. You know those news stories or situations in movies where some crazy thing happened but someone's like "Don't worry! I'm an off-duty cop! Not going to allow this behaviour in *my neighbourhood*!" And saves the day?! That likely hood is 20% vs other cities! 
Not to mention if this continues to be the case, the % of retired cops is likely also a tiny number!
Comme quoi? Qu'ils sont pogn√© dans le traffic eux aussi?
Might be the logic behind it, but a lot of people who live outside Montreal don't like the city and its inhabitants, so they're probably policing with that attitude. Plus, there's no sense of community. They don't care what happens either way, so it doesn't change anything for them if they antagonize people.
Edit: spelling
Says something about the nature of the job, doesn‚Äôt it?
I think it would be _better_ if they had ties to the community, understood the locals and local issues. I think their approach would be less violent, and there would be more cooperation between residents and the police.
> If I was a cop the very last thing would be to live where I work. It only makes sense to not be recognized and live far away
Imagine wanting to be a cop and being afraid of the people you serve. I mean, it explains a lot, but it's still pretty pathetic.
The very last thing you would want is accountability as an enforcer of the law in your community? Sounds like a cop alright.

Isn‚Äôt this type of thing why we have the Amber Alert, what the hell?!
so Quebec will be using Amber alert to remind people to obey curfew or they will be fined but won't use it for a missing kid?
WTF?
I would check police dashcams they used to drive aboriginal woman to remote places and take their winter coats so they have to walk back in winter, as punishment for being drunk, maybe they did to her also
Maybe dont wait 5 days to tell? ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The public  should know about the circonstance prior to her going missing ...how can we find her or think like a 13 yo girl ... 
13 in 2021 is not the 13 .. 1988 ..
She left with no winter coat so is it a possible familial dispute ? 
We need to know what happend ?? 
Montreal police probably think she just a frustrated teenager who just runaway ..no big deal ...
I really hope they find her, I hope she is okay
Just go ahead and add her name to the ever-growing list of MMIWG...
These articles make me ask what I could do to help. I'm an expat on a work permit, which makes it difficult (I can't foster until I get my PR). Ideally I'd like to support young mothers, I don't know if there a any programs specifically for that. Though really open to anything

Quel genre de photo c'est √ßa. On peut tu voir de quoi elle a l'air autrement que avec un mugshot ou elle a l'air d'avoir 40 ans

No, an AMBER alert has three specific criteria:
> 1. The police have reason to believe that the missing child (someone under 18 years of age) has been abducted
2. The police have reason to believe that the physical safety or the life of the child is in serious danger
3. The police have information that may help locate the child, the suspect and/or the suspect's vehicle
its total bullshit. also why are we just hearing about this now
Thats awful
They probably reached their work quota for the month that day, so they didn't care much about it. üôÑ
Or the person reporting it did it with a completely lazy/useless officer; too busy cherry picking cases.
> EDITOR'S NOTE: CBC has removed the name and photo from this story. Now that this person is no longer missing, the identity is no longer in the public interest.
I think evil lurks closer from hone

"Cecire frequented downtown Montreal, police say, and investigators have reason to fear for her safety."
C'est qui qui laisse sa fille de 13 ans "frequenter le montreal downtown" ?
Well, the 3 criteria seems to be checked. She is under 18 y.o., they fear for her safety and they have her description and her last location. I feel like they were Amber alert for much less...
[deleted]
[deleted]
Thank you for letting us know!
Is that unreasonable? It's not clear to me what time of day this was nor how far from her home downtown montreal would be.
They probably don't have reason to believe she was abducted, which is needed to issue an amber alert
Note that AMBER alerts for abducted children are just one use of the emergency notification system. If you were listening to the (broadcast) radio while driving you would get the same alert. 
People complain enough about receiving emergency notifications for AMBER alerts meeting the strict criteria, can you imagine the response if you got one for every missing persons case?
Humans can be fucking vile
I would absolutely never let my daughters "hang out" downtown at 13 !
( In addition to the fact that we're under a lockdown for month and should not "hang out" with anyone anywhere )
shes 13 and on the streets for days, i cant think of another explanation.
No arguments here about hanging out during the pandemic.
But that aside, some people live downtown. Clearly a 13 year old who lives downtown could hang out downtown. To my mind, the question is if downtown is 2 streets over or 2 towns over.
[deleted]
Abduction means she would have to have been forcibly taken by someone against her will. I‚Äôm not saying this definitely didn‚Äôt happen, but it‚Äôs not the only explanation. She could be somewhere safe voluntarily, somewhere unsafe voluntarily, or even somewhere unsafe involuntarily, but unless she was taken there against her will, it wouldn‚Äôt be considered an abduction and therefore wouldn‚Äôt meet the amber alert criteria.
There‚Äôs also the tragic possibilities of suicide, homicide, or accidental death.
Yes the public should be made aware and significant resources be dedicated towards finding her, because a 13 year old missing for almost a week without a coat in the middle of winter is very concerning, but unfortunately amber alert criteria is very specific.
there's no where to run. she is either in someones home, or on the streets. the streets is not really possible since it was like -20C the past few days not to mention the curfew. best case scenario an adult is knowingly allowing this which could still easily be seen as abducted. we are dealing with a very fine line here and considering her age, i wouldnt be playing around with words and just take it serious.
[deleted]
i never implied otherwise. never thought id have to clarify this. lol
You didn't it was very clear.
Incidemment, par la suite, l'attach√© politique de Ensemble Montr√©al a d√©cid√© de supprimer son compte Twitter.
Ma th√©orie est que le timing √©tait mauvais pour d√©voiler leur strat√©gie politique bas√©e sur un sondage, alors qu'on enqu√™tait sur 233 morts en Colombie-Britannique par la canicule.
En vrai ! Son sondage pouvait aussi ne pas avoir "changements climatiques" comme choix de r√©ponse. Cest aussi con que √ßa. 
√âgalement, si le parti avait pas de projet climatique avant davoir fait un sondage √ßa perd en cr√©dibilit√©
Je remarque que la lutte contre la corruption non plus ce n'est pas sur leur radar.
Happy to see they intend on governing surveys and not people
Je comprend maintenant pourquoi on devient plus cynique en vieillissant. C'est un m√©canisme de d√©fense. On va tous crever √† cause de l'inaction du gouvernement, et il y a peu de chose que je puisse faire en tant qu'individu... Alors je commence √† en rire. Parce que je suis tann√© de me stresser pour des choses sur lesquelles j'ai l'impression d'avoir aucun contr√¥le. Le cynisme comme moyen de conserver une sant√© mentale.
MAIS QUEL IDIOT!
Le gars parfait pour repr√©senter Coderre...
Quel caaaaave ahahaha
Aussi, il y a le transport en commun et les pistes cyclables dans la liste. Du point de vue changements climatiques, ce sont pas mal des enjeux capitaux.
Il sait que c‚Äô√©tait une question en public et pas un brainstorming a l'interne pour la campagne?
*figurent
Le m√™me gars que quand il √©tait journaliste faisait une job de bras pour Coderre. Ensuite nomm√© attach√© politique, c'est beau les co√Øncidences pareilles.
Je poserais ceci de positif par contre. Il y a quelque chose d'incroyablement positif √† se faire r√©pondre honn√™tement dans un contexte comme celui-l√†. C'est vraiment quand la classe politique nous dit la v√©rit√© qu'on peut le plus facilement juger de leur valeur r√©elle.
Au risque de me faire n√©gavoter ; quels seraient les projets au niveau municipal qui feraient un effet (significatif) pour contrer les changements climatiques? L'√©lectrification du transport en commun?
Je vois d√©finitivement un impact potentiel de projets √† grande √©chelle et de l√©gislation au niveau provincial et f√©d√©ral mais soyons r√©alistes... construire des pistes cyclables c'est plus une question de qualit√© de vie et de bon d√©veloppement urbain plut√¥t qu'un projet contre les changements climatiques.
edit : Mettons le code du batiment qui forcerait l'installation de bornes √©lectriques pour les nouveaux condos, c'est de juridiction provinciale ou municipale √ßa?
S'il vous pla√Æt ne votez pas Coderre, Coderre au pouvoir √ßa serait terrible. √áa laisserait une marque sur la ville
Quand m√™me hilarant qu'il se fasse fusiller parce qu'il a accidentellement dit tout haut la strat√©gie de tous les partis politiques depuis 80 ans au Qu√©bec et ailleurs.
Belle faute de fran√ßais.
C'est dr√¥le, il y a beaucoup des enjeux qui se rattachent directement aux changements climatiques et l'environement.
Guillaume Pelletier ne semble pas √™tre un √©l√©ment √† prioriser pour Montr√©al non plus.
Le mec a bien mang√© aujourd'hui, faque c'est pas la peine de soucier de la faim dans le monde.
ne figurent*
Je sais pour qui je ne voterai pas
C'est marrant, ya aussi un Guillaume Peltier aussi en France et c'est aussi un d√©bile de droite qui essaye de draguer des boomers.
Bonne affaire!
Political faux pas
Dommage qu'on semble ne pas se soucier que les gouvernements avec les pouvoirs et responsabilit√©s de faire quelque chose en environnement (CAQ et PLC) ne font rien
Et concr√®tement, je ne vois pas ce que le gouvernement Plante a fait de positif dans le dossier environnemental avec l'exode vers les banlieues qui a lieu en ce moment √† cause de la crise du logement et des probl√®mes de qualit√© de vie en ville.
Qu'est-ce que les √©lus municipaux de Montr√©al peuvent faire contre le r√©chauffement climatique? Rien. 
Ce qu'ils peuvent faire, c'est am√©liorer les transports en commun et les services de recyclage de d√©chet. Ca changera rien au r√©chauffement climatique... donc, non, le r√©chauffement climatique, c'est pas un probl√®me que Montr√©al peut r√©gler ou m√™me y avoir un impact notable.
Tbk c'est juste la chaleur.... On est m√™me pas rendu √† la stage de famine etc
Sans vouloir faire dans le d√©ni climatique, ce n'est pas encore prouv√© que cette vague de chaleur est due au r√©chauffement climatique. C'est possiblement une anomalie qui survient tr√®s rarement. Il y a donc corr√©lation, mais pas encore de preuve de causalit√©.
D'ailleurs, √ßa reste un sondage qu'on r√©pond en fonction des craintes du moment.
Tu demandes √ßa pendant l'hiver avec le Covid et le confinement, alors le d√©veloppement √©conomique est important, et la piste cyclable sous la neige ne l'est pas. Tu demandes √ßa en ce moment quand il y a une reprise √©conomique visible mais des centaines de morts au Canada parce qu'on cuit √† 50 degr√©s Celsius, la r√©ponse change.
C'est ca la politique. Pas de vrai convictions, on sonde la conscience populaire pour savoir ce qu'on doit promettre pour gagner la confiance et les votes de la population pour ensuite faire whatever the fuck we wanted in the first place.
En plus, si on regarde les chiffres dans la sondage, la moiti√© des r√©pondants sont dans la cat√©gorie de 65+...
Serais tu en train d'insinuer que ce politicien fait preuve de mauvaise foi toi la la ?
C'est Coderre, il a encore de la cr√©dibilit√© √† perdre?
Les pompiers vont pas commencer √† s‚Äôarroser eux-m√™mes.
Tu crois qu'il reste beaucoup de corruption?
>On va tous crever √† cause de l'inaction du gouvernement, 
Je t'encourage √† t'impliquer avec les mouvements √©colos qui mettent de la pression sur les gouvernements et qui font des actions directes (Extinction Rebellion, Greenpeace, ou celui qui te tente le plus).
C'est loin d'√™tre s√ªr que √ßa va marcher, mais ne rien faire, c'est accepter qu'on s'en va dans le mur.
[*Ce monde est une com√©die pour ceux qui pensent, une trag√©die pour ceux qui \[res\]sentent.*](https://citations.ouest-france.fr/citation-horace-walpole/monde-comedie-pensent-tragedie-sentent-40005.html)  
**Horace Walpole**
Le gouvernement c'est nous. Si la population n'a aucune vision et se concentre sur leur petite vie individuelle et leurs petits probl√®mes quotidiens, on a les politiciens qu'on m√©rites. Tu as le choix de sauver les futures g√©n√©rations en prenant des choix difficiles ou de baisser des imp√¥ts ou garder le status quo? Pour qui les gens vont voter?
Je suis d√©courag√© de la race humaine et je comprends pourquoi il y a tant de cynisme.
Le moyen de conserver ta sant√© mentale, ce n'est pas d'√™tre cynique, c'est de mod√©rer tes attentes, et de concentrer ton attention l√† ou elle compte. D'ignorer les √©l√©ments les plus n√©gatifs qui attirent un sentiment de cynisme comme les partis politiques qui ne font rien pour l'environnement et plut√¥t porter attention sur ceux qui font le travail qui importe (les scientifiques, les mouvements politiques pro environnement etc). Si tu ne fais juste que te concentrer sur les pires √©l√©ments tu arriveras √† rien. 
Le cynisme c'est une fa√ßon immature et irrationnelle de r√©agir √† l'adversit√©. C'est du pleurnichage pour ceux qui veulent pas admettre qu'ils pleurnichent. √áa ne sert √† rien.
Le citoyen moyen est trop stupide pour faire un lien entre  ces choses la.
Merci ! Quand t'as √©t√© journaliste puis attach√© politique et que tu sais pas conjuguer un verbe au pr√©sent...
J'ai quelques exemples pour toi:
-Obligation pour TOUS les nouveaux projets de d√©veloppement urbain de suivre des normes environnementales du style LEED ou ENVISION. (Qui obligent une r√©duction de d√©chets/consommation √©nerg√©tique/eau, du recyclage et des consultations publiques.)
-R√©duction/interdiction de vente de contenants a usage unique qui ne sont pas biod√©gradable ou compostable.
-Faire peinturer en blanc ou ajouter de la v√©g√©tation sur la toiture des immeubles pour r√©duire les √Ælots de chaleur en ville.
Il y en a d'autres, mais c'est ce qui me vient "on top of my head".
Effectivement, les enjeux se jouent surtout au f√©d√©ral / provincial. Pour le municipal, on peut penser √† la place de la voiture et plus largement aux alternatives de transport (nb d'espaces stationnement, pistes cyclables, Bixi, etc.). Il y a aussi l'√©talement urbain (densit√© des projets r√©sidentiels, acc√®s en transport en commun, etc.), les √Ælots de chaleur, la pr√©servation de milieux naturels, ...
Il y a beaucoup a faire au niveau municipal. Il faut prioriser la conservation d'espaces verts et de boises. Presentement il y a enormement de boises qui vont etre detruit dans les prochaines annees pour qu'on y construise des condos, alors qu'il y a enormement de terrains industriels vacants disponibles just a cote. Le secteur pres du metro assomption est un bon exemple.
Quelques id√©es:
- Tarification de toutes les places de stationnement sur rue
- Zonage pour densification
- Pi√©tonnisation d'une partie de la ville (Vieux-Montr√©al?)
- R√©duction des ilots de chaleurs
- Plus de parc, moins de rue
PLUS de transport en commun (m√™me non √©lectrifi√©s). C'est g√©n√©ralement mal d√©sservi lorsqu'on sort des quartiers centraux et √ßa force plusieurs √† utiliser leur voiture.
> mais soyons r√©alistes... construire des pistes cyclables c'est plus une question de qualit√© de vie et de bon d√©veloppement urbain plut√¥t qu'un projet contre les changements climatiques.
Si tu peux vivre √† pied/√† v√©lo, alors tu n'as plus besoin de ton auto et tu g√©n√®res moins de GES (puis si moins d'autos sont construites, moins de production de GES, etc...)
Par exemple, quand je le pouvais par le pass√©, j'allais faire l'√©picerie √† pied. Maintenant je dois prendre l'auto car je suis en r√©gion et c'est clair que je g√©n√®re beaucoup plus de GES actuellement, √† mon grand d√©sespoir.
> edit : Mettons le code du batiment qui forcerait l'installation de bornes √©lectriques pour les nouveaux condos, c'est de juridiction provinciale ou municipale √ßa?
Le provincial fait la [Loi sur l'am√©nagement et l'urbanisme](http://legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/fr/showdoc/cs/a-19.1), ensuite les MRC/grosses villes font leurs sch√©mas d'am√©nagements, puis les villes et municipalit√©s utilisent leurs sch√©mas respectifs pour √©tablir leur r√©glementation (les textes qui ont directement force de loi pour le citoyen) et s'arrimer aux sch√©mas r√©gionaux.
Sp√©cifiquement pour l'exemple que tu donnes, √ßa serait au r√®glement d'urbanisme d'une municipalit√© qu'on retrouverait cela.
Lorsque le promoteur d√©pose son projet √† la municipalit√©/ville, cela sera examin√© par une personne √† l'urbanisme et en fonction de la grosseur du projet, √ßa pourra aller d'une approbation simple √† un retour au promoteur pour changements suite √† une s√©ance d'un comit√© d'√©valuation multi-d√©partemental (genre environnement, travaux publics, urbanisme, etc...) mais typiquement √ßa passera au moins par une grille d'√©valuation pour en √©tablir la conformit√© par rapport √† tout les crit√®res qui s'appliquent √† ce projet-l√†.
Par contre, les √©lus dictent pas mal les priorit√©s car ce sont eux qui vivent avec les cons√©quences d'un r√®glement plus ou moins contraignant en terme de se faire r√©-√©lire ou pas. Si tes √©lus pensent que les citoyens veulent des beaux parcs et conserver les arbres matures, alors ils vont faire cr√©er des r√®glements pour √ßa, puis si c'est √† propos de d'autre chose, alors ce sera autre chose.
Pourquoi tu dis qu'ils ne peuvent rien faire pour ensuite donner des exemples de choses qu'ils peuvent faire?
La question porte sur les *effets* des changements climatiques. Oui, la lutte contre les changements climatiques est importante, mais faut se rendre √† l'√©vidence qu'il va falloir aussi mitiger les impacts que √ßa va avoir.
Pour une grande concentration de population comme Montr√©al, √ßa peut √™tre vraiment important. Est-ce que Montr√©al a un plan pour g√©rer des √©v√©nements climatiques extr√™mes (ex.: inondations, tornades ou orages violents, vagues de chaleur) ?
Les inondations dans l'ouest et le nord de l'√Æle les ann√©es pass√©es ont montr√© que Montr√©al √©tait vuln√©rable √† ce niveau. Et pour la chaleur, il y a eu des discussions d'avoir des navettes permettant d'amener des personnes √¢g√©es dans des lieux climatis√©s lorsque n√©cessaire. 
Je ne sais pas si Montr√©al en a r√©ellement besoin, mais je crois que √ßa vaut la peine d'√™tre discut√©.
Heh... am√©nagement du territoire, urbanisme, y'a quand m√™me des trucs. Et ils peuvent faire pression sur les autres ordres (surtout Montr√©al/Qu√©bec) pour int√©grer une strat√©gie plus globale.
Attend cet automne, que la tour d'observation soit ouverte, t'auras des vues de malades

Video from the protest that shows that arrests were more or less unprovoked: [https://youtu.be/WxgXyQerX98](https://youtu.be/WxgXyQerX98)
I followed both this protest (and the earlier far-right/conspiracist ones). The police moved in much harder on yesterday's demo than on the conspiracists, even though yesterday's protest  was peaceful (and everyone was wearing masks) while the conspiracists both refused to wear masks while they also attacked police with rock throwing.
I've wrote multiple pages on this that I never posted because I felt like I wasn't saying exactly what I wanted to say. So I'm just going to keep it brief.
&nbsp;
I'm 100% against the curfew. The Ligue des droits et libert√©s is absolutely right when they said: 
["... il est √©vident que la situation actuelle est tr√®s grave et que tout le monde doit jouer son r√¥le dans la lutte contre le coronavirus. Mais il ne suffit pas d‚Äôen faire reposer le poids sur la responsabilit√© individuelle et sur des restrictions des droits et libert√©s aussi importantes comme un couvre-feu. La responsabilit√© de l‚Äô√âtat est majeure dans cette situation extraordinaire que nous connaissons."](https://liguedesdroits.ca/communique-pandemie-couvre-feu-quebec/) 
We should absolutely be angry with the government right now. We should be angry that our liberty is being restricted because our healthcare system is underfunded and poorly prepared. We should be angry that the government has bungled their response to the pandemic over and over. We should be angry. The past year has been more than uncomfortable for me, among other things I lost my job, my passion, seen friends close their businesses, cancelled so many projects, weddings and trips. I also saw first hand as friends and family working on the front-line experienced the horrors of this pandemic in our healthcare system.
 **BUT I WILL FUCK MY SELF IN THE ASS WITH A PINEAPPLE** before I go out in a group to protest a temporary suspension of my rights when it may (however unlikely) help keep others alive.  I think it's abhorrent to choose a poorly implemented government measure as a reason to be [protesting](https://www.iheartradio.ca/image/policy:1.2572713:1548363966/J-ai-l-doua.jpg?f=default&$p$f=2649f7d)  right now. I respect that the pandemic has affected everyone differently, my experience is not yours. But if you're someone with a similar experience to mine and you're out there protesting with a false pretension of [preserving the rights](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CKTwl4AW8AAW0yt?format=jpg&name=small) of everyone I'm sure I can find a pineapple for [you](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/CleanWildCamel-mobile.mp4). So that's where I'm at.
&nbsp;
With that out of the way this is why **our curfew is a crock of shit**: Legault's night time curfew is yet another poorly implemented bastardized half measure of what we now [know](https://www.institutmolinari.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2021/03/etude-zero-covid2021_en.pdf) can be a good non-pharmaceutical response.  If our rights are going to be temporarily limited and our mental health put at risk it better be for a **fucking well thought out and scientifically supported** plan.  In fact despite the [many confounding factors](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01009-0) that make a meta-analysis of curfew efficacy difficult, [studies are showing that more restrictive curfews are effective](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33412795/). And before anyone jumps in and says "[wHaT aBouT thE eConOmY?!](https://media2.giphy.com/media/3o7aCVnK4dfDeaIkc8/giphy.gif)" data from a meta-analysis of pandemic responses suggests: 
["the costly nature of lockdowns is not lasting when they help eradicate the virus and remove the restrictions on people and economies on a sustainable basis. Meanwhile, the beneficial nature of curfews and other half-measures fades away when we see that they extend over time, multiplying the economic and social costs..."](https://www.institutmolinari.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2021/03/etude-zero-covid2021_en.pdf) 
If you want some local anecdotal confirmation that's close to my heart go send a message to any of the restaurateurs who planned to open for Easter weekend only to find out days before that we were flip-flopping back to a partial lock down again. Exemplifying once again the weak leadership pattern of: *half-meausure* -> *cases somewhat decrease* -> *popular decision* -> *cases increase* -> *half measure*.
&nbsp;
I think the way that Legault has implemented it is only going to compound the conditions by packing people into metros/groceries/parks in more limited hours. The nighttime curfew is the worst of the [yo-yo game](https://thetyee.ca/Analysis/2021/04/17/Canada-Crazy-Pandemic-Response/), half measure bullshit that Legault has been playing. The entire pandemic he has been talking about "balance"; mental vs physical health, people's lives vs the economy. Truly whether he realizes it or not what Legault has been "balancing" this whole time is how to displease the fewest number of people for the shortest amount of time. **THIS IS WHY WE ARE STILL IN THE SHIT**. For months we've been ping-ponging between his unpopular and popular decisions. "We can have Christmas/We can't have Christmas"; "Close the Schools/Re-open the Schools"; "Open gyms and restaurants/Close gyms and restaurants". It's a cycle of one week we do something out of necessity, then when we finally start to see the positive effects we reverse it for popularity. So what we end up with is a never-ending kick in the pants machine when we could have just got [one good nut shot](https://media1.giphy.com/media/l3vRi0fRZTl1J2SfC/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e477fl62ttd99ei2ismue0ed5g3h9fyks5crgc6nuzi&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g) and got it over with.
&nbsp;
**So where does that bring us today:**
&nbsp;
In terms of new [cases/deaths/hospital occupancy](https://www.inspq.qc.ca/covid-19/donnees/par-region) things in Quebec are going [ok](https://media4.giphy.com/media/ujpPVOlI6OQ7lWiXz4/giphy.gif), but you've got to be kidding yourself if you think that we are more of a few poor policy decisions away from looking just like Ontario. Today Ontario [announced](https://twitter.com/drbarbking/status/1384136625362333704?s=21) that if you have under 70% chance of surviving intubation will be left to die. This was a [direct result](https://twitter.com/DrCarolynSnider/status/1383587381270388742?s=20) of flip-flopping between either [bowing to public opinion](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/19/ontario-covid-vaccines-outbreak-doug-ford-latest) or listening to [health experts](https://www.toronto.ca/news/medical-officer-of-health-letter-need-for-enhanced-public-health-measures/).  I just want to be clear here, covid is not the only reason you will be intubated in a hospital, there are people uninfected by covid who will die because of this, we have already seen it [here and elsewhere](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02497-w). In fact the poor handling of the pandemic and over-loading of public health systems been linked to many more people dying from [other causes](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201117133908.htm). So yes you should be angry at our government. You should be angry that our healthcare system was teetering on the edge before the pandemic. You should be concerned that our rights are being suspended.  You should be worried about leaving enforcement to the SPVM's best "[judgement](https://twitter.com/agnes_reiss/status/1381047070103113729)" since it has [revealed](https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/montreal-evening-shift-workers-slapped-with-curfew-fines-despite-authorization-letters-1.5263664?cache=ipijopopjosws%3FclipId%3D104056) itself to be [laughable](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-police-quebec-curfew-1.5870961).
 Yes in it's current form **the curfew is bullshit**. Withstanding all this I can't for the life of me can't figure out why this is the hill to die on when the cost of hopping on that hill is only going to hurt others and you had so many hills to get on before it. 
&nbsp;
Oh and a biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiig fuck you to anyone reading this who smashed a window last week. If you want to protest and smash things go do it at the government buildings not the small businesses you no balled pieces of shit.

People need to chill, otherwise we'll end up like Ontario. A covid dumpster fire. I didn't vote for the current provincial party, but I'm glad their doing much better than Ford.
Y‚Äôa un p‚Äôtit bout que ces personnes ne comprennent pas je pas.. si les gens respectaient les autres mesures √† la maison (surtout ne pas visiter les amis, familles, etc.) et au travail, ben on n‚Äôen serait pas l√†, √† se faire mettre un couvre-feu √† 20h. Le gouvernement ont mis le couvre-feu parce qu‚Äôils n‚Äôavaient pas d‚Äôautres choix, et la prochaine √©tape serait un reconfinement total, fermeture des commerces, resto, √©coles, garderies, tout, comme au printemps pass√©.. j‚Äôpense pas que ce soit bien mieux qu‚Äôun couvre-feu, et je pense pas qu‚Äôils seraient ben content non plus. 
Le couvre feu est la mesure qui s‚Äôest av√©r√©e la plus efficace pour stabiliser la transmission. Pourquoi? Plus facile √† contr√¥ler probablement, tout le monde chez vous √† 8h ou 9:30, l‚Äôhistoire fini l√†. Alors que les autres mesures reposent sur la bonne foi individuelle et collective, et donc, laiss√© de la place aux gens de ne pas les respecter.

''Hey, man, on va manifester contre les abus des prix des logements √† Montr√©al!!!''  
''Pas le temps, je manifeste d√©j√† contre le couvre-feu!''

''Chacun ses priorit√©s.''
I would arrest them just for their music choice lmao
I agree with most of your message, but I don‚Äôt disparage the population for not all having the same breaking point that led them to taking some sort of stand against it all. Being locked up in small spaces after 8pm (aside from that 9:30 period) for the last three or four months is a legitimate constraint on many people‚Äôs mental health. I wouldn‚Äôt fault people for not ‚Äúdying‚Äù on some other hill previously as these things don‚Äôt need to be mutually exclusive. You can hate the curfew now and have been active in calling for health care reform prior to the curfew for instance.  Aside from that, if this is what it takes to finally have people let the government know they‚Äôre fed up, then fine. 
Secondly, because the curfew, in the opinion of many (including myself) has the potential to create more covid cases for a variety of reasons,  I don‚Äôt see any ethical impediment to protesting it. For people sharing this viewpoint, you‚Äôre lobbying for a policy shift that makes grocery stores less crowded, you‚Äôre encouraging outdoor activity in lieu of indoor activity where cases are way more likely.   If people want to die on that mountain, I salute them whole heartedly.
Thanks for taking the time to write this, I really couldn't have said it better myself. Seriously stuck between a rock (incompetent government) and a hard place (respecting the gravity of the health crisis). Eventually, they need to be held accountable; election day is too far away and the CAQ popularity is astoundingly high.
Thank you so much for this, it captures so much of what I‚Äôm feeling and is hilarious. Especially the ‚Äúill fuck myself in the ass with a pineapple‚Äù part. Hahaha
THANK YOU!
Quand j'y √©tais il y avait quelques centaines, vraiment pas 1000. Mais je suis parti assez t√¥t vers 19 heure.
j'y √©tais, je dirais environ 500 durant la marche (la personne avec qui j'√©tais pensait 600 √† 700), √ßa paraissait moins dans le parc avant que la marche a commenc√©, et √©videmment moins √† la toute fin aussi quand il commen√ßait a y avoir un peu de confrontation.  95%+ masqu√©s (voire m√™me 97-98%+) et pas de niaiseries.
Yes they need to chill. Outside. In parks. With their friends and families, around a picnic or a BBQ. Not inside their apartments when the sun is to be shining past fucking 8pm. That's what people need to do.
No one on Reddit voted for the CAQ.  
They're all too old to use computers.
The 8pm curfew is as useful as the alcohol prohibition of the 1920's
People will find a way around it, and will still do whatever they think is reasonable for them. And for those that are unable or willing to find a way around, it's depressing as shit. No, not sad, depressing as much as people taking their lives over it. And with Legault it's not just the rules themselves, it's how often they change, giving and taking back, moving goalposts, or even adding stupid "masks all the time even if you planned to picnic" to then realize you can't eat with a mask on, so then a few days later they say it's ok if you are eating, or the latest rollback of the curfew to 8pm even when the scientific numbers didn't back this decision (there was no increase in cases to justify it, and the current decrease isn't even because of the change because measures take 14-20 days to make an impact). It's just a royal mess.
Mental health is as important as physical health. We reached a point with my wife where we will just move back to our country because it's impossible to live under this rollercoaster of rules. There's no light at the end of the tunnel here, no end game, just random rules being thrown at the wall to see what sticks.
T'as des preuves? Parce que j'attends encore des preuves que le couvre-feu est un facteur d√©terminant pour la baisse des cas et √ßa fais quatre mois...
Right, but I think this especially hurts the elders and single people over the age of X
It doesnt make sense to them to leave schools/daycares open, while their whole socializing space have been off limits for over a year. also, its a bitch to do your errands (groceries) when you work 7-7pm and have no time to go outside of the weekend
C'est pas mal √ßa.
Autant que ce couvre feu me fait chier, je sais qu'en fait on paie le prix pour tous les ostis de cons qui ne comprennent pas qu'il ne faut pas aller chez la parent√© pour faire des visites dans la maison.
Surtout lorsqu'on a un variant tr√®s infectueux qui se propage. Il vaut mieux pr√©venir que gu√©rir. √Ä date √ßa fait la job.
T'√©tais l√† ou tu parles au travers de ton chapeau? J'y √©tais, y'ont saut√© sur un gars qui a ramass√© une boite que le SPVM avait √©chapp√© par terre. J'ai rien vu comme "neutralisation". Je les ai plus vu darder et picosser le monde pour leur faire perdre les p√©dales, et les gens n'ont pas mordu √† leurs hame√ßons.

Sais tu qu'on peut aller aux deux? D'ailleurs il y a une manifestation le 24 avril √† 13h30 pour la journ√©e des locataires au metro Parc. Il y a aussi une manif pour les droits des travailleuses du sexe le 1er mai, et une marche pour les sans papiers qui arrive de montreal a ottawa dans une couple de mois. Les enjeux sociaux sont multiples et diff√©rents groupes luttent conjointement contre ces diff√©rents enjeux, et le syst√®me qui les relient. Les luttes se rejoignent.
Le couvre-feu est une d√©cision stupide du gouvernement qu'il peut renverser en claquant des doigts s'il ravalait son √©go. Le prix des logements est caus√© par les r√©alit√©s du march√© de l'immobilier et est un probl√®me de longue haleine sur lequel le gouvernement a peu de prise, surtout pas √† court terme.
Malheureusememt, y'a pas grand chose √† faire pour la crise des logements. Le gouvernement peut adopter quelques mesures, mais c'est un syst√®me complexe qui repose beaucoup sur l'√©conomie et donc, sur tous.
Absolutely people can and should change their minds as more information becomes available. It's also completely normal that they change along with their mental state. The reason I'm shitting on people jumping on here is that it smells to me too much of boredom, false outrage and being willfully under-informed mixing with people's exhaustion and mental fatigue.
&nbsp;
I think we both agree on your second point that the nighttime curfew is exacerbating the transmission in certain cases via forcing night-time travel to day-time hours. That any gains made by reducing night-time mobility would be overshadowed by increased day-time travel. [It's not looking like that is true](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.04.21254906v1.full-text). Since the curfew night-time mobility has decreased 31% with only an 8% increase in daytime travel.
This alongside with it being fairly well documented that overall even ["mild lock downs"](https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-how-effective-are-nighttime-curfews/a-57172102), [specifically night-time curfews](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.25.21254330v1.full.pdf) do  at the very least curb second waves and have statistically significant effects led me to change my mind. What's even worse though is that some projections say that these soft lockdowns [may not do enough even with an accelerated vaccine roll out](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.14.21251708v2.full).
&nbsp;
What I'm not certain of is:
1) While mobility is [strongly](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21358-2#Sec7) related to covid spread how much does the 8% increase in daytime mobility offset the 31% reduction in night-time mobility? I'm fucking sure it's not good that we condensed our rush hour during a pandemic. Especially in a city that relies on public transportation.
2) The effect on mental health. The curfew fucking sucks, and it is dragging on because of the government's implementation. Going to work and being mandated to be in your house right after is no way to live and I am certain that we'll be feeling it's effects for a long time. There is no way to mince words here, people will probably die as a result. This is why I am outraged about the curfew, we have a poorly implemented government plan that will negatively impact people and probably lead to deaths. How does this offset whatever gains we are getting from this shitty implementation of a lockdown. Can you even quantify it ethically/morally?
&nbsp;
**So here's why I'm sure as shit not going to physically protest it and don't think other people should:** 
1) It might work. I'm willing to stay in and claw at the walls a bit more so that maybe one more person can make it through.
2) This isn't a malicious plan by Legault to form an insurrection and start a regime dominating us. It's incompetence mixed political scheming. Which is horrible but the former I would be out breaking (government) property, the latter doesn't outweigh my will to try and keep others safe.
3) There are other ways to change this that I am already engaged in. I've written my/our representatives. I've voted in every election that I've been able to. I'm keeping myself up to date with new information as it comes in while doing my best to change my opinions with it. And I'm doing my best to spread that information with other people. 
4) The data just doesn't suggest that even this mild lock-down wont do good. It sure as shit isn't the right plan. It sure as shit will do some harm but everything points to it doing more good than harm.
&nbsp;
Please let me know if you do find anything relevant about transmission rates specifically related to increase in population density caused by curfews I've been looking for a while and haven't found anything.
It's funny I realized the connection with Little Nicky after I wrote that. Must have been planted in my head subconsciously for a long time.
Haha fair. I'm too Anglo to vote for the CAQ.
Comment tu peux contourner un couvre-feu? Tu vas chez tes amis ou ta famille et tu restes √† coucher?
Encore l√†, tu viens briser une autre r√®gle. Les visites √† l'int√©rieur sont interdites.
y'aura pas de fucking preuves avant longtemps, voir jamais. arr√™tez d'en demander. par contre, il y a des tendences observables: l'ontario avait pas de couvre-feu et la marde a pogn√©, alors qu'au qu√©bec on se maintient √† un niveau assez stable depuis franchement longtemps.
It's hard to say as cultures are different from other provinces / states. As well as the baseline level of infected population. There will be studies for years on the various measures taken. 
Just a gut feeling that tells me it's working, due to the low cases and my assumption that making people be home separates them from other people who also have to be home. (On average of course, there are exceptions but that's not what we are talking about).
I know, I was also stuck like this, not being able to run my errands after 8, which is the time I normally do. 
School and daycares are not ¬´ socializing spaces¬†¬ª for kids, it allows parents to go to work, it‚Äôs absolutely essential. 
I understand it sucks having to socialize over a video call, but you can‚Äôt compare your social life to the necessity for the entire society to have schools and daycare open.
On Thursday after work, I open a good bottle of Labatt 50, put some music on and crack open a bag of chips. I reserve a slot at Metro/Maxi/Loblaws/IGA/OrWhatNots for Saturday and I fill my virtual cart.
It's around 3$ for preparation+pickup and 8$ for shipping. I don't get to buy beers at pubs anymore so I really don't mind the extra fees for the time being.
Fuck le SPVM. ACAB

Non
You‚Äôve certainly done your homework. 
I still don‚Äôt think that shaving 1.5 hours off of everyone‚Äôs evening is a high yield covid reduction measure though.  Total curfew aside, that extra hour and a half really made a difference for myself and a lot of people I know.  I don‚Äôt have a back yard, my place is small and my work days are long and often it‚Äôs hard to get in everything while still managing to find some time to get outside.  Furthermore, the mental health impacts for many of us aren‚Äôt just ‚ÄúI feel sad and this is annoying and inconvenient.‚Äù I‚Äôd rather not get into my situation in detail, but I‚Äôve learned first hand over this last year just how bad stress can fuck you up physically, let‚Äôs put it that way.  If you had asked me a few years ago, I‚Äôd never have imagined that some of the things that have happened were possible ‚Äî just through sustained stress. So for me, there absolutely is a line and it has been crossed.  We need to stop COVID, yes, but public health is a holistic concept.  There is much to be attained in COVID reduction by applying the right policies to schools, work places and day cares. Those are high yield reduction targets. When they‚Äôve done that, then they can come and ask me for my right to go outside, but until then I say ‚Äúgo pound sand, Mr. Legault.‚Äù
Exactement, comme les gens ne peuvent plus se voir √† l'ext√©rieur, ils se voient √† l'int√©rieur et plus longtemps (dodo), ce qui est plus propice √† la propagation.
People dont give a single shit about rules tbh. I spoke to an Uber Driver a month ago and he told me he picked up a Sex Worker and she said:
"I make way more money working and paying a fine then sitting at home".
Most of my non-covid-caring buddies are having tons of sleepovers and such. People are fed up and don't care for rules and anyways, the chances of them getting caught sleeping over is very little unless someone reports it, so people don't care and take chances, that's the sad reality of this curfew but again that's a minority.
L'Ontario avait aussi les patios ouverts. Comment tu d√©termines que c'est le manque de couvre-feu qui a caus√© la hausse des cas plut√¥t que le manque d'autres mesures?
C'est √ßa mon point. Le couvre-feu est une mesure extr√™me qui n'est pas support√©e par la science. Les masques le sont. La distanciation l'est. Avant qu'un gouvernement d√©cide de me dire quand j'peux √™tre dehors, j'aimerais un preuve ind√©niable que c'est une mesure √† prendre.
Sinon t'acceptes de te faire passer n'importe quoi en autant que le gouvernment te dit que √ßa marchera.
It sucks that you‚Äôre getting downvoted, because this is an important conversation.
The problem is we can‚Äôt identify the curfew as a determining factor in the decreasing number of cases. For instance, we knew the holiday season would cause a spike, whereas the period after would cause a steady decline.
Curfews are a massive affront to personal freedom. It‚Äôs dangerous to let a government tell you when you can be outside of your home, especially when science doesn‚Äôt back it up (which so far it doesn‚Äôt).
My worry is that this crisis sets a precedent as to what governments will be able to get away with in the future.
It depends cause if keeping schools open makes it so that their will never be an end in sight to extraordinary (lol) measures, then your conclusion isn't so easy to reach. At some point you have to question whether closing everything for a set period of time would have been better than half measures for an indefinite period.
Yea, but dont discard the importance of mental health for some people to socialize - my background was in events / restos, and I couldnt tell you how many people I met along my life that NEEDED these places

I‚Äôve noticed that since Plante took office, the road quality has improved ‚Äî new pavement that‚Äôs been put down stays down, doesn‚Äôt crumble to shit within a year. That little observation indicates to me that the shameless grift and wholesale thievery (and presumably the endemic corruption) within the municipal govt has been stemmed. For that alone they got my vote. Went out of my way to get registered, that lying fat fuck Coderre isn‚Äôt getting back in.

My polling place is further away than the federal election one. I'm not going.
M√™me chose la ici. C'est vraiment path√©tique d'avoir deux candidats aussi mauvais que Plante et Coderre.
Jpeux pas parler de l'administration Plante, mais je peux confirmer la d√©pravation de Coderre et ci (je connais plusieurs personnes qui travaillaient pour la ville de mtl depuis 2000). 
Sous eux, pis Tremblay avant eux, notre argent de contribuable va √† 75% dans les poches d'un cabal de boss de construction et immobilier et non pour des initiatives qui vont am√©liorer la vies des citoyens d'une fa√ßon durable.
Agreed my street got redone also it's great quality.  They are also changing the lead pipes.   As I said before they are also building high quality skateparks.   Love their work!!

Admettons que je vais voter mais que c'est tous des clounes. Puis-je chialer apr√®s? Est-ce que c'est tjrs malhonn√™te?
T'as trois choix:
1) tu votes pas: les anarchistes vont √™tre contents mais si tu fais rien d'autres apr√®s pour faire pression sur notre syst√®me politique √ßa fait fuck all. Les √©lus vont gouverner pareil peu importe si 30% ou 60% des gens sont all√©s voter.
2) tu annules ton vote : comme tu dis, ton vote sera juste discart√© pis √ßa fera fuck all.
3) tu r√©alise que le mieux est parfois l'ennemi du bien : c'est pas vrai que toutes les personnes qui se pr√©sentent sont juste mauvaises, y'a juste aucun  candidat parfait. Perso, je d√©teste les id√©es Coderre et j'aime beaucoup celles de Plante, mais je comprends aussi pourquoi certaines personnes appr√©cient Coderre parce qu'il est pas fondamentalement une personne horrible. Tu peux essayer de trouver les candidats qui sont le plus proche de tes int√©r√™ts en sachant que yaura aucun match parfait. Pis comme te disais un autre redditeux, la prochaine fois implique toi!
Tu votes pour le moins pire quand m√™me. Parce que veut ou veut pas quelqu'un va gagner et si le/la moins pire gagne ben c'est d√©j√† moins pire n'est ce pas? :)
Diminue un peu ton cynisme pi comprends que entre le pire et le moins pire, y a quand m√™me une diff√©rence √† faire. Tu te pr√©senteras la prochaine fois!
√áa vaut la peine de s'informer sur les candidats locaux. C'est pas seulement Plante vs Coderre, il y a des candidats de ville et de district avec des ambitions sp√©cifiques aux arrondissements.
Changement incremental. Quand le moins pire des parties gagne l'autre partie doit s'adapter pour devenir plus moins pire que l'autre.
Aussi si un 3e partie accumule des votes les autres parties devrons voler des id√©e a celui-ci pour avoir une chance.
S'il/elle est sur le bulletin de vote, alors oui, vas-y fort!

Can I ask what race you are? what slurs did he use?
C'est ce qui arrive quand la STM fait des stations des "points de service pour personnes en situation d'itin√©rance" au lieu de donner la priorit√© a la sant√© et a la s√©curit√© des usager.
I‚Äôm really sorry to hear about what happened. That metro exit has always been sketchy, same as it ever was. In fact the area used to be A LOT sketchier (around 15-20 years ago) but some here will wrongly disagree. Cabot Square was wild back in the early 2000s too.
Remember; Montreal used to have sometimes triple the homicide rate in the 90s (depending on the year). It doesn‚Äôt mean any of this is acceptable today though. 
Please report this incident to the police.
Black people seem to hate on Chinese looking Asians lately. No idea why and I just assume they take Covid facebook too serious. Just charge full speed and head butt the stomach‚Ä¶ is what I want to do after being verbally abused by one.
Please file a report with SPVM and maybe even the STM. You should not have experienced this. I know a report might not do anything to you unfortunately but maybe if the trends for this is higher, they can maybe  increase security.
Sorry you went through that
Was he giving black history month panflets, that guy verbally harassed me twice, months apart and not even aware I was the same person, it seems he does it often.
I too saw that guy outside St Mathieu station couple of days back. He was shouting at people passing by. That metro station is always problematic. As someone already suggested, it's better to take the Guy entrance.
Stay safe.
If i ever punch or beat this guy after he touches me, am i still gonna get arrested for it or is self defense?
Man, so many events like this exactly at St Mathieu metro exit. SPVM need to do something about this wtf.
Was he tall and wearing a (usually blue) tracksuit? There‚Äôs someone who frequents the area that might fit the description that once tried to hit me. Glad you‚Äôre okay.
>houting fast foreign words
like french ?
St-Mathieu exit is always...it's just so bad at all hours now. I wish I could walk fast enough in the mornings to justify going to the Guy entrance instead, but I work far away and every minute counts for the commute. (This morning I had to sidestep someone bigger than me who was definitely trying to walk towards me)
Glad to hear you're ok! 
(I...don't remember Guy being this bad except in the last few years. Nights especially...)
I'm an Asian male, too. Unfortunately, the way things are turning these days, we are not very welcome on this continent. You call out racism against the Asian race, people usually brush it off.
I've come to my conclusion that after 12 years of living in the US and Canada, if you're Asian, it is best to live where there are a lot of other Asian people around. That is best for your mental health.
I had a similar situation happen to me at Union Station in Toronto in 2019, after asking this man to leave people alone on the platform he proceeded to spit in my face and call me a bitch.  He ran into the tracks after, and was caught by police within five minutes.  
Ruined my whole day, and also the police wouldn't let me clean the saliva off my glasses for a good ten minutes while questioning me and taking photos.
How I know I'm in the right Country, > there's no tolerance for this sort of thing. Everybody's onboard at putting guys' like him in his place. This is perhaps the best Country in the world in regards to fighting racism. I'm Sorry this happened but the heads-up for that area around Guy (although well intent) is not really necessary. Thanks for sharing.
And black on Asian racist attacks unfortunately don‚Äôt fit the CBC identity politics that are shoved down our throats.
Downvote away though.
I was walking with my buddy and we both like very built guys. He walks towards us and says something and we both look at him and I am like " Fkn idiot you want your ass kicked or what"? 
I just think he is a drunkie and dont think he is trying yo hurt anyone otherwise I dont see why would hr approach two big duds
OP, this is just Montreal. You will run into this type of incident over and over again from time to time. If you want to live in Montreal, I suggest you get used to it. Usually, it's from homeless people and people with mental health difficulties. So I try to understand and brush it off. I know homeless people have it rough and it's something they can't control. I don't get it from your everyday people but sometimes I do. 
When it really hurt was when I was at SAT (venue). I walked up to the bar and there was only one barmaid. People usually don't line up in bars in Montreal and are super aggressive. Basically anyone that is able to get the attention of the bartender first, gets served first. I get that. I'm not an aggressive person, I can't do that shit. So she started serving everybody else and they left. I was left alone at the bar table. I ordered my drink, she pretended like she didn't hear it. I was just standing there for 15 minutes. Finally, my white friend came to check up on me. Only then, she served my drink.
Another time, I was yelled by one guy to "go back to fucking Chinatown" at La Banquise. 
Another time, I was picking up some veggies from a farm-to-table thing and put my English name on the list. I show up there and tell them my English name. They say they don't have ANYONE by that name. They make me wait for 20 minutes. Only after 20 minutes, they go like "Oh you're [insert English name I gave them in the first place]!!!"
These are the most ostentatious act of racism I got in my 7 years in Montreal but there are countless other times that I get dirty looks from people. There is a lot of anti-Asian, anti-Chinese sentiment in this city.
I am 100% positive the reason this person harassed you is because you're Asian. You are a victim of a racist harassment.

L‚Äôabondance de discours discriminatoire envers les personnes ayant des probl√®mes de sant√© mentale et celles en situation d‚Äôitin√©rance ou sinon le discours subtilement teint√© de racisme et de sexisme - on dirait accidentel - dans ce thread me pr√©occupent gravement.

Dr√¥le d'histoire.
For real though at Lionel-groulx and guy Concordia there‚Äôs always something weird going down. The worst I‚Äôve seen was a homeless guy screaming to the top of his lungs that he was gonna kill everyone whilst pissing in the station and invading peoples personal space pants down. Past 10:00pm it‚Äôs always a gamble in those stations.
Does anybody know the reason for why they mainly populate that area? Lots of druggies and mentally ill encounters there.
I know, I really don't like it at night. There are always weirdos and druggies etc. I'm not overly paranoid but it's really sketchy at times.
montreal illness and substance abuse
You aren‚Äôt supposed to get the police involved because they might shoot him.
Rightfully so.
ya I think I saw this guy recently, just randomly pointing at people and yelling random gibberish (not even sure if they're words or just sounds). didn't see him touch anyone but i crossed the street when i got close
>in fast foreign words
aka french !
D'accord, mais au final √ßa va changer quoi si l'homme en question correspond au profil que certains ici ont dress√©, √† savoir un itin√©rant sous l'influence de drogues?
I'm from China and obviously he meant GTFO
Ben si le gouvernement va pas les aider avec les soins mentale, physique et administratif dont ils ont besoin pour √©chapper l'itin√©rance, ils auront besoin de quelqu'endroit o√π ils peuvent dormir et √©viter du mauvais temps. Les missions ont pas assez d'√©space pour tout les sans abri.
stm cops are worse than this guy tho, so that's not an answer
Ce qui me laisse poser une question qui saura susciter une controverse: les notions de racisme ont-elles exclusivement √©t√© enseign√©es aux caucasiens par des caucasiens pour des caucasiens?
Car le racisme inter-ethnique me para√Æt extr√™mement apparent.
It's ridiculous to put all black people in a same bucket because the actions of some people.
The amount of racism in this comment supposedly decrying racism is astounding
you would think that a group of people who are oppressed and going through the same minority status as you are would be nice to each other, right? in my experience, it couldn't be further from the truth. there is no solidarity between marginalized groups. i'm not saying this only about black people here. every ethnic group does this. They only care about how they get treated by white people. Asian people are very racist toward black people as well. I'm not saying every Asian person living in Canada is racist toward black people but most newcomers are likely to be. same thing as black people as well. black people are super racist to Asian people as well. black people went through a lot of shit on this continent and you see a rich Mainland China newcomer who look like they come from money, of course there will be some resentment. they are forgetting that Chinese people also suffered in Canada as indentured laborers. They are forgetting that not everybody who look Chinese are actually Chinese. there are Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and Filipino people who look Chinese but have nothing to do with the Chinese identity.
Idk if you‚Äôre a young kid but this isn‚Äôt news, Chinese and black people have always had hate for one another.
Idk if you‚Äôre a young kid but this isn‚Äôt news, Chinese and black people have always had hate for one another.

Thanks everyone. No filter added to the picture btw

Thats a useless comment. Are you for real? If i liked the picture i liked the picture go mind your own gd business
You must be new around here
That's an angry reply.
there is not "planet B"
You vote with your dollar more than with your vote.
Commen√ßons par nous sortir de ce p√©tro-√©tat afin de poss√©der tous nos pouvoirs et devenir un mod√®le d'√©nergie durable dans le monde!
based on the reports from the anti passport protests looks like theres a couple of hundred people there
I like how they try so much but like it makes no difference if China and India dont get their shit together and right now in those countries you should know that they are too busy trying to get by to give an F about climate issues  
it really comes down to leaders and incentives.   
and there is no planet B 100% , mars will take a long long time for us to really set up.  
its a sad reality but we're headed for ultra chaos
J'aurais aim√© avoir leurs avis sur le rajout des pistes cyclables a Montr√©al...
Des milliers √† *Montr√©al* pour chialer contre le pipeline transmountain 1 semaine apr√®s que tout ce beau monde aie fortement vot√© pour r√©√©lire Trudeau. Ils √©taient ou pendant les √©lections eux...
*l√† o√π la main de l'homme n'a jamais mis le pied*
*yet*
**OPEN YOUR EYES AND SEE!!** ü§ò
But also vote, keeping the planet habitable is not a consumer choice. No matter what the people who invented the "carbon footprint". Plastic straws aren't going to offset the fishing industry's plastic release into the ocean.
Si c'√©tait aussi simple... Kurzgesagt ont fait un vid√©o l√†-dessus : https://youtu.be/yiw6_JakZFc
Si, demain, les politiciens d√©cidaient d'augmenter la taxe carbone pour r√©ellement refl√©ter le coup que son usage a sur l'environnement; si demain ton gas te co√ªtait 3x plus cher, serais-tu satisfait? Je crois que tout le monde s'imagine une transition smooth vers un monde sans p√©tro, mais si on devait vraiment agir, je suis pas mal convaincu qu'il y aurait des mutineries partout dans le pays. 
C'est pareil comme quand on a quitt√© l'Afghanistan, la d√©cision est le bonne sur principe, les co√ªts humains dans l'imm√©diat sont aussi tr√®s couteux, et √† cause du biais de recense, ce sont ces derniers qui preoccuperont tlm. C'est aussi pour √ßa que Trudeau se dit pro-environnement tout en achetant une pipeline, pcq le co√ªt humain dans l'ouest est pe consid√©r√© comme trop grand, sans r√©el plan de transition. Pour nous au Qu√©bec, on peut bien s'en taper puisque √ßa nous touche pas vraiment, pas vrai? J'ai bien h√¢te de voir comment on va s'en sortir sans r√©elle unit√© nationale.
Bin pour √ßa faudrait que la plan√®te arr√™te de consommer du p√©trole, ce qui est bien loin d‚Äôarriver (ex: combien de gens connais-tu ont une voiture √©lectrique) . Si le Canada arr√™te d‚Äôexploiter le p√©trole les autres pays (des dictatures comme l‚ÄôArabie) vont juste plus le faire et avec encore moins de r√®glementations que nous
Durable, mais sans nouveau barrage et sans nucl√©aire bien s√ªr. On va couvrir le Qu√©bec de panneaux solaires et d'√©olienne
Minimum 10 millions.
[The pro of being an authoritarian regime is that you can go a lot harder when making environmentalist policies.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zt-SMlaaM8)
It's sad because ultra chaos can be totally avoided.  But instead of meaningless protests, if people could invest in themselves to become more productive, smarter and efficient, that would be a far more effective approach to tackling the apparent problems they cite.
Qui, dans les participants de la marche (√† part le gros Denis), peut √™tre contre des transports plus sobres?

We're fucking up this one pretty fast compared to how slowly we're terraforming Mars
Kind of building the lifeboats as the ship is sinking
If course there will be for those willing to volunteer as lifelong slaves in mega mines on Mars for Musk&Bezos Private Defence Monopoly.
Je pense que mon message n'√©tait pas assez clair, je m'en excuse : r√©alisons l'ind√©pendance du Qu√©bec pour se sortir du p√©tro-√©tat canadien. Une unit√© nationale au Canada, √ßa a √©t√© d√©montr√© maintes fois que √ßa n'arrivera pas. Dotons-nous des pouvoirs pour r√©aliser ce qu'on veut et ils pourront faire leurs propres choix sans avoir une province qui chiale toujours.
Quand m√™me moins polluant que les sables bitumineux.
Les barrages et le nucl√©aire sont des √©nergies bien plus fiables que les √©oliennes et le solaire qui sont des sources d'√©nergies intermitentes et leurs taux d'√©missions √©chelonn√©s sur la dur√©e de vie compl√®te des installation est √©quivalent voir meilleur a quantit√© d'√©nergie √©gale produite.
Of courses plus authoritarian regime are also genocidal so less people, earth healing. A win win.
yes but good luck getting the authoritarian regimes of those countries to focus on environment issues  
think of it like this --- all the goody environment shit that canada will do will maybe make 0.5% difference AT BEST while the shit that china n india need to do is like 10%
If everyone made little changes the result would be massive. We can't count on govs to make it for us
Honn√™tement, il a partiellement raison. Je connais beaucoup de personnes qui y sont all√© et qui ont √©t√© √† la manif ou publi√© une story parlant d'environnement mais qui habitent en banlieue et ont un mode de vie compl√®tement n√©faste. Le genre de monde qui chiale sur le trafic alors qu'ils sont eux-m√™me dans une auto dans ce trafic.
tu sera surpris du nombre !!
Ceux-l√† ne marchent pas.
Statistiquement improbable, mais quand m√™me, c'√©tait pendant les √©lections qu'il fallait marcher...
C'√©tait a moiti√© a la blague bien sur. Il faut absolument sauver la Terre, son climat et ses √©co-syst√®mes. Cependant, je d√©teste l'attitude de certains √©cologistes qui pr√©tendent qu'il faut cesser tout programme spatial tant que la question √©cologiste sera d'actualit√©. Elle sera *toujours* d'actualit√©, et deux plan√®tes valent mieux qu'une. C'est une fausse dychotomie.
Vrai. Apr√®s, si demain le Qu√©bec et l'Alberta se s√©paraient de la f√©d√©ration et faisaient √† leurs t√™tes, sur le plan net, on serait toujours dans la m√™me situation. Ce n'est pas un argument pour conserver le statut quo; mais √† un certain point il faudra que tout le monde se fasse √† l'id√©e que les changements n√©cessaires seront douloureux pour tous.
Let's not go to eco-fascism.
Personal responsibility is propaganda created by the oil and gas industry to deflect responsibility from them.
71% of green gas emissions are caused by 100 corporations.
We'll never address climate change unless we hold those responsible accountable for their actions, and without intervention at a state level, and for this we must either elect leaders who will do so, or find a way to show our current leaders that the climate crisis will also be disruptive to them.
Not only do we need protests, we need protests and demonstrations that are harder to ignore. General strikes, hunger strikes, lobbying for a carbon tax, etc.
Buy an electric car. Travel less. Eat less meat etc. 
All more effective that heading to a self-destructive protest.
Qui a raison? (qui est il?) 
Oui il y a beaucoup d'hypocrites (comme partout). Mais Coderre n'est pas le dernier √† vouloir tout faire pour avoir plus d'autos mais de se pointer √† une manif pour le climat
J'ai beau essayer, je ne suis pas capable de comprendre comment tu peux arriver √† la conclusion que les manifestants ont vot√©, ou pas vot√©, pour un parti ou un autre, ou que tu puisses les bl√¢mer pour le r√©sultat de lundi. Une logique probablement singuli√®re, si elle en est une.
Imagine rien crisser pour changer quoi que ce soit pi participer par ton inaction √† la fin du monde pi QUAND M√äME chier sur le monde qui essayent de faire de quoi depuis ton ordinateur.
Sauf qu'une deuxi√®me plan√®te habitable est un end-goal dans 10 000 ans. Pas 50.
Mars va encore √©tre l√† dans 10000 ans. Si on est pas capable de garder la terre habitable oublie mars...
Aussi, non, les hey explorateur scientifique martien reviendrons pas sur Terre apr√®s l'apocalypse et autres avoir appris de nos erreur. Juste a regarder qui est dans la Rockette penis.
I agree that the elite have a huge part of the responsibility but at the same time, it is the public that fuel demand for all the consumption that wrecks this planet. How many people do you know who would be willing to go vegan, who would not buy a new phone/graphic cards every 2 year, who would not view cities as cesspools full of annoying and bad people you need to get away from etc...
I feel the same way whenever anyone mentions how we would get no where if we don't get China and India to get their shit together as if we were doing so much better in relative terms. If we were to bring back enough manufacturing to the developed world for us to be self sufficient, we would be polluting almost just as bad per capita.
Problem with the electric car is if you already own something that's paid for you are just putting yourself into debt. Besides right now is a horrible time to purchase a car. But I understand where you are coming from so I didn't mean to come off as rude. Travel less with gas car, plan trips better, stop buying garbage disposal goods that need contant replacement. Walk or ride your bike more.
That is not how it works. But sure.

They're also quite expensive and not many models are as of yet available in Canada.  The supercharger infrastructure isn't largely in place yet either.  And high-passenger capacity elec. cars are rare.
So a more fuel efficient vehicle, etc. will be the go-to for many of us for the time being yes.
However governments will be telling us to buy electric.  There are many electrics on the road already.
As for garbage disposal goods, it seems that various business models rely on that...  [Designed obsolescence.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5v8D-alAKE)  This is something that people can try to overcome through their own purchasing habits, but often it is difficult to do as better products aren't made available locally.
For example, try buying a long-lasting LED light bulb in Canada that's going to last as long as they say it's supposed to.  It's nigh impossible.  While in Dubai it's regulated.  ['The Dubai bulb'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klaJqofCsu4&t=801s) was designed by the same manufacturer, takes way less electricity to operate, and lasts as long as 25 years because it isn't coming with designed obsolescence. 
So yes we can do all sorts of things to personally decrease carbon footprints, etc.  But there are programmed limitations to this that aren't in a consumer's control.
Pretty sure it's better than burning carbon to be pointlessly arrested over and over again. These people need to be more efficient and learn more skills.
Fausse √©quivalence, Mars est un dessert mortel sans atmosph√®re pas une for√™t abondante et fertile.
Straw hats are very comfortable when it's hot and sunny.  When I travel to the Caribbean I often wear a straw Panama hat, small sombrero or my favourite a straw Amish farmer's hat.  
It keeps the sun off your head, face and neck and straw is airy so you don't overheat.

Late spring in the UK is fantastic. You can walk around in shorts or pants and neither shiver nor sweat, the drizzle was like having a constant cooling fan around, and people really underestimate how nice it is to be warm but not sunny or humid. 
I just really hate the sun.
Ajoutes un ventilateur pour faire circuler l‚Äôair. J‚Äôen ai achet√© un √† 20$ et √ßa a fait une m√©chant diff√©rence
If I may, and if you want to... Ditch the grass, get clovers or creeping thyme and plant native, easy to maintain bushes on the edges. Not only you won't be mowing grass, a non native, non helpful and extremely water-needy species, you'd have a bountiful, beautiful and shady yard.
I am no rich woman and I know the startup cost is a lot, but the benefit to your mental health to see all the greenery, and the benefit of maintaining them less than grass + the shade it will bring while reducing the heat + giving you privacy might be worth it.
If you have giant land (like acres), might I suggest looking into mowed path?
Anywho, have a nice day stranger and good luck!

wow thank you! I'll have to check it out! I know there are a lot of nice beaches in Ontario but was hoping to find some in Quebec too. I grew up here but left for a decade and now I'm back with a family (it's been 6 years now) and rediscovering this province!

indeed... Nothing really great.
Quebec doesn't really have any good beaches but it has some pretty beach obsessed residents. Ironically. They probably all dream to move to FL or become snowbirds. It's weird but very Quebecois.
Yeah, the main benefit of Cap-Saint-Jacques is that we can show up around/after 5 (half price entry, but mainly "after work") without having to cross any bridges. It's a pretty easy ~20 min drive from my place.

The last chalet I rented was near Mont-Tremblant, it was very expensive but the view wasn't as nice as this one, only trees and nature.
[deleted]
Thanks so much!
ü§£
What you are doing is still funny tho
Ah sorry It's just the place on the top of Mount Royale you can walk up to called Chalet Mount Royal I think. It's a popular viewing point.
Nice troll
ü§£
Incroyable, je vis √† Montr√©al depuis plusieurs ann√©es et je n'ai jamais vu cette prise de vue! Tu as utilise un chemin secret?
Kondiaronk belvedere I think it's called. Top of those deadly stairs lol
Yeah I was a bit suspicious as it's basically the most popular photo spot in the city but didn't wanna be a dick lol
Why does [deleted] make you laugh so maniacally?
Pas de chemin secret. Prends le chemin vers le Belvedere. C'est pas loin de la Croix.
Sorry brah don't speak the francis... you wanna tell me a secret?
We‚Äôre just used to the bi-weekly pictures of that angle... next week it‚Äôll be the Cohen mural with another story!
Also, we kid with sarcasm... so don‚Äôt worry about it!
Si c'est si populaire, pourquoi personne ne post jamais ce point de vue sur le sub?
Lol well before it was deleted, the person asked if all the windows were tinted black like that. I honestly thought they were kidding haha
√áa doit √™tre un chemin seulement pour les gens qui font de l'escalade, on n'a jamais vu de photo de ce point de vue ici!
Je ne m'appelle pas Francis d√©sol√©!
Maybe it will be in black and white?
Ah yeah no worries, just had a nice day climbing the mountain, enjoyed the day and liked the shot and wanted to share it. 
If people have other places they would suggest to go out to to get a shot of I am ALL ears. Love this city and would love to explore and shoot more.
Oh yeah. That was u/CalmYoTitz. I also responded in the same way to zer other comment above.

The Summit Circle Lookout is worth a visit, similar view but much less busy.
Belv√©d√®re Outremont offers another great lookout. It's relatively quiet, and has cool stuff around.
First picture is awesome, was a nice view for 5-10 minutes and then it vanished!
Le ciel √©tait magnifique ce soir!

> L'Allier said the fire started when a barbecue propane tank exploded on the balcony of a nearby unit
how
Ma hantise d'√™tre r√©veill√© en plein milieu de la nuit et √™tre forc√© de partir de chez moi √† cause d'un incendie et de pas avoir le temps de rien prendre que mes bottes pis mon manteau.
et **tout** perdre.
Something similar happened in PAT last summer.  An exploding propane tank resulted in a huge condo fire.  Kinda scary.
I feel bad, but.....her friend starting a gofundme for $100 000 is pretty obnoxious to me.  Home insurance is there for a reason and any sane person should have 'replacement value' in theirs. I get she's an olympian, but I hope the gofundme is a bust. If you can't be generous to a local charity, why donate to somebody who already has an earning capacity higher than most people? The public has already financed her athletic endeavours, why would people willingly finance her lifestyle? And her husband is a pro football player.
[deleted]
We need to get Hank Hill on the case. 
Meaghan is awesome and hope she can somehow get her medals replaced and I am happy she‚Äôs alright.
I've met a few olympians through my line of work and most keep them in bank boxes. Looks like it's a good idea.
Faulty/tempered with tank, use with improper accessory, improper seals, leaking lines, improper storage, operator error and that's just off the top of my head. I'm sure there are dozens more ways
Sometimes the line between the tank and the barbecue can rupture which causes a gas leak which can explode if the barbecue is on at the time.
It's also possible that the fire started on the balcony for another reason and only got really intense once the propane tank got involved.
Source : I am a fire investigator
Edit: I just looked at some pictures of the site of the fire and the building is completely demolished. No fire investigator would be able to objectively determine the cause of the fire in those circumstances, so witness testimony would be the only evidence available. It would all depend on who saw the fire first / where it was / what did the occupants do in the hours before the fire. Did they use the barbecue? Did they smoke a cigarette on the balcony? Was there an exterior outlet with something plugged in? Did the fire start inside the condo and then propagate to the balcony? Etc
Peut √™tre en r√©chauffant la bonbonne sur le bbq charcoal
You‚Äôd be amazed the amount of poorly maintained tanks that rust and leak. It‚Äôs called a BLEVE, it happens more than you think.
Having seen some similar stuff, some people who don't take care of their bbqs at all let the grease in them accumulate until it overflows and drips down to the tank/hose, and sometimes catches fire as well.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyihRcL_Q9M 
See for yourself, while i have no ideas how it initially started, the fire did start from a BBQ propane tank and moved on to another 
Explosion at 13:12
Luckily the firefighters managed to put it out and from what i can see from my place, only the two affected units remain empty
Sounds unlikely...it is hard to blow up a tank according to myth busters.
Astuce : j'ai pr√©par√© un petit endroit facile d'acc√®s avec mes documents importants (papiers, visa, sant√©, banque, etc...) , un peu de cash, un disque dur qui backup mes ordis, un vieil ordi portable, un vieux t√©l√©phone intelligent et ma gameboy sp.
Une am√©lioration serait d'avoir un sac avec un minimum de r√©sistance au feu histoire que si je le perde pendant l'√©vacuation... Mais je ne sais pas quoi prendre pour le moment.
50/50 chance. Either it happens or it doesn't. :)
Even melted down, it's apparently 6oz of gold and the rest silver.  Maybe someone will find it
Only problem I have with that is if it was any of that... the article would be about how a person blew themselves to oblivion and _then_ the entire building... not burned medals and mental health... so what happened for a tank to just blow up on its own
[deleted]
Cool Job! (Right?)
Moi dans ma petite valise j‚Äôai juste mit mon gameboy sp et la ptite lumi√®re avec Pok√©mon
Il me semble qu‚Äôil existe des coffre forts anti-feux
It wouldn't blow up on its own, someone would have had to use the barbecue at the time or earlier in the day.
It wouldn't be random. Poorly secured tank or leaky line, or just leaving it on by mistake and something getting too hot over time near the gas line.
Not really. Propane tanks are quite resilient and it's safer to store it outside so firefighters can easily remove it or spray water on it to prevent it from exploding during a fire.
Propane tanks are used a lot for heating on industrial sites during the winter so there's no problem with tanks getting cold.
Maybe just cover it with a tarp during the winter to prevent ice buildup around the valve, and make sure to give your valve and barbecue line a good visual inspection at the start of barbecue season. Look for cracks or deformation.
Ils prot√®gent juste le papier, bien souvent. La temp√©rature va quand m√™me monter √† l'int√©rieur et le plastique va fondre.
Pourquoi pas faire le feu dans le coffre-forr alors et prot√©ger tout le reste?
well that's reassuring
Who is using a barbecue in the dead of winter? It's literally -15¬∞C outside, use your oven like everyone else.
Canadians.
I am...Some foods just taste better on the bbq! The cold cannot stop me from tasty food.
Lots do
It‚Äôs warm by the bbq, so you don‚Äôt feel it. Better tasting.
I am bbq-ing tonight lol ...and you call yourself a montrealer üôÑüòÜ
I'll BBQ to about -5c.  Ain't frying no steaks.
Why wouldn't you?
As a matter of fact, we seldom do, but do it nonetheless.
Oh I know, I'm Canadian. And snow has never stopped me from using a BBQ haha
What has made this winter so pleasant is the lack of freeze thaw cycles.  We haven't had to deal with much slush or ice because there haven't been many partial melts.
42cm of snow? Where?
Y'a pas eu de gros redoux depuis les premi√®re neiges.  
√áa parait, en tout cas, √ßa parait sur ma terrasse qui est √† l'ombre .
J'ai tellement envie de faire du snow mais mes proches sont a risque... fait que profitez-en pour moi. Les conditions ont d'lair detre ecoeurantes.
Does anyone else wish they wouldn't remove the snow? I mean of course it makes practical sense, but the child in me feels like I'm missing out on the experience of a record snow day because it all gets hauled away and when I look out my window it looks just like any other winter day.
[The photos of the city pre-snow removal look incredible.](https://tce-live2.s3.amazonaws.com/media/media/b7d2780c-b2f2-4c1e-9609-7e2b5864b9d2.jpg)
We've had a really mild winter so far
Yesterday was my first time in Montreal in the winter. I am from Brazil (a place without snow), and I was thinking today "Jesus, it is always like that?".
I think 2008 was when we had a huge snowstorm during march break. Made for a good week for my lazy cegep self who stayed inside playing videogames all week. I feel like we don't have THAT much snow outside but maybe it's because I've only had to shovel out my car like.... once so far, and it wasn't even a two-timer with the shovel (as in, shovel, get in car, try to move, still stuck, had to get out and shovel again) just shoveled once and vroomed right out of there.
I remember that winter. Shoveling was no fun
If there‚Äôs something I‚Äôve learned since moving to Montreal is that every year there‚Äôs a new record of something üòÇ
We haven't had a lot of HUGE snowstorms...that Xmas rain would have been snow but it was too warm. We also haven't had deep-freezes with -30 temps and so far, no freezing rain or ice storms.
But let's not jinx the no-hitter!
However, the ski/snow conditions must be fantastic.
C'est tu juste moi ou est-ce que je trouve √ßa ben normal comme quantit√© de neige?
C'est triste un peu quand m√™me. Je me souviens des hivers avant √ßa o√π il y avait ben, ben plus de neige que √ßa.
I'm curious where you took this data from.
Mmmm... √ßa sonne les inondations au printemps √ßa :(
Our snow-on-the-ground chart for this year looks like the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Makes me feel proud.
Oh shit I misread that, I thought we were having 42cm of snow TODAY and I was like... shit how did I miss this, did I really not look out of the window for that long??
has it really been that snowy of a winter? It doesn't feel like it to me. *shrug*
We're up in the Laurentians and it is less than it was a couple of years ago. We don't get the thaws you get in Montreal though.
I want to see how deep the pot holes will be and how long the useless Mrs Weed, our Mayor will take to patch them. If her BS was asphalt it wouldn't take long....
[deleted]
Now we will see if we will pay the price with flooding in the spring.
Hopefully it won't all melt at once.
so true. Last year was such a freaking mess. The puddles were huge and our neighbour had flooding, when melted snow cascaded down their driveway.
Noticed it snowboarding, last year it was full of ice everywhere. This year the season started late, but the snow has been amazing so far!
Unless you own a roof.  A lot of people will be in for a bad surprise when the 1st big thaw comes.
That‚Äôs fair but I feel like there‚Äôs too much snow around my property. I feel it needs a melt and like other comment, hopefully not all at once
Outside, the place no one goes anymore.
:-D
I'm in MHM (more precisely in Longue Pointe)... and I can say there's at least 40cm of accumulated snow on my front yard, backyard and root of my garden shed.
At the airport.
Must've been measured at 12:01 AM, because today is warm and everything is melting. There was more snow yesterday.
My balcony has at least that much, and it‚Äôs south-facing
Ouf je veux pas √™tre plate... mais tu as absolument z√©ro chance d'√™tre a risque a faire du snowboard.  Bonus de vitamine-D en plus.  Profite-en car sinon tu auras perdu 1 ann√©e de ski pour rien.
Au pire loue-toi un √©quipement de split-snow, monte par toi-m√™me seul et descend les pistes!!
Y‚Äôa pas bcp d‚Äôactivit√©s moins √† risque que le snow honn√™tement. C‚Äôest moins pire que marcher dans la rue, tu montes uniquement avec des gens de ta bulle, donc si tu y vas seul t‚Äôas une chaise √† toi. Et dans les lignes en bas tout le monde est √† plus de deux m√®tres, √† l‚Äôext√©rieur, avec un masque.
It sounds fun, but it poses a series of serious consequences.
I come from the Maritimes where a lot if cities don't have the budget to haul away much snow.  The problem is that snow banks end up so big that you have to design your streets differently (the sidewalks are further from the street to allow space for snow to pile up between them).
Note the shmoes manually removing snow in your photo :)
I‚Äôd love if we left the snow around, people would be cross-country skiing to the store and having loud-ass snowmobile accidents
Hahah good luck
It is normal to have SOME snow on the ground at this time of the year, but this is more than typical.
I still remember that year because my front door‚Äôs lock broke and I couldn‚Äôt open the door. I had to get out by the back door and walk in at least 3-4 feet of snow. I remember walking to the metro station and the snow was high enough to almost cover the city‚Äôs garbage bins. It was something else!

On a eu un automne chaud, donc le sol √©tait pas gel√© aussi longtemps qu'en 2019. Aussi, √ßa va vraiment d√©pendre du printemps.
√áa d√©pend de la vitesse que √ßa fond.
si √ßa fond tranquillement pas vite, √ßa va aller, mais si on a une grosse semaine de gros temps chaud √ßa va fondre plus vite que les rivi√®res peuvent le supporter.
Oddly, no.  But we haven't had a thaw so the snow just keeps piling up.
Depends on rain and all kinds of other factors. A week of 5¬∞C will take a lot of the sting out, but even with much less snow hard rain could cause flooding.
Took up skiing this year. It‚Äôs been phenomenal.
I have a steep roof.
Same here
Wow, really? Can you link to whatever topographical snowfall map you've got? Sounds cool. What's the snowiest habitable Montr√©al neighborhood?
It was measured at 7am, at the airport.
Oui, mais je ne peux vraiment pas prendre de risque. Pas pour moi mais pour ma famille plutot. Je peux me passer d'un hiver de snow si ca veut dire que tout le monde demeure en santee.
Ce qui est archi platte p.c.q. les conditions sont ecoeurantes cette annee.
\+ emergency vehicules still need to move around. Covid or not.
Metro to Mt-Royal, then slide to work.
Slide to Square-Victoria and metro home at the end.
Until hes in front of you on a hill.
Ah yes that guy. You can usually see him walking around with a big board that says "look at me".
Pardon me sir, but could you spare a tuppance for a pint of Guiness?
It's called a penny-farthing! They're actually super difficult to ride. I tried once in a museum.
Cringe. Anyone riding something like that went out of their way. They didn't do it because it's a better option, they did it because they want attention.
Ahhhh..a lachine canal hipster, spotted in the wild...St-Henri which used to be cheap, dirty, ghetto fabulous... is now gentrified hipster hell, back-to-back $12 taco shops Even if I wanted to, I couldn't afford to move back there, rents have more than doubled.
Where's the old timey moustache and the bow tie

Typical Montreal eccentric looking for attention.
Bof
Until he falls and creates an accident. And no helmet perched that high, what a dumbass. He's no better than the roadies that go full gas on that section of the canal.
Going up.
I‚Äôm still trying to figure out how he gets on that thing
To be fair, this photo was taken in Pointe-Saint-Charles. 
As far as 12$ tacos, I don‚Äôt know of many around St Henri, but for a small fortune you can get a bucket of fried chicken!
Nonsense! They gave it a coat of paint and swept the streets. 
12$ taco shops almost had me in tears lol. I feel that many of those types try way too hard to out style or out hipster eachother. At least he's over to the side vs riding in the middle so +1
Il ne fallait pas exposer Montr√©al comme √©tant une ville pas trop ch√®re, √ßa a attir√© les ontariens ici!

I'll admit I was that person before but then I realised I'm in my mid 30s and likely won't be getting a call from a pro team , if I crash bones suck to heal but most importantly I don't want to injure a kid. I take my chances on St Patrick or ride that section of canal early in the day. Before 10am...
I think he starts out kind of like doing a wheelie and then hoists himself up... but not sure!
Yes, technically this is in the Pointe, but not really,  it's near Atwater market on the St. Patrick side.
LOL! Trendy Fried Chicken
Nothing wrong with pushing sometimes. That‚Äôs what the street is for. That section of the canal is full of kids, pedestrians, leisure cyclists. We all have to cohabitate.
Haha yah for sure, either way I love the canal for a nice afternoon run, hipsters or not!
I feel that the $1.25 steamee choux-moutarde rotteux hotdog is an endangered species in 
St -Henri.
Agreed 100% now I just chill along that section when it's busy. I've changed my ways
Greenspot will always have your back! I believe a bellepro just opened near the IGA too. Booming
I work in a bar and honestly wtf is the difference selling alcohol till 1 or until 3 other than our sales?
Can I stop wearing a mask in a 45 degree kitchen yet?
These capacity restrictions are completely pointless at this point frankly.
Only to have everything revoked third week of September lol
vaccine passport when

You know society is messed up when alcohol is so important lol

still not a peep about martial arts; fucking shame considering a Montreal woman just took a bronze medal in judo at the olympics.
I'm guessing we'll finally know we're out of the woods when the mask mandate is lifted. As a sweaty fat man that's my Valhalla. Until then, keep safe everyone!
Poker is coming back wahooo
Assuming this goes into effect at midnight: does that mean bars will be serving until 1am Sunday "morning"?
People infected with Delta apparently shed 1260 TIMES the virus as compared to Alpha. That‚Äôs a multiple factor as compared to Alpha, not a percentage increase.
Do I still need to wear a mask?
People get drunker as the night goes on, more closes contacts, etc..
What about having to wear a mask when standing up and walking but not while sitting. Makes less sense than a monkey's ass.
Useless as you say. Was with a friend that was ordering so much at 00 to keep going for as long as he can. Even i was drinking maybe the same amount by reaching 3, now I have to drink that amount before midnight!
I agree completely. This is a dumb rule made by some old ass disconnected person that doesn‚Äôt realize that people will simply accelerate their drinking as it moves closer to closing time, whenever that is.
Prohibition era leftovers, 100%. Gotta control that alcohol.
It could be to avoid everyone going out to a bar to celebrate laxed restrictions
virtue signaling
Sitting on a crowded bus sweating my actual face off as I type this. The day the mask mandate is lifted is the day I rejoice. I can't even begin to imagine what retail workers and kitchen staff go through.
Or when doing sports indoors in a giant room full of young vaccinated people? Can we...? This shit is dragging on forever summer is halfway done already...
Masks are the easiest lowest cheapest effort to mitigate propagation.
Different situation, but California has reinstated mask mandates. It's not going away for a while.
I already stopped. I try, but it‚Äôs just too hot.
That was my thought as well.  I assume the size restrictions were related to the ability to contact trace.
Then again our 7-day average is 59 case/day so maybe they can warrant that since our capabilities are so high from the April wave.  Also our vaccination rate is good and still improving.  Maybe it is time to show people the reward of doing the right thing as long as we keep vigilant and are ok with returning to more restrictions if things see an uptick.
EDIT:  7 day average of 59 cases/day was from google and seems to be incorrect.  From [https://www.msss.gouv.qc.ca/ministere/salle-de-presse/communiques/?idcat=3](https://www.msss.gouv.qc.ca/ministere/salle-de-presse/communiques/?idcat=3) it seems like on July 3rd the cases are 101, 99, 103, 76, 61  (two day gap), 83 which means roughly a 7 day average of 87 cases per day.
It‚Äôs damage limitation in case there is a super spreader event. In Europe you‚Äôre seeing  clubs/bars where 50 cases can be traced back to one night of partying.
Yeah, I can't imagine that it makes any difference once you're at 500 people.
Why? You don‚Äôt think the vaccines work?
They did this in France and antivaxs are mad as hell lmao! They can't eat in a restaurant without a recent Covid check, how sad /s
Went to a gym yesterday and I really wish it was a "vaccinated only" place. Between the indoors, exertion and bro-culture it leaves me uncomfortable.

Pretty much all martial arts training centers are open, and have been since July 1st (green zone).

Forever. The Quebec gov loves them like babies love their diapers.
Fair point, however, from what i can see at work is that people just start pounding shots earlier than before. I dont think the hour we close bars has much of an effect on consumer consumption.
Furthermore, I also worked in European bars that only closed after the last clients left and I‚Äôve noticed that customers here tend to binge drink more ‚Äúbecause theres only X amount of time left‚Äù.
Im no law maker, my work experience isnt any per reviewed research as well so IDK...
Idk, in my place of work i can clearly see the reason. There‚Äôs alot of room between the clients and inter-table mingling is limited by this measure i find.
Transmission was predominantly through aerosols, which would circulate indoors. All of the mask on and off stuff is really nonsense unless the business has really good air circulation and probably an air filtration system, which most don‚Äôt. A lot of these rules are pure virtue theater at this point. They should lift them for fully vaccinated people.
I finally started going back to the gym and it‚Äôs frankly gross seeing people touching their masks every two minutes to take them off/put them back on, then touch/handle equipment, then put their mask right back on. I see people get to a machine and take off their mask and put it down on the machine or in a cup holder then back on their face once their done. Yucky. I had pockets the first time I went so kept my mask there but yesterday didn‚Äôt have anywhere to stow it so I just kept it on the whole time. Turned my weight lifting sesh into some cardio.
You‚Äôre proving my point bud
Lol which virtue? Selling booze?
Holy fuck I'm on the other end of the spectrum. I am anything but a germaphobe, but I'm considering wearing a mask on the metro and bus forever.
Imagine ce que c'√©tait dans une classe pas de clim par une chaleur de 30¬∞C +, pendant 7h de temps (le masque √©tait obligatoire dehors √©galement)
The fact that they haven‚Äôt lifted mask mandates for fully vaccinated people has made me lose all faith in this government. Honestly, this is total nonsense. The people wearing masks 8+ hours a day in this ridiculous heat is just unnecessary torture that drives some imaginary virtue signaling bullshit that some Canadians seem to thrive on. 
Anyway, I couldn‚Äôt agree more with you. We are all vaccinated, at least with one shot. In a few weeks we will be near 75% with two shots. It‚Äôs time to fucking move on. The only thing that is killing our summer is this ridiculous government.
Naturellement le gars est introuvable.
Prison.
This is so incredibly sad. Imagine working hard your whole life, making sacrifices, and then your money just disappears and it's not coming back.
Prison pour le fraudeur immobilier et l'architecte pour le Mcmansion
Number one rule when dealing with contractors. Never pay upfront. If they do not have the money to start a job, then they are not trustworthy. You are not to act like their bank. You pay as the job goes on and you are satisfied with the amount of work they have done compared to the money they are asking.
TiL some people dream is to have a house in Laval.
I hear of so many people who have been conned out of their business/life savings. It seems to be a real thing here in Quebec, so many predatory amoral people committing fraud and larceny- with few consequences.
If someone has the money to put a down payment on a house, they are going to do it. The shitty thing about it is these people are nervously trying to find a place as quick as possible for the amount they can afford before it gets bought by a huge corporation. I personally can't imagine owning a home because it would cost too much but these people have every right to save up and purchase a home, but we need to make it easier, affordable, and unreachable by major corporations or wannabe slum lords.
There should be a rule to ensure that the home owners are protected in the same way that the banks and large businesses are protected when they go under.
I just put a down payment for a newly built house from another builder and the agent from the builder did a CGR acompte paper that say I have give a cheque for X amount. If your under the 50 000$ your okay. This is for the first deposit.
Second deposit is to be given at the notary. So nothing stop anyone from putting more, you just need to know what the max that your cover. A good agent will tell you that amount.

Fuck.
Is it really not coming back? Isn't there a way to fix this? It's scary to lose that much money
I'm not so sure that people that young who have $250k in the bank "worked hard their whole life and made sacrifices".
It's not crazy money, but it's definitely not working-man's money.
Many of us don't need to imagine. Similar situation happening to me.

Exactement. Ta mise de fond tu la fais avec la banque pour ton hypoth√®que. That's it.
I know you're getting a lot of upvotes but your comment doesn't apply to the situation.  This was a land developer taking deposits.  No deposit, no home.

As much as I love Laval bashing, Montreal isn't really a good option for people who want families of more than one kid, so yes some people might dream of having a house in the suburbs and a fairly well sized yard.

Probablement avec une lampe de poche et une carabine? Quelqu'un √† qui on doit de l'argent risque de tout faire pour nous retrouver. √Ä la gang ils devraient y arriver!
There's not much they can do. Literally all the guy has to do is ensure his company is insolvable and he won't have to pay a dime even if he's found and tried. Before they can go after the administrators of the company he has plenty of time to get out.
Par pure curiosit√©, pourquoi as-tu cette impression?
The article mentions the downpayments were 150k, 200k. Then it says:
> There is a glimmer of hope, however, as in Quebec, new homeowners are protected by what is called the homebuilders' construction warranty monitored by an industry oversight group. However, it only pays back up to $50,000.
gotta be a way.
>that young
Quel √¢ge avaient-ils exactement? L'article ne le mentionne pas.
Et qu'est-ce que √ßa peut faire? Quelqu'un a travaill√© pour cette somme d'argent. Et aujourd'hui c'est presque impossible pour un jeune couple d'acheter une propri√©t√© sans l'aide des parents.
They're in their mid to late 30s. How is it not working-man (or woman's) money? For a couple, that's 100-125K each over a 15+ year career, that's not crazy. 
That can be just earning a good salary and investing it for a few years, or it could be making money off previous homes, or it could be living at home until buying a first home and never having spent money on rent, or it could be just being very frugal the entire time. You never know how or why someone has the money they do, everyone has different priorities, needs, and goals.
Multi-generational wealth. She could be speaking on behalf of her whole family, and taking charge of the project. It doesn't have to be HER home.
Especially cash! Lots of people in their 30s who will have that equity built up in their property, but as a cash downpayment that's crazy.
Crazy in multiple ways though, because that's barely 20% of many homes nowadays.
It's not that much. They could be 40-45. That's a 15-20 year working career where they saved 10-20k a year. Or it could be equity on an existing house that they own and have paid a lot into. You'd be surprised what you can save when you cut the fat and how much that grows over time.
Not fair to judge
I have close to that and I'm early 30s, husband late 30s, and we did indeed work very very hard and made a lot of risks and sacrifices. My family helped me out with rent until I finished university. That's certainly privilege but I still did a lot of work, I just didn't have to worry about paying rent or food while studying. My husband on the other hand had none of that, only work.
What are you talking about? What makes you think they're rich?
What a shitty thing to say.  Define rich?  I don't think many, if any, of these people were millionaires.  They lost their life savings.  Some have contemplated suicide.
This guy fucked off with $17M of theire money and your opinion is "fuck em, they're rich".  Wow.
Je te p'accorde, ces maisons modenres ont un style beaucoup plus uniforme
√áa reste lette comme le criss
That was hard to watch, incredibly pretentious.
What's worse is it seems he wasn't posing. He has built a lot of homes before. So if you did a normal amount of due diligence, it could seem like he was credible based on his track record. As the one person said, they even went and visited prior homes to see if they were happy with the actual quality. 
So horrible.
Putting that much money as deposit isn‚Äôt normal.   Normal is 15, 20000.   Or up to the guaranteed 50,000.  Not more.  
This guy told buyers that for every 100,000$ they‚Äôd put as a deposit he‚Äôd knock off 10,000 on the price of the house.  That‚Äôs one of the reasons people out so much.
So, you are telling me that there is a chance?
Il y a certainement des gens qui paient 500$ pour leur loyer a Montreal, mais ces logements ne sont pas disponibles.
C'est clair que le salaire n'a pas augmenter autant que le prix des loyers.
Quand tu as une maison de $5 millions
[https://www.noovomoi.ca/en-vedette/francois-legault-vend-sa-somptueuse-demeure-victorienne-d-outremont-pour-5-millions.html](https://www.noovomoi.ca/en-vedette/francois-legault-vend-sa-somptueuse-demeure-victorienne-d-outremont-pour-5-millions.html)
I seriously doubt Legault has ever rented an apartment in his life. If he ever did, it hasn't been in the last 3 decades. He may have grown up in a humble family but the dude has become and elitist twat. His exemption of the homeless during the curfew was closer to enmity than just lack of empathy.
I know Montreal faces many challenges, but in my opinion high land prices are how it dies. It strangles innovation, small businesses and communities.
Where are our elected officials? This situation serves a minority of people who do not create the value that generates their high rents.
Ce que les gens oublient aussi c'est que dans sa question originale, Manon Mass√© demandait le co√ªt **m√©dian**. J'en trouve beaucoup qui d√©fendent Legault en disant qu'il a techniquement raison parce qu'un logement a √©t√© trouv√© √† 500$; c'est simplement faux. Il n'a pas techniquement raison dans sa r√©ponse. Une m√©diane, c'est un seul chiffre, ce n'est pas un intervalle.
Vous pouvez trouver √ßa p√©dant, mais je trouve √ßa r√©v√©lateur. √áa indique qu'il √©tait absolument incapable de dire un seul chiffre qui a de l'allure, donc il a sorti un intervalle de chiffre tout simplement √©norme et absurde. Pour donner un exemple similaire, c'est un peu comme s'il disait que le salaire m√©dian c'est "√ßa commence √† 25 000$ et √ßa monte vite jusqu'√† 80 000". Si quelqu'un est PM et qu'il nie qu'il y a pr√©sentement une crise du logement, on est en droit de s'attendre qu'il ait des informations pr√©cises et √† jour sur le sujet pour faire une telle affirmation.
Moi j'en conclus qu'il ne conna√Æt soit pas le dossier et est d√©connect√©, soit n'a pas de comp√©tences en math√©matiques suffisante pour savoir ce qu'est une m√©diane, ce qui est peut-√™tre pire.
Rendu l√†, j'aurais au moins trouv√© √ßa dr√¥le s'il avait dit : "entre z√©ro et infini" ou bien "c'est un nombre r√©el".
Presque 600$ pour une place tellement petite que tu peut m√™me pas avoir de four. A quand les buildings style dorms avec cuisine et toilette partager?
Oh, is that Harry Potter‚Äôs under-the-stairs cubbyhole?
It makes me sad.  I rented a studio for $550, not that many years ago.  It was a but pricey for my student budget but worth it for me at the time.   I really feel for students and low-income folks. 
This is why it is a good idea to transfer your lease rather than giving it up; it is perfectly legal but prevents landlord from jacking up the rent
Haha, that made me remember the banana cost meme. How much can it be????? These people are out of touch with reality, and they are the one making decisions for us...
De disponible, pas dans la totalit√© des baux actifs.
Denying systemic racism. Denying the fucked up rent issue. There may be a pattern there when it comes to things he doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about fixing.
J'ai subi une belle reno-viction l'an pass√© :) je payais 650 pour un 3 1/2.
Le prix affich√© est maintenant 1100$.
Les r√©nos? Peinture, sablage de planchers et changer la vanit√© dans la salle de bain.
Le march√© est triste.
Suis-je le seul √† croire que cette affirmation de Legault ne soit pas une simple erreur, mais un calcul politique? Du genre qui sert √† bien d√©montrer √† la population rurale et r√©gional que non seulement il est d√©connect√© de la r√©alit√© des m√©chants Montr√©alais, mais qu'en plus, il s'en fout compl√®tement. Le m√©pris des grands centres semble √™tre la norme pour les gouvernement populiste √† travers le monde et l'histoire...
I helped a guy get on his feet about 10 years ago. He stayed rent free with me for 4 years. 
Last time I spoke to him, he was telling me how he's putting his old tenants put using loopholes. Some are old and have been living at that place forever. 
Money changes people. It's one of those life is testing you moments. We might hate who we become when we make it.

I rented an apartment in ndg in 2009, √† large 4.5 with fridge and stove, second floor with two balcony. 550 was my rent. that same apartment is now going for over 1100.
Bon sa lair je loue pas asser chere mon 3 1/2 lol
Non, selon notre PM il co√ªte 250$.
>oui, il y a des loyers √† 600, √† 1000¬†$, surtout quand on est deux pour  partager un loyer¬†¬ª, a affirm√© mercredi le premier ministre. (sur lapresse aujourd'hui)
Les loyers sont aussi √©lev√©s parce que la ville surtaxe pour payer une arm√©e de fonctionnaires 20-30% trop nombreuse gagnant 40% de plus que le citoyen moyen de la ville...
Selon nos premiers ministres √ßa ne coute rien vivre au Qu√©bec! 500$ par mois pour un logement et 75$ par semaine pour nourrir une famille!
*Laughs in Torontonian and Vacouverite*
My guess is that the price will crumble themselves as the people who can afford those prices are now allowed to work full time at home.
Currently waiting for the bubble to pop to buy something nice very far from Montreal: I will never need to work in an office again anyway.
j'payais 625$  pour un 2 1/2 crott√© dans un sous-sol il y a 9 ans.. j'imagine pas c'est rendu combien ces temps-ci 
C'est clair qu'en collocation avec des amis tu peux arriver a trouver de quoi d'abordable 400-500/ch ou autour de 600$ chaque tout inclus. Mais faut chercher, √™tre un peu chanceux et avoir bon cr√©dit sinon t'es fucked

chipping in as a landlord of a few units, all costs went up, insurance though i have never made a claim, continues to go up like 5 to 15% a year, taxes which the city promised would not increase did increase as well, mine went up 150$.
then theirs the cost of labor, ex repaint and fix up a apartment, getting a 4.5 painted a few years ago was like 800$, this year 2200$ yes for a guy to come in spray white paint everywhere for 2 days and leave.
I also had to fix all the damage the old tenants caused, since theirs no security deposit it was all out of pocket for about 9k. So ya theirs not more cheap apartments because everything went up.
Unlike many landlords i followed the rules i increased by 3% for the next tenant, or 20$/ so... now the math (not including all the other increases) i paid 11.2k to fix this place up to make 240$ more a year that is taxed. So its going to take me over 4 years to recupe this cost and in that time %100 there will be more expense, after 4 years of being a landlord i have not profited yet, theirs always more to fix.
Yes i get to discount these expense, but its on money i had to spend in the first place, that was already taxed, that i will again pay tax on.
So when someone increase by a lot more so they can actually cover their costs, its because everything went up and everybody is just being over taxed and costs go up faster than pay.
oh then theirs the argument your building is gaining value, yes it is but that's part of the trap right, capital gain are 50% so that government that's taxing me already on everything will get half my "profit" after sale. 
Sometimes I question if buying in low appreciation areas is better, yes the building doesn't gain as much value yet its less capital gain to pay at sale.
Ben du monde en parle de √ßa mais je vois pas ce que le gouvernement pourrait faire de concret honn√™tement. 
L'alarme comme quoi le march√© immobilier est rendu fou au Canada a √©t√© sonn√© il y a de √ßa quand m√™me longtemps lorsqu'on voyait les prix √† Vancouver monter en fl√®che. Puis suivi Toronto vu qu'il n'y a pas eu d'action concr√®te vraiment non plus. 
Le f√©d√©ral a pratiquement rien fait de concret ne serais-ce que mettre une taxe de plus, typique d'un gouvernement qui voit un probl√®me comme une fa√ßon de faire des sous. √áa a pas stopp√© le courant.
√Ä Montr√©al c'est plus lent, surtout √† cause du fait fran√ßais, mais √ßa rattrape assez rapidement quand m√™me. Val√©rie Plante n'a rien fait non plus aux derni√®res nouvelles; ses annonces sont largement sur des logements sociaux que la majorit√© des gens qui travaillent/oeuvrent √† Montr√©al sont inadmissible.
Maintenant on s'√©tonne que Legault n'ag√Æt pas, mais je vois pas comment ce serait √† lui de faire quelque chose; ma compr√©hension du probl√®me c'est que la pression sur le march√© immobilier provient de l'international qui ne pourrait √™tre frein√©e qu'au f√©d√©ral seulement. Je vois pas trop ce que le municipal pourrait faire, et puis le provincial avec le TAL semble encadrer la location mieux qu'ailleurs au Canada.
Jesus, even the apartments that cost $600 are better than anything you can get in London for 3 times the price...
Cheap apartments is a huge selling point for Montreal and is the main reason I moved here. I'd hate to see that decline.
I gotta move back to Montreal.  You guys have it so good as far as cost of living
Je payais 575$ pour un bachelor proche du bord de l'eau √† LaSalle l'ann√©e pass√©e.
He said prices *started at* $500-600.
Guess he was right. Why the fuss?
So technically he wasn't wrong lol
Donc factuellement il avait raison de dire que **√ßa commence** a ce prix. car il semble pas avoir AUCUN logement en bas de 500$ sur l'ile
One chance, one shot, one opportunity
I found an apartment for 575$ in the West Island just a few weeks ago so i‚Äôd say close enough lol
Ya des gens qui ont pay√© 12$ pour leurs actions de Microsoft aussi et ce prix l√† n‚Äôest plus disponible. C‚Äôest moron de calculer le prix des logements sur le prix que certaines personnes payent depuis 20 ans quand c‚Äôest impossible de se loger √† ce prix l√†.
qui va vouloir d√©m√©nager avec un loyer si cheap? et s‚Äôils d√©m√©nagent c‚Äôest sur que le prochain locataire va payer 2x de plus au moins.
I think they do, I‚Äôve tripled my salary in the past decade. You can always find someone to pay you 10% more than whatever you‚Äôre making now, or change careers to something more lucrative.
On the other hand salaries for menial jobs remain low. But no one should strive to be a grocery store cashier as a career really...
"Nooon y'a pas a de crise de logements"
I mean it's one banana Michael. How much could it cost? Ten dollars?
Ah il voulait dire 5000000 pas 500, c‚Äôetait juste une typo...
Il n'a pas le droit d'avoir une maison de 5 millions? Je ne comprends pas ton commentaire.
It was only after a man died in a porta-potty that he exempted the homeless.
He's worth 10 millions, in France, he would be a Pequenot.
You know, being rich in Qu√©bec doesn't mean jackshit when it's come to other countries, even compared to the other provinces.
Would you believe it, France has 5000+ billionaires families. Where, in Qu√©bec, we have Desmarais, Jean Coutu, and the owner of Dollorama, which name evade me a the moment.
My point is that, even Fitzgibbon, with is 30m value is a smallfish.
He sold his home just last month. Five million dollars.
It's not really his responsibility to manage a city "crisis" either. People can also vote with their wallet. Nobody NEEDS to have a 5 and a half on the plateau. They want it, but it comes with a price. If the owners ask too much, they won't rent it... simple as that. Why would they ask a lower price when they can ask more and rent it?  
If I offer you 50$ or 200$, will you take only 50$? There are laws to avoid extorsion by the owners. But Renoviction, is 100% legal and if an owner want to invest in a building to improve the apartments and rent them at a higher price, they can...
They are busy profiting.
The truth is that the rising prices are 100% the responsibility of the city. If the zoning laws changed and allowed for all single story houses to be converted into triplexes we wouldn‚Äôt have any issue right now.
Our elected officials are the problem. They don‚Äôt want to work together with the population to create a solution. I don‚Äôt want affordable housing, I want to be able to afford to buy a house and we meet more co-ops. Put the power in the peoples hands and maybe all these useless politicians can go back to work in the private sector where they belong.

ü§£ü§£ Thanks! I'm gonna go next weekend then. Do they hang out there during daytime too?
Non, mais c‚Äôest p√©nible en maudit.
I‚Äôm honestly so angry rn - maybe it was just my section of the park, but people were being the most respectful I‚Äôve seen in awhile. Socially distanced, no crowds were too loud/rowdy, but I have never seen so many cops in my life. They kept circling the park after about 9PM and made it intensely uncomfortable to be there. The constant noise from the helicopter also drowned out any conversation you were having. So many of us don‚Äôt have large backyards and properties!! We rely on parks for socialization and normalcy... The SPVM is systematically trying to take this from us by creating a hostile and uncomfortable environment. The curfew may be gone but the pressure from the police to go home is still very much present... I just want to try to rebuild my social life at least a little lol

DEFUND THE POLICE
Probably unrelated, but does anyone know what happened in Parc Lafontaine around 2100?
Saw a cop push a lady 3 times with full force as a bunch of them were gathered around an ambulance. Not much later, I saw another cop car flying through the pedestrian path, almost hitting two different groups of kids, and an officer jumped out of the car and tackled someone to arrest them... 
Seemed like a very intense night compared to last friday..
I‚Äôve been wondering the same thing it‚Äôs right above my place
Lol fuck le gouvernement qui fait ENCORE du contr√¥le de la populasse . Je peux comprendre qu‚Äôon veut minimiser les contacts mais sacrament √ßa c‚Äôest de l‚Äôabus .

Hope everything is okay out there
It's heading out now. No idea what that was about.
I can't imagine the amount of money that was spent last night to harass some people hanging out in a park. 
Cops just doing everything they can to prove defunding is the right thing to do.
BON, y'√© enfin parti :P

This picture is the eastern edge of the Golden Square Mile with its mansions. You can see the imposing Ravenscrag mansion on the top left, across the McTavish reservoir and off of Pine Avenue. Poshest residence in Montreal with a lot of ground space and the mount surrounding it. It was eventually fused and expanded into the mental health wing of the Royal Victoria Hospital.
Very cool!! I never knew the soccer field covers what use to be a lake. Makes a lot of sense!
The extension to the football stadium is really an eyesore!
Would be nice to see the view from today
I imagine there was some controversy about the very tall (8- or 9-storey) apartment building right across from the main entrance to the McGill campus -- in 1925 it really dwarfed everything else right there among the stately mansions, and sticks out like a sore thumb in this picture.
C‚Äôest ou ce petit lac???
Bien oui, c'√©tait l'ancienne chaufferie. Maintenant le Ferrier Building je crois
Yes indeed. Fun fact: Golden Square Mile is not the term that was used back then, it was just Square Mile.
Golden Square Mile was written into a book, with Golden in quotes, to make a reference to the area's location of Montreal's 'Gilded Age'. It was never actually used to describe the area at the height of its wealth and power. It was just Square Mile.
Not a lake but a man-made [reservoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McTavish_reservoir). It's still there albeit covered by the field.
Maybe. There was a building height restriction in effect at the time that limited height based on the size of the lot, but didn't limit height based on location (such as we have today).
I can't quite figure out how the photo was taken, but if it was from the roof of a building, the Sun Life would be my guess. That said, I'd revise the date, as the Sun Life was only completed in 1931 and I believe they hadn't yet started building the tower in the mid-1920s. Otherwise it would have had to have been a low-flying airplane. 
That building still stands today, I think it's all super expensive apartments largely used by students. It was in the news a few years ago because the owner hadn't made a bunch of needed repairs. When it first opened it would have been just another luxury apartment building in the Square Mile, so I don't think anyone was really complaining. Sherbrooke had bigger buildings at that time.
C'est le r√©servoir McTavish avant qu'il ne devienne sous-terrain dans les ann√©es 50
Il est devenu le r√©servoir d‚Äôeau potable de la ville. Avant c‚Äô√©tait o√π est l‚Äôactuel Carr√© St-Louis. 
Le r√©servoir actuel subit des travaux majeurs. Le segment de la rue Docteur-Penfield qui le longe sera ferm√© pour plusieurs ann√©es.
Omg THAT‚ÄôS THE RESERVOIR THAT GAVE US FLOOD GIRL??
> I can't quite figure out how the photo was taken, but if it was from the roof of a building, the Sun Life would be my guess.
Given the sightline, it might've been taken from the top of the dome of Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral, which [Wikipedia says was completed in 1895](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary,_Queen_of_the_World_Cathedral). The Sun Life building wouldn't have been in the way then either.
Ahhhhhhhhhh ok ok

the balconies rarely get the wind due to the resistance found in alley ways and the mature maples on the streets. It's usually only when we place them on the streets, that they then fly all around onto people's heads next door.

Wow c‚Äôest fou comme vid√©o, well done!! Je n‚Äôai m√™me pas pu l‚Äôobserver de chez moi... Merci d‚Äôavoir captur√© ce moment üëäüèΩ
really nice!
I assume you had a special filter on your camera lens?
I tried taking a picture with my phone but it just looked like a big bright spot. Then I tried filming through my eclipse glasses, and while there was no brightness, everything else was pitch black.
Ou est ce parc?
So beautiful!
Merci pour la vid√©o.
Ne souciez pas, si t'es patient il y a un √©clipse solaire totale le 8 avril 2024 entre 15h et 16h de l'apr√®s-midi, dont la totalit√© passera au dessus de Montr√©al! √áa sera un gros √©venement pour toute la ville.
Merci :-) !
Yes I had a filter a long telephoto lens, what a gorgeous scene that was !
If you turned your brightness to the lowest possible you were able to see the moon on your phone but the quality was pretty bad

Une autre d√©couverte du jour :-)
thank you !
RemindMe! April 7 2024
good to know! although the next solar eclipse over MTL is 2024 i think, but knowing me, I'll probably have the same phone :)
No shit! Il est au bout de l'√Æle! La commission de toponymie manquait d'id√©es je pense.
Common sense. Donner des contraventions a des gens qui n'ont pas d'abri ni d'argent ni de soutiens, √ßa ne fait pas beaucoup de sens.
J'esp√®re que le PM Legault va faire preuve d'humanit√© par rapport a cette situation.
How are they not exempted already? It says you can't be "outside your residence". You can't be outside your residence if you don't have a residence.
It's embarrassing that this is actually a discussion.
Too little, too late. I am amazed that the Quebec government has seemingly convinced people to turn against their neighbors during this time and point the finger at each other instead of at the failure of a government we have. The real anger should come with why when they have had a year of interaction with this virus they have been unable to design and implement protocols that work? Why is their solution to give an already "hopped up on power" group of people the ability to fine individuals during an economic crisis? Why has no real help been provided? The curfew is ridiculous it is their attempt at pretending to do something while seemingly doing nothing. These same individuals allowed and supported police in DESTROYING a homeless encampment right before the start of winter, have allowed police officers to ticket these individuals, and have allowed police the ability to essentially enter peoples homes without warrant (which is incredibly alarming for people of color seeing as all, except the government of Quebec, know racism and classism run rampant in this province). As citizens of this province it is our right to make the government work in favor of the people. I applaud all individuals who are seemingly fine with the way this lockdown has been going and implore you to recognize the privilege of that stance. For many the lockdown is alarmingly dangerous. Whether it be for the homeless, whether it be for those afflicted by drug addictions, for those who are suicidal, or individuals who reside in homes with highly abusive environments that they cannot escape without the risk of fine. I am so tired of seeing people use New Zealand as an example when it was clear from the beginning that their government has been competent in their actions ensuring the benefit of their people. Stop getting angry at your neighbors and start demanding helpful and useful protocols from the government. Ones that are wholly scientifically based and biased against large groups of individuals.
10 minutes apr√®s, tout le monde s'habille en guenille pour pouvoir sortir...
Ok pourquoi on s'obstine sur des d√©tails, il devrait y avoir un block de gens qui font pression pour renverser le couvre-feu... √ßa n'a aucun fondement scientifique, c'est purement une distraction punitive pour l'incomp√©tence de Legault par rapport aux 5000+ morts en chsld pis son manque de leadership/transparence.
Triste qu'il ait fallu un mort pour que les choses changent.
Exemptions won't mean much. There is so much more that needs to be done. Community groups have tried to contact the mayors office for months about the impending tragedy, and they were met by silence, told not to call, and blocked from social media. 
This is Donald Trump level of criminal neglect.
It pisses me off that fines are only relevant to the working class. Rich motherfuckers dont give a shit about a 1000$ fine, and here we are. faudrait pas qu'un pauvre travailleur, √† qui le ticket serait douloureux √† payer, puisse faire semblant d'√™tre sans abris pour s'en tirer! Fuck Legault esti de vieux connard.
What happened to common sense?  Why drop a 1500$ fine on a person that is trying to figure out where to sleep or what to eat.  Why would the police need an exemption to figure this out?
I'm curious because Legault said people would just say their homeless to get out of a 1k fine. I can't say I disagree, people that don't have the means will say anything to get out of a fine. 
How do you prove that someone is not homeless? 
Anyway I do think it's horrendous giving out firms to homeless people...geez
>¬´Moi j‚Äôai tr√®s confiance en nos policiers. Je pense qu‚Äôils font un travail extraordinaire et ils ne font pas expr√®s pour donner des contraventions √† des itin√©rants¬ª, a-t-il dit.

Legault durant sa conf√©rence de presse mardi.
Ok... Donc pas d'exception mais il demande aux policiers de ne pas leurs donner des contraventions.
Well √ßa fait du sens. Ce que la mairesse demande, c‚Äôest d‚Äô√©crire dans l‚Äôarr√™t√© minist√©riel que √ßa ne s‚Äôapplique pas aux itin√©rants.
Alors √† tous ceux qui trouvent que c‚Äôest inhumain comment c‚Äôest pr√©sentement, je vous demande : c‚Äôest quoi la d√©finition ¬´¬†d‚Äôitin√©rant¬†¬ª? Qu‚Äôest-ce qui m‚Äôemp√™che de sortir le soir en disant aux policiers que je suis itin√©rant? √áa va tu √™tre √©crit noir sur blanc dans le r√®glement ¬´¬†si la personne pue, a des v√™tements trou√©s ou sales, c‚Äôest un itin√©rant¬†¬ª? Ben non. Mais alors m√™me si j‚Äôai un Kanuk avec des bottes en cuir pis chapeau fancy, y‚Äôa rien qui m‚Äôemp√™che d‚Äôaffirmer que je suis itin√©rant, et les policiers n‚Äôauraient aucune fa√ßon de v√©rifier mon statut de ¬´¬†sans-statut¬†¬ª. 
C‚Äôest simple, s‚Äôil y a une exception l√©gislative pour cette cat√©gorie de personnes, c‚Äôest du profilage social et √ßa demande de d√©finir le statut l√©gal d‚Äôune personne en se basant uniquement sur son apparence. La mairesse Plante comprend s√ªrement, mais fait de la politique avec √ßa, et c‚Äôest d√©plorable.
10 jours plus tard....
Plus que je la vois , plus qu‚Äôelle ressemble a Bruce Willis
√áa vient d'√™tre communiqu√© qu'il n'y aura pas d'exemption
>J'esp√®re que le PM Legault va faire preuve d'humanit√© par rapport a cette situation.
Si les gens s'indignent assez pour qu'il ait peur pour sa cote de popularit√©, mais sinon il se pr√©occupe d'eux autant que des gens sans adresse votent pour lui.
Vous pensez que le Trump Qu√©b√©cois  va faire preuve d‚Äôhumanit√©?
How would exempting them help? The man froze to death. Instructing police to bring him to a shelter would have saved him if shelters had enough room. The real problem is not enough shelter spaces.
La consigne, c'est de les diriger (et m√™me les emmener) vers un refuge qui a des disponibilit√©s et que l'amende n'est qu'en dernier recours.
Well, now that a gentleman has died in such an unfortunate situation, she'll pretend to give a shit. 
As if her page hasn't blocked/ignored an organization (organizations?) that had been appealing to her for this exact situation days prior.

J'esp√®re que c'est du sarcasme ton commentaire
Effectivement. Le monde qui se moquent de toi n'ont peut-√™tre pas vu les pubs sur kijiji pour louer un chien apr√®s 20h. Le monde sont fous. 
Les consignes du CAQ sont d'emmener les sans abris √† un refuge. Le probl√®me c'est clairement un manque de refuges! Leur laisser dehors apr√®s 20h ne va pas les prot√©ger du froid.
exactement. la mairesse le sais aussi, ce n'est juste que de la politique de sa part.
Le probl√®me c'est que les gens contre le couvre-feu (pour les bonnes raisons) ne veulent pas √™tre associ√©s aux conspirationnistes.
Il y a eu une manif anti couvre-feu et pro-science il y a 3 jours √† Hochelaga.
¬´ Over one-hundred protesters gathered in east-end Montreal yesterday afternoon (January 16, 2021), to express opposition to the government-imposed pandemic curfew as well as to highlight measures to combat the pandemic rooted in solidarity and support for the most marginalized of society. The demonstration, which successfully marched through the streets of Hochelaga, emphasized the cruel negative impacts of the curfew and related police harassment on the homeless, sex workers, drug users, undocumented workers and others.
The demo organizers -- an ad hoc group called Pas de solution polici√®re √† la crise sanitaire / No police solution to a health crisis -- emphasized that the protest was in favour of COVID-19 mitigation measures, but rejected the curfew as authoritarian and detrimental to an effective pandemic response. The organizers also made a point of rejecting the involvement and presence of anyone associated with far-right, anti-science, conspiracy theorists, highlighting instead a social justice-rooted, pro-science approach to the pandemic (exemplified by one sign at the protest reading: "pro-science, pro-mask, pro-vaccine, anti-curfew"). ¬ª

Nothing changed. Legault just announced that they won‚Äôt be exempted... extremely sad indeed
Rien ne changera; l'argument est que les gens qui se font pogner vont dire qu'ils sont robineux pour √©chaper au ticket...
did the mayor impose a curfew?
Q: What do you think the cops do with homeless people when there is no curfew ?
A: Apparently the same thing they do when there is one. Gotta Fine 'em all!!
Well, you force that person to goto a shelter for the night. At some point you will realize you're not going home anymore
Et se fier au 'bon jugement des policiers' n'est pas une bonne chose. Si tu es polis avec eux, √ßa peut passer. Si tu as des probl√®mes mentaux et que c'est moins le fun de dealer avec toi, ils peuvent bien te donner une amendes parce que tu les fait chier. 
Que ce soit √©crit dans le d√©cret ou non, comment les policiers peuvent bien se fier √† leur bon jugement si quelqu'un se d√©guise? Et comment savent-ils si la personne est d√©guis√© ou pas?
This seems like just another tool for the police to oppress the poor. As somebody who works from home and lives in the suburbs this has 0 effect on me, but boy does it fuck with people who don't have those luxuries. These law makers seem to have no empathy for those with tougher situations than their own.
WTF? Hostie que c'est con. Comme si la situation des sans-abris √©tait pas assez merdique de m√™me. √áa m'enrage. C'est inhumain.
What a heartless fucking awful person. An Inuk man died because of this, because shelters must close in the evening too, a person has DIED. I am so pissed. I need to find out where I can send me complaints too.
everyday that passes I hate this "businessman" more and more
&#x200B;
cest un vrai con, et encore pire  inhumain
A-t-on une source pour cette information incendiaire?
Je ne comprends pas pourquoi, c'est quoi qui bloque ou. C'est tu a cause que s'il font une exception pour eux, √ßa ouvre la porte a d'autres exception? Je ne vois pas comment √ßa inspire le peuple √ßa. Je sais que PM Legault est orient√© business, est ce qu'il y a un enjeu d'affaires ici?
√áa en prendrait pas mal vu l'absence de comp√©tition.
J'peux pas sentir Legault, mais tu trouves pas que t'exag√®res un tantinet quand m√™me?
"We are going to build a wall to keep all of the homeless out of Montreal. It's going to be yuge. Simply tremendous."
Pourquoi tu parles de Maxime Bernier ici ?
The man froze to death right outside a shelter. The shelter was shut down because of curfew.
Les refuges qui √©taient d√©j√† d√©bord√©s avant le couvre-feu...
Still, I don't see how they can legally be fined if they don't have residences.
Which organization?
>De fa√ßon grise.

Ils ne sont clairement pas exclus...

Hiring on merit should never be an issue. I support equality of opportunity not of outcomes.
Damn, when did merit stop being good enough?
This is a whole bunch of stupidity and bad politics, not unexpected from an American scientist.
He got grants rejected because he refused to fulfill some basic bureaucratic obligation that everyone else at the university is obviously having no difficulty doing. From the article it appears that all he needs to do is simply make a stated declaration that he will consider diversity in hiring or something, which he refused to do so he could make his stupid reactionary point. 
Don't put your egghead politics above the health of your research program and you won't have any problems.
J'ai beaucoup d'admiration pour ce monsieur, si vous lisez ceci, bravo pour vos convictions.
De m√™me coup, honte a l'appareil gouvernemental f√©d√©ral qui a compl√®tement perdu les p√©dales.
"the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, gave Dr. Lana Ray, a professor at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ont., a $1.2-million grant to study cancer prevention using traditional Indigenous healing practices. When the award was announced, Ray said ‚ÄúWe need to stop framing prevalent risk factors of cancer as such and start thinking about them as symptoms of colonialism.‚Äù" 
This is the part that interests me. What kind of healing practices are we talking about here and why are we bringing colonialism into cancer research? Is that even relevant?
Knowing how the engineering labs are staffed, I'm pretty sure it's a matter of gender equality rather than color of skin. I would have said that yes, finding women is hard in engineering, but chemical ? I have seen chemical engineering labs almost full with women of colors, so let me have some doubts about him hiring "based on merits".
Source: Spent way too much time in Uni labs in this city.
This is a really hard issue.  When I was younger I would have probably sided with Prof. Kambhampati, but now I don't really agree.  We have seen time and time again that just the act of inclusion and diversity breed more inclusion and diversity which in turn promotes voices that we normally wouldn't have heard. He is a scientist so if he really wants to understand he should probably look into the research.
>‚ÄúI think what‚Äôs happened is the woke and the social justice warriors have made a moralistic argument the way the religious right used to make moralistic arguments. And now people are afraid to challenge them. But I think it‚Äôs okay to say I believe that equality is a morally valid position. I believe that meritocracy is a morally valid position.‚Äù
Sorry but using the term 'woke' and social justice warriors hurts your argument.  Those are derogatory terms and not desirable for civilized discussion.  Its not a religion, its math.  Women make up 50% of the population, but I assume your lab is no where near 50% female.  Hence why government grants probably want you to consider being more diverse.
It seems like NSERC has been completely captured by the EDI true believers and opportunists. Look no further than their embarrassing response to the Tomas Hudlicky essay in 2020. Everyone, including the NSERC president, was quick to denounce what was a fairly standard conservative opinion.
The only way I see this changing in the short-term is if the QC government tells the federal government to stop forcing our scientists to pass these EDI purity tests. There's basically no political pressure coming from anywhere else as all the university admins are on board with the program.
Long-term, these are bad ideas and will run their course but by that point our universities will be filled with a bunch of mediocre researchers.
Well, he has a point.
Juger une personne selon sa race au lieu de ses m√©rites = √™tre raciste.
Ce prof n'a pas eu sa subvention parce qu'il n'√©tait pas assez raciste.
First of all, we all know how fucked up and literally shooting in the dark looking hiring is. We haven‚Äôt figured out this hiring thing, yeah it‚Äôs pretty hard. Anyone who thinks it‚Äôs easy hasn‚Äôt really done it enough and certainly anyone who thinks people hire just on merit is a dumbo (expect a reddit sub to be full of folks who have never hired a single person in their lives, and hopefully never in a position to do so. Think overpaid software engineer who thinks he is king of the world for writing some lines of code some lame ass adtech company) Yeah it‚Äôs easier to hire based on merit in some disciplines and industries relative to others but this ‚ÄúwE onLy Hire On MeriT‚Äù isn‚Äôt going to cut it either. That argument died 10 years ago so people be ready to have something else. Just go do a tour of STEM undergrads or even high schools and see how dismissive and sexist guys can be towards their female colleagues as well as the attitudes teachers and professors who are men can have towards them and then you got some dumbass talking about equality of opportunity or whatever. This is like the guy who is like why can‚Äôt you get an A in calculus man,  just quite your job and focus on classes, easy for you to say when your dad is paying your rent and has 100k waiting for you to use in a downpayment for a condo. There is no such thing as equality of opportunity. You must be some privileged upper class white man with the endowment benefits of having had ancestors who were colonizers, slave owners and coerced their way into becoming land owners to think that.
Not recruiting based on merit is discrimination at this point. At this point we systematically favor PoCs which kinda already taints what merit constitutes since some people were given opportunities they didn't necessarily deserve in the first place.
These are some big claims. Odd that the only evidence to back it up is, "I‚Äôve had two people say that was the kiss of death.‚Äù Apparently all of academia and society is crumbling because two random anonymous people said so.
The tread over in /r/canada has lots of info in it for anyone interested.

But yeah, he hiRes BaSEd on MeRIt.
If he truly believes in merit, then why does he support potentially having more privileged White people on his team who probably wouldn't be there if people of colour had more equal opportunities?
Beautiful comment by Simone Lefebvfe in the original article - worth highlighting so it reaches more audience:
‚ÄúMaybe we should hire blind people to fly Air Canada jets. Or maybe people with Parkinson‚Äôs disease who shake non stop to perform open heart surgeries? Ya know, equity and all.‚Äù
Are we redefining how scientific doctrines should be managed by bureaucrats, sidelining Canadian interests? üòî
Edit: I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on why the downvotes. Here‚Äôs my logic: I see them as professionals first: Doctors, Engineers, mathematicians. I don‚Äôt see the reason to introduce race/ gender/ creed/ sexual orientation etc. esp. ‚Äúin a scientific doctrine‚Äù where they can enter on their merit.
In other words, in my humble opinion (and I may be wrong so please correct me): should someone be chosen if they are (female/ LGBTQ/ white or non-white) rather than what potential or capabilities they show?
Yes but we don't have equality of opportunities if poor people don't get the same education and lived experience. Which may be impossible really... So why not just have representative employment at easy to do public jobs?
Don't tell your employer, you'll be next on the chopping block.
It never did. The people who get their positions on merit aren't the ones complaining.
The only folks who get riled up about "merit" are the mediocre masses who are managing to squeak on by in life. They dislike measures that assist minorities because they see them as a threat to what little status they have. The people who actually have merit have NO problems finding grants or jobs or anything for that matter because they actually have skills.
Les politiques des ann√©es 70-90, bas√© sur l'id√©e que la couleur de la peau et le sexe c'est superficiel et pas important, ont trop bien fonctionn√©.

Around 2003
I mean... the headline itself tells you this article is a thinly-disguised editorial, and not an objective reporting of news. It's the National Post. This ''woke-ism is destroying society'' stuff is their bread and butter, while they and the Globe and Mail continue to wonder why no one under 50 even knows they exist anymore.  
Anyone who thinks the National Post is an objective source, or understands or cares about Quebec, should go back and look at how they reported on the 2012 student protests.
First, as far as EDI is concerned he's Indian. Second, he didn't refuse any obligation. He wrote up an EDI section for his grant but it was still rejected. What he wrote seems very reasonable and is not dismissive of EDI, so I can understand why he's pissed off:
"The academic team consists of the PK group. Our group is highly diverse, being populated by men and women from many countries and religions and cultures. Our group is also highly diverse in terms of intellectual background and research areas of expertise. Our group has a long history of inclusion of women into ultrafast laser science, which has some of the lowest populations of women in STEM. The corporate partners are also highly diverse, spanning several countries of origin with a number of women in STEM in key roles for Photon Etc and few-cycle. We will recruit a diverse array of students and HQP during the course of this project. We will hire the most qualified people based upon their skills and mutual interests, with outreach activities to help. We will advertise in Women in STEM organizations. We will recruit via word of mount, noting my recent female PhD is now on a tenure track position in Physics in Germany. She is now one of the leading young women in physics in the globe, who was trained and mentored in my system."
https://twitter.com/DorianAbbot/status/1461447368491028482
He actually did write a statement about how his team is/will be diverse and the panel considering his grant deemed it insufficient not because of his actual research proposal, but on that diversity statement alone. He wrote one, it just wasn't good enough for them and that alone was disqualifying.
>He got grants rejected because he refused to fulfill some basic bureaucratic obligation
Forced quotas based on race, religion, gender etc are not 'basic bureaucratic obligations'
>Don't put your egghead politics above the health of your research program and you won't have any problems.
Not hiring the best people and being forced to hire based on external characteristics that have nothing to do with the position is literally putting egghead politics above all else.
Fais pas trop confiance √† l'article. Quand tu demandes des financement acad√©mique, la moindre erreur est fatale. J'ai perdu 35 000$ de financement parce que j'ai mal num√©ris√© un document et les 2 cm du bas √©taient manquant. Je connais quelqu'un qui √©tait dans une √©quipe qui a perdu 170 000$ de financement car ils ont utilis√© le mauvais style bibliographique. Le professeur dans l'article √† refus√© de dire qu'il allait consid√©rer les crit√®res √âDI (√©quit√©, diversit√© et inclusion). Il avait m√™me pas besoin de le faire pour de vrai, juste de dire qu'il allait le faire. Une demande non remplie est une demande non admissible. Il n'a pas √©t√© refus√© car il a simplement pas √©t√© consid√©r√©. C'est comme √ßa que fonctionne l'acad√©mie et il en √©tait tr√®s conscient. Son objectif √©tait purement de jouer la victime et de bl√¢mer le "wokeism"
In case you're looking for a serious answer: Indigenous communities in Canada often live in *extremely* poor environmental & socioeconomic conditions. Food in northern and remote communities (including Indigenous communities) is [extremely expensive](https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/20-hamburgers-and-2-bananas-the-cost-of-food-insecurity-in-canada-s-north-1.5154743) and of poor quality (processed junk is *much* cheaper than fresh produce, for example). Basic necessities (such as soap) are similarly expensive. There have been [significant ongoing water quality crises](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/30/canada-first-nations-justin-trudeau-drinking-water) in Indigenous communities, caused by a number of environmental factors. Here's a gov't website showing there are currently [43 ongoing drinking water advisories](https://www.sac-isc.gc.ca/eng/1506514143353/1533317130660). 
So to begin with, it's extremely difficult for Indigenous communities to access healthy food and clean water. And these things only exacerbate the proven health effects of poverty.
Healthcare for Indigenous people in Canada is basically a [gigantic fucking mess](https://yellowheadinstitute.org/2021/02/04/the-failure-of-federal-indigenous-healthcare-policy-in-canada/). They aren't covered under provincial health plans, and the system that does exist for reimbursement is super complicated and frustrating to access. And it still doesn't cover much.
This is what it means when we talk about "colonialism" in this context. Basically, Canada's health and social systems are *designed* to put Indigenous people at a severe disadvantage. 
Now, when we talk about "Indigenous healing practices", it doesn't mean someone's going to do tribal magic over a bowl of entrails or tobacco or whatever. More likely, it refers to adopting healthcare approaches based on the medicine wheel and similar traditions.
Broadly, the difference between Western and Indigenous medicine is in the approach‚ÄîWestern medicine is individualized, physical, and disease-based while Indigenous healing is holistic (physical, mental, emotional, spiritual) and community-driven. So while the doctors you might be used to would focus on one problem, fix it, and send you on your way, an Indigenous healer might check in on your mental health and ask about your relationships when you come in. Neither way is *right*, but they're based in fundamentally different beliefs.
I'm not sure what the relevant risk factors for cancer that the article mentions are, but it sounds like the intention is to move away from thinking of these "risk factors" as an isolated list of things and to instead consider how they're a part of people's lives, and what can be done to help people find safer alternatives.
Idk if I‚Äôm interpreting this right but this is what I I think she means: Indigenous people are more likely to experience certain risk factors for cancer (I‚Äôm assuming lifestyle factors) and her belief is that these risks are common in indigenous folks as a result of colonialism. So her plan is to get rid of the risk factors by starting at the root cause. So the traditional healing practices would be things that reduce whatever the risk factors are. That‚Äôs my take at least
I don‚Äôt see how it is relevant at all.
Professor number one got their grant rejected for not meeting diversity criteria.
Professor two in a different field in a different city in a different province applying to a different grant from a different government organization got their grant approved in a research field that people might feel shouldn‚Äôt be researched. 
The link isn‚Äôt directly stated but implied so we can all get angry about the irrationality of people who think diversity is important instead of discussing the reasons of each situation individually and whether or not each makes sense.
I'm going to hazard a guess that it's not.
You shouldn't have to try to hire women or minorities, but whoever would be best. At one point we collectively decided we shouldn't give a shit about the gender or ethnicity of people. But now it's important again.
You know who super happy right now? The far right. Because the far left is pushing normal people towards them.
Moderate left wingers need to confront these assholes or we'll be in deep shit in no time.
i think he's in chemistry, not chem eng. 
being a chem eng myself from his uni, we have a 50/50 split when it comes to gender.
Yeah he's just in chemistry, not chemical engineering, where there are definitely less women than men as graduate students
You can see all his grad students past and present here: http://www.kambhampati-group.mcgill.ca/people.html
We need equality of opportunity, not equality of results.
The National Post publishing deliberately inciteful articles? Never in my life would I have imagined it!!

>We have seen time and time again that just the act of inclusion and diversity breed more inclusion and diversity which in turn promotes voices that we normally wouldn't have heard. 
What does this have to do with the ability to do the job?  Answer: Nothing!
>He is a scientist so if he really wants to understand he should probably look into the research.
I'm sure he's already busy with his own research instead of validating YOUR point of view.  
&#x200B;
>Sorry but using the term 'woke' and social justice warriors hurts your argument. Those are derogatory terms and not desirable for civilized discussion. 
Stop trying to police language to silence someone or control the discussion.  You don't like the terms, then don't use em.  
>Its not a religion, its math. Women make up 50% of the population, but I assume your lab is no where near 50% female. Hence why government grants probably want you to consider being more diverse.
Just because women are 50% of the population doesn't mean they will be represented on a one to one ratio with men in any given field of employment.  People are individuals and they make their own choices.
Inclusion and diversity that you promote is only ever good when the minoritiee are more numerous than white males.
You, and anyone like you, will ALWAYS defend an entire company of POC and women, but still expect boards of white people or male to promote more diversity.
You are just biased and racist, for whatever reason.
Merit is the only thing that should matter when recruiting
Maybe it's mostly because women have different preferences than men? Gosh the thought that men and women are different! Holy crap
>  Women make up 50% of the population, but I assume your lab is no where near 50% female
This argument makes no sense. I doubt women make up 50% of the pool of individuals who have the qualifications to work in that lab. By your logic all professions should have an equal number of men and women at all times. How many female lumberjacks or garbagemen do you think exist? The most qualified individual should be getting hired, all the more so in a field like science where there are only facts and having a diverse number of voices and opinions isn't as important (like in design, or government).
So we should have a perfect 50/50 split for garbage removers, construction workers, plumbers and janitors too; right?
You are a danger to society!  Nuancing the conversation about equality of outcome policy. Boo. Keep out my town.
donc toutes les jobs devrait √™tre 50% hommes, 50% femmes? les trans, non binaires, et autres, ils sont dans quelle cat√©gorie? Combien de % de jobs devrait aller √† ces groupes? Les postes d'infirmiers dans les hopitaux, est-ce que 50% devraient √™tre garder pour des hommes? On s'arr√™te ou ?
En tant que personne qui a vot√© Coderre aux deux derni√®res √©lections, pis qui √©tait pas trop certain de la candidature de Plante y'a 4 ans (m√™me si j'avais rien a priori contre son programme), ben j'm'en vais voter pour elle cette fois, aucune h√©sitation.
Pu capable de Coderre. Y'a juste pu rapport, et je sais m√™me plus quoi il est suppos√© amener. Je pense m√™me pas qu'il le sait lui-m√™me.
Y'a 4 ans Plante avait pas d'exp√©rience, c'est ce qui me faisait douter. Mais l√† elle en a, et franchement, m√™me si son mandat a pas √©t√© parfait, c'√©tait suffisamment bien pour la reconduire.
Honestly, I'm not crazy about a lot of things she's done but she seems to be competent and I also remember how bad it was under Coderre. At least when she spends money, we are getting useful things that improve the city.
*"Because she's not Coderre."*  Saved everyone five minutes.
The author of the article is on point about Plante's accomplishments and the many challenges she was up against. And the fact there wasn't any corruption scandal during her tenure is a big plus.
Definitely, I'm voting for Projet Montreal and Valerie's team.
I hope Denis Coderre stays out of politics for good after his defeat.
Best part:
>While Coderre has always boasted about flashy projects that were supposed to ‚Äúput Montreal on the map,‚Äù Plante, in fact, did just that ‚Äî but in her own way. Urban landscapers and environmentalists around the world point to our city as an example of so many things being done right. Montreal has never been more of a joy to walk and bike in, to sit in a park, on a terrasse, or by the waterfront. As far as I‚Äôm concerned, that matters ‚Äî not only for ecological reasons but for the sheer joy of urban living.
Quand Denis Coderre est entr√© en poste, la barre √©tait tr√®s tr√®s basse. En gros, s'il arrivait √† ne pas √™tre corrompue, les gens allaient √™tre content... Mais apr√®s 4 ans, je pense que les montr√©alais se sont rendu compte que ce n'√©tait pas suffisant, surtout apr√®s tout les fiascos qu'ils nous a fait endurer (Formule E, VLS √©lectrique, etc).
C'est d'autant plus dr√¥le parce que maintenant, il refuse de publier ses sources de revenue "avant d'√™tre √©lu". Donc le peu qu'il pouvait offrir (l'√©thique), il l'a perdu.
Val√©rie Plante n'est certainement pas parfaite, mais au moins elle propose une vision progressiste de la ville.
Last year, I almost ran over some cyclists head when he, out of nowhere, swerved and fell face down on the road. Gotta say, almost decapitating someone at 5:45 am kinda messes up your day. Thats why I want more bike lanes, so that they aren't in the way of 1500 lbs+ metal deathmachines.
By pulling a "Trump", Coderre proves why he does not deserve our vote.
**He literally said that he would release his tax returns ONLY if he gets elected...**

Coderre is a con man!
Already voted! Stressful time to be a Montrealer
[deleted]
People dunk on Coderre here all the time, but I don't hear about any reasons for disliking Plante. Yes she's better than Coderre, but why do people dislike her?
I appreciate the open conversation taking place here
Coderre is such a sleaze ball. I hope Valerie Plante wins.
This is kind of a no-brainer
My question is more about Sue Montgomery - did Plante completely screw up their relationship or is Montgomery a power hungry maniac? Or both? I basically want Projet to have another term and continue to make Montreal change, but i also want to send the message that Valerie and friends have got to learn politics better and end the public embarrassments and self inflicted wounds. I'm wondering whether to split my vote ie one for Plante and one for Montgomery.
JE NE VOTERAI JAMAIS POUR CETTE FEMME! Parce que j‚Äôhabite √† Qu√©bec. J‚Äôadooore Montreal et je n‚Äôai aucun plan d‚Äôaller y habiter √† court terme. Mais mettons‚Ä¶ vite de m√™me je voterais certainement contre Denis Coderre.
Anyone but that corrupt gangster Coderre.
I would have probably skipped my vote if Coderre did not show up. She got my vote already nonetheless, because I still recognize the sleazy arrogant Coderre, who‚Äôs still the same aside of his lighter weight

This is my first municipal election since I moved to Montreal.  What should I know?
Il n'y a jamais eu de "nouveau Denis". It's a TRAP.
I don't know how i ended up here but i'm definitely voting for Coderre just because he loves and respects black people
Go, Val√©rie!
Affordable housing... Plante... ????????????
She is all about quality of life if you live on the Plateau and she had nothing of value against the the costs that overrun the city. Codere took the fight to the unions directly in overcostx
Jamais!
She supports Bill 96 so she‚Äôs just as ignorant as Legault and Blanchet. Next!
Who cares it's 110% rigged üôÑ

She wants to further punish law abiding gun owners by asking the federal government to ban handguns and "assault weapons", so that's a no from me
I only have three issues with Plante which I‚Äôm sure she will work on for her next mandate.
First, she puts so much focus on making the bike paths accessible during winter that the sidewalks of pedestrians are a complete mess. I understand that as a progressive city, you want bikes over cars, but it shouldn‚Äôt penalize people that walk.
Secondly, it really feels like the security of Montreal is going down a rabbit hole. There‚Äôs more and more violence and its not just the north east end, but downtown as well. Especially old port.
Lastly, I feel like the construction on the island is even slower than before. More and more sites are being opened for repairs and they just never end. Take Peel street for example, it just doesn‚Äôt end.
Can we agree theyre all bad choices?
Far leftist voting for far leftist candidat who would have thought.
Why I'm voting for Denis Codere....Valerie Plante.
If I get downvoted, so be it.
Elle est √† chier, mais Coderre c'est Coderre. Je ne sais pas encore pour qui je vais voter.
I'm a little amazed that people forget there is a viable third candidate  in Mouvement Montreal. Don't like Plante or Coderre then vote for someone else!
J'aime mieux une mairesse qui se soucie plus de ses citoyens en favorisant les pi√©tons et les cyclistes qu'un maire qui se soucie juste des compagnies et des automobilistes qui viennent d'ailleurs.
Exactly...it's wild how Coderre is accusing her of spending on "frivolous" things when he blew huge sums of money on things like the Formula E, ugly granite stumps in the park, and gaudily lighting up the Champlain.  For the vast majority of people, these are not amenities.
I like her style. She needs more time.
Precisely my thoughts
I am asking this without any aggressivity, I am still a bit new to Mtl politics and just trying to understand What is the main things you dislike about Plante ?
Like what?
There's a lot more going on than just this.
I'll just throw out the incredible job they have done on parks, green spaces, bicycle infrastructure, and generally keeping things better for the public.
"Being not Coderre" is huge!
Same deal for Ville St. Laurent. Alan DeSousa has been the VSL Mayor for ages, and it's time for some new blood.
A lot of sketchy nonsense construction projects, plus he flipped his lid and FORCED a school near his home to change their after-school dismissal schedule because the buses were delaying his afternoon commute (I wish I was making this up).
Exactly.

Si les chiffres remontent dans 1-2 semaines, il faut pas etre un 100 watts pour voir le lien.
Je ne comprends toujours pas pourquoi il y a un couvre-feu alors que les √©coles sont ouvertes.
C'est incoh√©rent de laisser un foyer √©vident de transmission (avec son lot de r√®gle de distanciation contre-intuitive) ouvert alors que tu restreint les mouvements de la population.
√áa devrait √™tre ¬´ toute ou pantoute ¬ª dans une direction ou l'autre, pas un peu des deux en faisant du surplace.

800+ enfants sans masque jouant les uns sur les autres √† la r√©cr√© tous les jours dans toutes les √©coles? Non.
Travaillant dans une √©cole secondaire sur l'√Æle de Montr√©al, je vais r√©pondre:   
Oui.
Je suis vraiment tann√© du couvre feu, d√©j√† mon m√©tier de camionneur √©tait pas facile avec les r√®gles. Avant 2020 j avais jamais a retenir un envie de chier pendant 3-4h parce que j ai pu acc√®s √† des toilettes.

Ben l osti de mcdo √† c√¥t√© d un truck stop veut pas j aye chercher ma commande √† l int√©rieur, veut pas je passe au service au volant √† pied, pis ben c'est pas comme si je vais Parker mon 53' dans le parking pour qui viennent me le porter. D√©j√† cot√© truck stop dans r√©gion de Montr√©al sa fait dure. Tous √ßa pour que Lecon nationale peut se donner une tappe dans le dos en se disant : j ai fait de quoi!
The most frustrating part of all this (beyond Legault‚Äôs incompetence, corruption and flagrant conflict of interest) is that we will have learned nothing. If another pandemic hit 12 months from now, we would rinse and repeat everything that is happening now. No one talks about how shitfully poor our health care infrastructure is. Why did the system collapse so easily? Where does the funding go Mr Legault? Why is our entire public infrastructure trash?
Est ce que l'eau est mouill√©?
Si tu fermes les √©coles, il faut que tu donnes du soutien financier aux travailleurs afin qu'ils puissent rester √† la maison avec leurs jeunes. Le conseil du patronat laissera jamais le gouvernement faire √ßa, et Legault tiendra jamais t√™te au conseil du patronat. 
Ils disent qu'ils les gardent ouvertes pour le bien des enfants, mais tant qu'√† moi c'est assez clair que c'est plut√¥t pour √©viter de priver les entreprises de leur "capital humain" exploitable.
Mon ami et sa famille (blonde, fille, gars, m√®re, p√®re, beau-p√®re et soeur) ont tous pogn√© le covid m√™me si ils √©taient vigilants. La sant√© publique croit que c'est le plus jeune qu'il l'a ramener de l'√©cole.

O rly?
Le vrai probl√®me est que le gouvernement utilise les donn√©es de sant√© publique pour prendre ses d√©cisions et les mod√®les utilis√©s sont faits pour √©valuer la viralit√© dans la population adulte.
Ces mod√®les ne semblent pas tenir compte (j'ai cherch√© et n'ai trouv√© aucune donn√©es sur le sujet) du fait que c'est plus de 70% des enfants qui sont asymptomatiques. 
Le mod√®le utilise le temoignage des patients quant √† la source de leur foyer d'infection.
Si tu travailles, que tu as des petits √† l'√©cole et que tu contractes le virus, ton premier r√©flexe sera de bl√¢mer les transports en commun ou l'environnement de travail si tes kids ne montrent aucuns sympt√¥mes.
R√©sultat des courses une sous-repr√©sentation significative du niveau de viralit√© des enfants √† l'√©cole.

Mais est-ce que quelqu'un peut bien gentiment POURQUOI cette obsession de garder les √©coles ouvertes? 
Je demande pas une opinion si c'est mauvais ou non, je cherche √† conna√Ætre la motivation. Pourquoi le gouvernement semble y tenir mordicus?
In other news, fire is hot. ‚ÄúTouch it to see if it‚Äôs hot, it‚Äôs a calculated risk‚Äù says Legault.
Est-ce qu'il y a d'autres choses qui ont seulement √©t√© ouvertes entre septembre et la mi d√©cembre?
√áa fait des mois que je le dis, et je suis un imb√©cile sur l'internet. Mais non, le probl√®me c'est pas les centaines d'enfants rassembl√©s √† l'√©cole, c'est moi qui aimerait bien recevoir deux personnes aux deux semaines prendre un caf√© chez nous.
[removed]
Tout le monde se plaint des √©coles ouvertes. Quelle serait l'alternative?
Pour certains parents c'est un gros probl√®me. Par exemple, un de mes amis est pompier et sa conjointe est infirmi√®re. Tous les deux sont travailleurs essentiels. Leurs enfants sont en bas √¢ge et ne peuvent pas √™tre laiss√©s sans surveillance. Un est en maternelle et l'autre en 3e. On ne peut pas se fier ben ben √† les laisser seuls √† faire des cours en-ligne non plus ,car les parents doivent √™tre l√† pour les accompagner et les aider.
Qu'est-ce qu'il sont suppos√© faire si les √©coles ferment?
Yeeeeeeep. J'ai vu des √©l√®ves enlever leur masque pour tousser, partager des poutines, boire dans les m√™mes bouteilles d'eau, s'embrasser sur les joues, s'asseoir avec des √©l√®ves d'autres groupes sans distanciation et sans masque. On devrait inclure dans les chiffres scolaires les membres de la famille qu'ils contaminent.
3rd and 4th waves too.
Je pense que oui moi aussi mais dure a dire exactement c est pas pire que les compagnie qui ne permette pas le travail a distance et qui ne sont pas essenciel
Ce qui me fait de la misere c'est que ma soeur arrive a un an en tele-ecole en Argentine. L'etat a mis tout les moyens pour garantir l'acces a l'internet pi a un ordinateur personel par enfant. Les pedagogues se font fermer la yeulle: le trauma de tuer sa propre famille est pire que de rater une annee scolaire. Elle va bien, bien mieux de vivre dans la peur d'etre la potentielle cause de contamination de mes parents 50+ qui s'approchent de la 60ene.
L'argentine, pays qui a une situation financiere bien pire que le Quebec, fait de meilleurs choix.
L'argentine fabrique ses propres vaccins maintenant, ayant obtenus un ayant droit de la Russie: ils produisent en masse le vaccin Spoutnik V. Ma soeur, ma mere, mon pere, tous aurons le vaccins avant moi, avant la majorite des Quebecois. C'est honteux pour le Quebec. Rien que la politique vaccinale ne fait aucun sense et est fondamentalement un choix ridicule geopolitique. On a pas assez de Pfizer ou de Moderna? Et ben estie c'est pas bien dure d'aller voire la Russie ou la Chine. Tabarnak. 
Sans parler du fait  que l'occident en son assemble a totalement naise sur les strategies de confinement. C'est pourtant pas bien complique: de un, le confinement individuel dans ton foyer c'est cave en estie. Tu le propage a tout le foyer. Fait que tu test positif? Tu vas en centre de quarantaine avec les autres positifs, isole du foyer.
De deux, tu fermes toutes les ecoles. Ecole a maison, basta.
De trois, tu fait parvenir le salaire a tout les travailleurs non essentiel qui n'ont pas acces au teletravail mais dont l'activite n'est pas importante pour le peuple: 1) retail qu'est pas necessaire. 2) bars et restaurants. 3) constructions et manufacture industrielle non necessaire, etc. PCU universelle sans conditions pi gel des loyers et des hypotheques. Au frais de l'etat. Si il manque des piasses, ben on nationalise des industries et on augmente les taxes aux bourgeois. M'en caliss.
Enfin, contact tracing sans mercie. Obligation d'installation de l'app covid. Obligation de quarantaine de 14 jours a l'hotel avec surveillance policiere pour tout voyageur entrant, citoyen, resident (permanent ou temporaire), ou touriste.

Je peux te garantir que l'economie, et la sante mentale collective/nationale, ben elles seraient en meilleurs formes si on aurais fait comme la chine/le vietnam/la coree/la nouvelle zelande.

Si les cas remontent, √ßa pourrait ne pas emp√™cher Legault d'invoquer d'autres raisons et ses disciples de reprendre b√™tement ses propos.
Les chiffres ont mont√©s tres haute depuis le 25 decembre pendant que les √©coles etait ferm√©es pour les vacances.  Donc c'est certain que les rasemblements priv√©s sont responsables et je ne croit pas que sa va se limiter a des rasemblements de noel.
Presentement on voit que les chiffres descend.  Le conclusion probable est que la couvre feux est efficace.  On va verifier les chiffres pendant les prochaines semaines avec la reouverture des ecoles.
La seule conclusion est que fermer les ecoles pendant noel a eu peu d'impacte sur le nombre des cas COVID.
Je pense que c'est tout √† fait coh√©rent pour une soci√©t√© de prioriser certaines activit√©s au d√©pend de d'autres jug√©es moins essentielles.
Parce que l'√©cole c'est plus important que d'aller prendre une marche √† -20¬∞C au mois de janvier.
[deleted]
Je pense que la d√©cision de faire les deux peut √™tre vu d'un sens logique:
La plupart des personnes hospitalis√© sont des a√Æn√©s. Disons que les enfants sont un agent de propagation important - si les enfants sont pas √† l'√©cole, ils vont √™tre garder par leur grandparents pendant que maman et papa travaillent, et vont aller jouer ensembles au parcs ou en groups √† la maison. Les ados ne suit pas les r√®gles de distanciation de se que j'ai vu. Si les enfants sont √† l'√©cole et il n'y a pas de couvre-feu, les grandparents vont venir les voir, et vont faire du babysitting un ou deux soirs par semaine parce que les grandparents s'en fou des r√®gles.
Avec les √©coles ouvert et un couvre-feu en place, Legault et co. ont coup√© les vecteurs liant les enfants aux a√Æn√©s. C'est sa, je pense, la logique. Si sa va marcher ou non, je ne sais pas.

Kids at school = parents can work.
If everyone stops working, there is no more cash flow. No cash flow = everyone starves. 
It's not hard to understand.
Le manque de jugement est grand, comment pas voir les enfants partageant le virus?
Je conna√Æs quelqu'un qui travaile dans une √©cole primaire, et il y existe une certaine s√©paration: Les lunchs se font en classe, les r√©cr√©s se font √† moiti√© en classe et √† moiti√© dans la cour, afin d'√©viter trop de contacts. De plus, d√®s qu'un √©l√®ve a connu un cas dans son entourage, toute la classe passe √† distance... Mais oui en effet, il s'agit quand m√™me d'un foyer d'√©closion malgr√© les mesures.
Pas vrai.
Les enfants doivent porter des masques dans les corridors ou √† l‚Äôext√©rieur de leur classe.
Source: j‚Äôai un gar√ßon de 6 ans et nous avons re√ßus des consignes de la commission scolaire.
Exacte. Dans les √©coles , les r√©cr√©s se font en groupe-classe et les enfants ont pas vraiment de contactes avec les autres groupes. C'est peut-√™tre pas 100% certain que les enfants croisent pas d'autres enfants dans d'autres groupes, mais entk, a l'√©cole de ma fille, je sais qu'ils sont tr√®s stricte. Il y a eu des cas dans son √©cole, mais jamais ces cas ce sont propag√© dans les autres classes. C'est comme ca depuis le d√©but de l'ann√©e scolaire 2020-2021. Par contre, je parle juste de l'√©cole que je connais...
Je suis prof en stage en Estrie... C' clairement les ecoles
what pisses me off is that they have been saying since September our healthcare system is struggled with all the new hospitlaztions, but the government hasnt actually lifted a finger to do anything about it... like why coudnt we call in the army to help the nurses and doctors like we did for the CHSLDS? Why arent we fast tracking immigration status for people who have previously worked in the medical field to get them a job here asap? raising salaries for nurses so they will be more inclined to stay in the field? literally anything at all?
>The most frustrating part of all this (beyond Legault‚Äôs incompetence, corruption and flagrant conflict of interest) is that we will have learned nothing.  
What corruption and conflict of interest?
I absolutely agree with you on the "we will have learned nothing".
During the first wave, many seniors in CHSLDs died.  We were unprepared, we made mistakes.  Tragic mistakes.  Now we are in the second wave and guess what?  Again lots of seniors in CHSLDs have died.  How are we ok with this as a society?  We, as a rich nation, should be protecting our most vulnerable.   And we know Legault will blame the federal government and Aaron Derfel (of the Gazette), and people vacationing, etc... but the second wave we can blame solidly on this government.
This one wont be over in 12 months.
We still have between 2 to 3 years of this one. Possibly more because the authorities are only trying to slow things down - thus prolong it - and have no plan or strategy how to seek an end to it
C'est pas clair : l'eau mouille, mais est-ce que l'eau elle-m√™me peut √™tre consid√©r√©e mouill√©e ? Je serais pas pr√™t √† dire oui cat√©goriquement.

Underrated
Doctor here who trained in Quebec. Been like that for a long time. Most wait times are about 2 years in Montreal to get a family doctor. 
You can blame the PREM system which is basically that the Quebec government wants to restrict and force doctors to work where there is the highest need. 
Makes sense in theory, terrible in execution.
Essentially what you have to do if you want to practice in Quebec as a Family Doctor is you have to: 
1) get clinic approval to work somewhere, but that alone means nothing.
2) You then apply for a "PREM"  8-10 months in advance to be able to work in that region (can only be done once a year which is insane). You select a few regions you want to work in (presumably ranked from favoured to less favourable). 
3) There is an interview process whereby 2 random doctors or admin staff basically interrogate you for why you are wanting to work in a particular region. This would happen over that useless 8-10 month period, and often you'd have to fly into Montreal for these interviews if you weren't already in town (twiddling your thumbs). 
4) They either accept or refuse your request (I know many Fam Docs who got refused for no apparent reason, even when a clinic already accepted them to work there, and was in need). 
5) If you get accepted to a region, you can pretty much only work in that region. You'd have to apply to work in another spot if you had to move clinics.
If a doctor retires, another new doctor outside of that clinic/region, can't immediately come take over their practice, because that Fam doc has to apply for the nearly year long process and only maybe be given the PREM. So their panel of ~2000 patients is now left without a doctor and if another doc at that clinic isn't willing to take them on, they have no choice but to let those patients go back onto the waitlist to find another family doctor. Cycle continues.
It's a ridiculous system that does nothing to improve access to doctors, and instead pushes new doctors away from being able to practice in Montreal where there is great need.

Edit: Grammar, clarity.
Also, sorry don't have suggestions for finding a family doctor faster apart from what others have mentioned in the chat. It's a really shitty system in Montreal/Quebec unfortunately. If you need something soon, go to a walk in first thing in the AM (and expect to wait still). Good luck.
Call 811, inform them of your situation and needs. And they'll usually point you in the right direction.
Walk-in clinic. But you don't actually walk-in, you call the morning of or the day before for an appointment.
It's very tricky here but this is what I've learned: to see a specialist like a cardiologist, you need a referral first. You can get that referral from any dr at a walk in clinic or your family dr. Obviously you don't have a family doctor or you wouldn't be asking this question. To get an appointment at a walk in clinic, you have a couple options: 
1. You can go on bonjour Santa and pay a small fee for them to find you an appointment. I think 20$. 
2. You can go on rvsq.ca and try to book an appointment there. This will be tricky as often there are few appointments but if you try early in the morning and keep refreshing all day, you might get one. Because of covid,you appointment will likely be telephone at first and the dr will tell you if you need to be seen in person. If so, have that dr help you make an appointment at their clinic in person. 
 3. You can locate specific walkin clinics in your neighborhood and find out what time they open for walk in rendezvous. It's different at each clinic. For example the 2 close to me, one opens at 5 pm the day before and the other at 9pm. The website of the clinic should either have a phone number or place online to make the appointment right there. This is a good option if you want to try to keep all your medical care in one place, and only go to the same clinic for your appointments. But it's not as good an option if you feel like you need to be seen urgently. 
General tip is that it's easier for people within the system (ie drs, secretaries, etc) to make appointments and get around the bureaucracy than it is for the patient him or herself. So if you need to make more appointments, do it with the secretary before you leave, or get help from them.

Bonjour Sant√©. Ca coute 5$ mais t'as un rdv.
If you're having cardiac symptoms you'll get seen by a doctor in the ER, and get blood work and an EKG done pretty quick. I work in the ER, we take cardiac symptoms pretty seriously. If you'd prefer go through the clinic first because you feel like it's not urgent you can always get an appointment online on RVSQ (Rendez Vous Sant√© Quebec).
You don't see a doctor here, you just pay taxes and die
If you're having cardiac issues, go to the emergency department at your local hospital.

do you have work insurance? many benefit packages have Dialogue or similar which allows you to see doctors virtually, right away.
Make an appointment online from the (free) govt website 
https://www.rvsq.gouv.qc.ca/fr/accueil
It's for "walk in clinics", I've never failed to get an appointment at least the next morning if I'm booking the night before. It's effective
When you go to the appointment be clear with the doctor that you would like a referral for a cardiologist. Most doctors will be willing to give you one that easily if you explain your heart situation. That's pretty much it. Once you're in with the specialist they'll follow up with you. Apply for a family doctor in the mean time, but that takes at least a year to get.
Link can be found on the other answer, but you can find walk-in / same or next day consultations here:[https://sante.gouv.qc.ca/en/repertoire-ressources/consultations-medicales-sans-rendez-vous/](https://sante.gouv.qc.ca/en/repertoire-ressources/consultations-medicales-sans-rendez-vous/)
This often requires you do go there early in the morning to reserve a spot for the day.
Otherwise, registering for a family doctor will take months and months before they assign you someone.
I read through the comments and didn‚Äôt find anyone with this tip. If you want to have a family doctor there‚Äôs a much quicker way than putting your name on the government wait list. Google clinics in your area and start calling them up. Ask if any of the doctors are accepting new patients. Rinse and repeat until you find one. You‚Äôll have a better shot with newer clinics/doctors. I found one within a couple of weeks when I took this approach years ago. But even with a family doctor, walk-in clinic is the quickest way to see someone if you have something that‚Äôs not hospital emergency room type situation.
Greater Montr√©al area guy here. I was on the waiting list in 2016 or 2017. But the day I made 45, I had my family doctor. Same with all my friends. Everyone that was on a list (doesn't matter for how long) had a family doctor when they reached 45.
My family doctor (which is only for me, not exactly for the family) works in a modern clinic with very little wait times and a web page appointment service. If I want to see him next week, I just take an appointment on the web page and that's it.
My wife on the other hand, has no luck with her doctor. Hers is old school. Call by phone and see you when I see you. 
And yeah, my kids have another one (not mine and not my wife's). Placed a demand to be transfered to mine but I need both doctors to agree.
Crazy system. And I know crazy systems, I'm from the Balkans.
Tap Medical app has saved me a few times.
https://www.tapmedical.ca/en
Do the emerg thing as said in previous post. Don‚Äôt mess around if it is your heart. Straight to emerg and that is how to see a doctor in Quebec!
I used bonjour-sante for doctor appointments for years
There's an online system to get a family doctor. It will tell you that you will get one in 440 days, but don't worry, it will likely be 500+.
Edit: 1500+ for some apparently.
Take a sharp knife, go to the hospital. As you walk through the ER door, cut your arm so that you will bleed profusely. With any luck, you should see someone relatively quickly (probably before you bleed out).
Find a walk-in or community clinic (or doctor who has some walk-in hours) where you generally feel that they are on the ball and stick with it. Here generally they will start making scheduled appointments when they start investigating things. You want a clinic where the docs are sticking around- it isn‚Äôt just a half-way point to elsewhere. And when you find someone or somewhere stick with them as long as it is working out.  Mine has moved to the other side of the city and I drive all the way out there.
I think walk-ins are a scourge and should be abolished, but patients (not meaning you!) have to stop treating health-care like fast-food, just going anywhere. There has to be a partnership for efficient and comprehensive care.
There is also the gov website to take appointments: [https://www.rvsq.gouv.qc.ca/fr/accueil](https://www.rvsq.gouv.qc.ca/fr/accueil) (it's like bonjour sant√©, but free - however, I never tried it myself, dunno if it is good.)
It depends, are you a Quebec resident? A Canadian citizen?
I registered for a family doctor about 6 months ago and was given a wait time of 917 days.
Another health related problem:  If you are visiting Quebec and need some medical care Quebec is the only province that doesn't have reciprocal agreements with other provinces - so you have to pay and get your money back from your health plan.
&#x200B;
Not really very friendly way for a neighbour to act.
Following this thread because I need to know too.  Lifelong Montreal resident lol.
Have you tried some of these clinics? [https://old.reddit.com/r/montreal/wiki/infores#wiki\_clinics](https://old.reddit.com/r/montreal/wiki/infores#wiki_clinics)
All these people talking about family doctors are being a bit nutso, obviously people see doctors all the time even when they don't have a family doctor.
You can call walk in clinics around you to see what their appointment policy is. As far as I can tell all of the "walk ins" are not actually walk in anymore, you call or go to their website or bonjour sant√© to make an appointment either the day of or the day before.
You can also call 811 and talk to them (which is a truly amazing service that I use all the time and people don't hype up enough) or use https://bonjour-sante.ca/LandingPage/ to make an appointment at a random clinic.
Pay for bonjour sant√© for a few months about 24.95 I think. Cheaper than spending 200$ to see a private doctor. It's not right that the system is broken, but it's such a clusterfuck that it's probably not worth choosing this particular  hill to die on.
Try [rvsq.gouv.qc.ca](https://rvsq.gouv.qc.ca) you can book an appointment with a doctor on there.
Before I had a family doctor, Bonjour-Sant√© always worked for me. BTW, I got my family doctor trough a friend recommendation, not trough the waiting list. Worth mentionning to your new friends from Montreal that you are looking for one.
Not sure why this isn't suggested, but you can book a "walk in" type appointment with a normal GP here: [https://www.rvsq.gouv.qc.ca/](https://www.rvsq.gouv.qc.ca/)
Right now, it's mostly by telephone, so you can basically pick any postal code because it doesn't matter for phone purposes. I have lived in BC and ON previously, and I found that the QC booking system for those without a GP is soooo much better than just going to a random walk-in in the case of more serious health issues (context: I have a few chronic conditions which require monitoring or follow-up during flares). 
Although I think the system is a bit stressed right now, I have never had an issue getting appointments - often possible to get one next day! Wild considering that I was previously used to either a) waiting hours in a walk-in, b) several week wait for appt
Bonjour sant√© is the easiest way. I've had some docs tell me if I see them enough times I could come on as a regular patient (they'd be my GP)
Bonjour-sante or go the emergency at a hospital.
I would go into a walk-in clinic and if anything they will refer you to see a specialist
If you aren't from Quebec, there are walk-in clinics here that can assess you; BUT please check with them/call to see if they take out-of-province Medicare cards in advance. Some do not, it's really irritating. If you ever have to go to the hospital, they for some reason don't seem to understand that out of province people exist here also so you have to be pretty vocal about it. Took me awhile to explain to them I've lived here for 3 years and can't apply for residency as a student hence my NB healthcare card.
Hopefully you find something!
If you feel like you're having symptoms, go to the ER of the hospital you'd like. 
Very good chance you get referred to a specialist there. 
I have a fantastic family doctor but when I had an issue, that's more or less what happened and my care has been fast and incredible.
I've seen numerous specialists, had calls from other specialists to explain certain non-urgent things just so I'm aware, etc. Never waited more than about 3 weeks to see one, had follow ups exactly on schedule.
Honestly very impressive. I've always thought if I had an issue, I would go to a private hospital in another country but I never even considered it through this. 
This was at the CHUM/ St-Denis.
You can go to a CLSC and you will get information. Or walk-in clinic and ask the physician, if necessary, a medical referral to see a specialist.
Impatience in these matters isn't optional. The last resort is the emergency (CHUM Sanguinet offers good service, not to sure about the CUSM Glenn however).
Tia health app is free in Montreal now. I started using it a month ago and have had appointments 3x with the same doctor over the phone (I had to get a referral to a specialist which is in June). They write prescriptions, do referrals, etc. If you have a health card you don't pay anything.
Try a walk in clinic. It‚Äôs extremely hard and frustrating trying to find a doctor in good ole Quebec ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Book an overnight reservation. I believe the new patient is for a family doctor
I moved here a few months ago and have the same question.
I‚Äôm thinking a walk-in?
To register for a family doctor you do it here (might take time but if you have a serious and chronic condition they‚Äôll probably call you sooner than you think https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/finding-a-resource/registering-with-a-family-doctor) 
To make an immediate appt do here, it will be a telemedicine call to start but if you need to be referred to a specialist they can https://www.rvsq.gouv.qc.ca/en/home
And I recently got a family doctor at this clinic; maybe if you call directly they‚Äôll have an opening and can take you https://lacitemedicale.com/
Long story short, don‚Äôt freak out just call around. And in the interim just be your own advocate / history taker (take notes, ask for copies of your tests) so that you can pass through to the next doctor you see 
Good luck!
good question, thanks for aking. I lived here forever and don't know how. Last time I thought it would be a good idea to consult because my gf says I have sleep apnea..  I tried my local clinic's website and app and it just didn't work. I abandonned after fucking around for half an hour. I'm going to give clic sant√© a try.
Walk in clinic is the easiest way to see a Dr. Even if it's just a student it's easiest to go that route
Socialized medicine not all it‚Äôs cracked up to be.
Use bonjour-sant√© online to secure an appointment with a doctor in a clinic locally, you can get referals from them to see specialists as well. If you have insurance you can contact a private clinic. Also get on the waitlist for a family doc. Good luck
Go to a clinic. You will need to pay (cash) $47.50 for the visit with the doctor who is on call "medecin de garde". Then wait in the waiting room for the doctor to call you into their office.
I had an emergency while in Montreal a few weeks ago, and could not sign up for the clinic online because I'm not living in Quebec at the moment. I showed up first thing in the morning at the walk-in clinic, and stated my symptoms. I had to pay cash to see the doctor, but I did see one after less than an hour's wait. It was quick, efficient, I got a prescription and was treated.
Honestly, I'm in the same boat. Been waiting 2 years for a family doctor now. If you can afford it and your issue is urgent/worrisome, I recommend seeing a family doctor at Rockland MD (the one on Rockland Road) in order to get relatively quick treatment. Saw a specialist there last year and a family doctor this year, and it was better than any public health service I've received to date. It sucks to have to pay in a system of supposedly universal healthcare, but it's that or wait forever...
Cardiogenics. Private clinic if you can afford it, but hecka of a good service.
Hello. I did this recently as someone who does not have a family doctor. System is a bit strange but is easy to use once you understand. I had an appointment within a day and in person within a week. **you must register online and you should be able to get an appointment the next day**. 
If it's covid related and you need assistance ER. Otherwise you must book an appointment online with a general practitioner, all walk in clinics are reservation only. The doctor may simply do an online/phone consultation and then refer you to a specialist for in person check up.
The government site is https://rvsq.qouv.qc.cq alternatively for a small fee you may sign up for https://bonjour-sante.ca which is basically the same type of thing but has different listing of clinics. These are all still public clinics but different cliniques use one platform or the other. Bonjour Sant√© is overall a better more functional service than the government's I used it. 
**Important: you just keep checking these websites multiple times a day if you go now you'll likely see nothing**. The clinics each post their availability for next day appointments only starting at the end of the day and all at different hourly increments starting AFAIK as early as 4:00 PM. **You must therefore check the site exactly at 4:00 PM, then 5:00 PM, 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 8:00 PM. Expect appointments to only remain listed for a maximum of 30 minutes** before having to wait for the next hourly increment. For example a clinic in one location may update their bookings every day at 4:00 PM where as a different clinic updates it every day at 6:00 PM.
Checking at hourly increments you should hopefully still be able to get an appointment in one or two days.
If it cannot wait 1 or 2 days or few days more for referral then call 811 for minor emergency or go to the ER.
Speeding in downtown Montreal is physically impossible during daylight hours. Maybe at 4 am‚Ä¶
Who owns all these fancy cars that keep showing up in the old Port? A black Ferrari with the plate CYPHER comes to mind..
Is it me, or is every 10th car suddenly a 2010 Ford Escape these days?
Imagine if the Hulk Transformer makes a cameo in the movie they're shooting!
*Proceeds crashing to Chitauri Leviathan*
Some surprisingly manage to speed on a short stretch that's just one block long (like one block uphill on Cresecent in downtown) or on a cul-de-sac I live in - while obviously ignoring the chance that they hit a kid here. :P
GTR won't be getting any trophy at red light drag racing against some tuned up awd performance cars... just keep rolling normally will tune more heads than doing hooligans on public street...
the other day I spotted a Benz with a plate reads DOOQ or some shit it was unreal
Moi aussi j'aime √ßa mettre 3 ans de salaire dans une voiture puis √™tre pogn√© dans le traffic comme tout le monde anyways :P
what's that car? NIO?
Not the most "Hulk" car i've ever seen.
Definitely the ugliest paint job on a Mercedes I've ever seen.
Can confirm, live on Parc
0-100 in 3seconds speedong is totally an option for him
You got to be kidding Robert Bourassa just south of this picture is VERY wide and you can get triple digit speed very easily.
Can confirm. 
I live in Griffintown and Bassins is right outside my balcony. It‚Äôs not uncommon to hear Lamborghinis and Ferraris driving up and down the street way past the 30 speed limit after midnight.
When I was young and still in university, some Arab kid in one of my class lived at the Ritz-carlton and drove his red Ferrari 4 blocks to McGill university.
Just saw the CYPHER car, girl driving.
Il n'y a pas de circulation de voitures dans le vieux port.... Pas trop sur de quoi tu parles.
[deleted]
My question is why would you flex on a car like this in Montreal with all the people running red lights? Literally takes one mistake and the damage to your car is probably worth the value of the other guy's entire car. Sick vanity plate though.
Yeah!! I used to onlg see them on tv plugs. Guess they sold them off to the public
You need an SUV to drive on Montreal roads with any kind of comfort.
le gars fais peut etre ca 3 semaines...
mercedes AMG gtR
Cest une amg gtr je crois alors.. cest un spec dorigine
That's the stock amg green
I find it hilarious when they start a race corner Milton/Parc and theres suddenly 3 cops just right there they didnt see...
I can see that street corner from my apartment, this happens almost every night at least once/
More 0 in 0 if he's downtown
Just because dudes love flooring 500whp+ vehicles in the city doesn't mean it's an option lol. You either learn that early on or end up as a clip in the supercrar crash compilations on YouTube üíØ.
That is a beautiful juxtaposition of the old and new indeed. All the best with your hunt!
You know, most people don‚Äôt get into accidents every day, right?
More like, the potholes.
So you would be the garage showcar type of guy, that's fine but id rather drive it as much as possible. Also insurance.
oh! ok thx
Robert Bourrassa is VERY wide and you can easily get triple digit speed just a bit south of this picture, also 720 is downtown and i bet that AMG can get 200+ in there.
Ok we won‚Äôt get into the specifics about how a 500whp transforms the linear power from the pistons to rotational power, calculate the michelin super sport friction coefficient against the Montreal pavement and find if it accelerates fast enough.
It just can.
720 is a bit fucked up right now. With how hard the suspension is in that car you'll probably shoot out of the roof if you go 200 in that thing.
everyone can nail the jump from the light until they can't. We all think the rear wheel won't break loose. We are all wrong.
This is not a car forum. But your arguments don‚Äôt really make sense. I could just counter that the limit there is 50.. and if you speed up at 80 between two blocks‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre technically already speeding. So, the question was, can you do speeding in downtown. Answer is Yes. 
No hard feelings.
You're supposed to take pictures and shame them on social media. It's the closest thing we have to justice now.
The other day I saw 3 police cars do a u-turn on Avenue du parc when there's a sign telling you not to. It's kinda dangerous because when you're the 3rd car, you probably feel peer pressured to go for it even tho you're getting short on time.
Another time, a police car didn't stop when I was looking to cross on a yellow pedetrian cross walk.
Shame.
Not just "technically". They recently arrested someone for biking on the sidewalk. The reality is that the police consider themselves to be above traffic laws.
If you‚Äôre walking, and need money... throw yourself in front of them and then sue. 
There is no justice, only settlements.
Police are above the law in Canada and we have no one to call to stop them.
Choose your battles. This is not worth fighting for.
I mean, I only care if I get ticketed for doing the same. 
And if they actually nearly run me over or something.. But otherwise, this isn't a problem.
Because they have the power to ticket/arrest/beat/kill you and you don't have the same power over them.
>So why should we?
Because every idiot who justifies breaking laws for this reason encourages another idiot to do the same?
Bruh y'all never bike and it shows. Sometimes it's safest or the best way to hop on the sidewalk for a bit. Of course I always slow down to walking speed if there are pedestrians, but there's no danger.  
And I appreciate when a police officer sees me not being a problem and simply ignores me when I do it. I see no problem in giving them the same respect.
rules for thee but not for me
I treat cops as parking managers as thats all I see em do
They do it all the time on Prince-Arthur, a pedestrian street, where cyclists regularly get tickets for not walking their bike.
I mean I live in Lasalle, and every day... people, their families, police you name it, they're all on bikes and they're all on the side walks at one point or another... Why are you so bent out of shape over your experience with the police today?
It's a dangerous street. Sometime is safer to cycle on the sidewalk at a slow reasonable speed.
I myself use the sidewalks once in a while on dangerous streets like on some spot of atwater near the market.
Safety first!
Were they biking fast? Were there a lot of people around?
they are cadets patrolling the area. while on the job they can use sidewalk. 
why you flagged them? sounds to me you just like to disturb the shit.
I used to hate cops for everything and would get in their face when I saw them breaking laws and I still think we should re-purpose and disarm them. Anyway, with age I try and give everyone the benefit of the doubt as long as they aren't being an ass and it's made my life a lot more enjoyable, do what you want, I had to get that out there :) Oh yea, as to your question, I think we shouldn't blindly obey laws and the cops do give this example but it's also the cops job to give us tickets, otherwise they lose their jobs...
Im sure there's a lot more context to this, if their cadets their likely patrolling around parks so you'll see them come on and off the street. Their just doing their job and their cadets so their still learning
They are special they are just like emergency vehicles‚Ä¶ i suppose without sirens üö®
I think I saw them too but it was on Jolicoeur. They were waiting to cross la verendrye on wrong side of road too. Must be the same cops lol
Fuck me hey. The other day I saw a police office carrying a firearm. In public on their belt... #Shocked Face Here I am seeing the police officer do something a regular citizen can‚Äôt.
I‚Äôm shocked and need to voice my concern to everybody else who is also #Shocked and probably also offended that someone would put them in such a dangerous position. 
*Shocked Face*
Guys, let's focus our outrage on something more productive.
Police don't make the dumb laws; bureaucrats do. I've literally never been stopped or warned or fined for biking on the side walk. Ofc when there's no bike path, and not flying past people walking.
Deflate the police
Saw a police motorcycle on a bike path on de Maisonneuve yesterday
I've seen many times SPVM agents being idiotically sarcastic (or trying to, as they usually aren't smart enough to do good sarcarsm) when faced to a question like that. They just do not care. Once I was crossing a 10km/h street in the pedestrian lane and almost got hit by their car, which was running slow but didn't care to stop. A "hey, there's priority here" was answered by a loud laugh by one of them.
The SPVM is the worst police corp that I got to know in life. I try to imagine what kind of formation they have to become such assholes against the public they're supposed to serve.
> Our police can't even follow the laws  
Yep, sometimes they don't even know the law, and when they do they think it does not apply to them even in non-emergency situations.
üò±
I was sitting in my car parked roughly 3 car lengths from a mall entrance door,waiting for someone,car running in the winter.Cop tells me to move or I‚Äôll get a ticket for illegally stopping in the fire lane.I told him ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just picking someone up,it won‚Äôt even be 5 mins and plus the sign says no parking,not no stopping!‚Äù..says ‚Äú move now smart ass‚Äù.So I move into a legal parking spot.As I leave and drive around the mall parking lot past the next entrance door,the asshole left his cruiser parked dead center blocking the sidewalk handicap ramp.
On the topic of police, anyone have a clue why there were more than a thousand police with a dozen paddywagons in the Concordia area on Saturday?
One must break laws to enforce laws!
This is unfortunately how our system has been designed!
I read cycling as crying for some reason
That's what happens when police are held lesser standard. When in fact, they should be held to higher standards in front of the law. Because not only do they represent the law, but they also should know it better.
Doesn't make sense that civilians are held to higher standards, when we don't represent the law, don't enforce it and don't know it as well.
Don't understand why our so called modern state doesn't have an anti police squad yet. They should take care of the complaints and have the authority to arrest officers and give them fines as well. In other words, treat the police just like they treat us.
Cycling on the sidewalk is such a pet peeve of mine.
Get on the road.
in their minds, these laws don't apply to them bcuz they think they are the law.
Cops do this all the time! They turn on their lights, perform an illegal move like run a red light or do an illegal u turn, then turn off their lights and drive off normally.
I've almost been hit in crosswalks by cops. My fault though! Seeing a cop approaching a crosswalk and expecting them to follow the rules!
Not just traffic laws, all laws. And, they are. Who‚Äôs going to ticket or arrest them?
My husband got a ticket 2 summers ago for biking on the sidewalk on Langelier near highway 40 (if you‚Äôre not familiar, it‚Äôs a super busy intersection/area)
unfortunately this isn't america, individual settlements are capped around 100k in canada (someone correct me if i'm wrong) . Which basically means even if someone hits you with a car and makes your quadraplegic the most they can be legally sued for is 100k. If you're gonna nosedive for money better not make it here, it's hardly worth it.
You specify "in Canada," I wonder if you know of a country where the police are not above the law and there is someone to call? Genuinely curious.
Technically, the CRCC which is an independent agency is supposed to police the police and the RCMP. Not sure how it works though. I just passed my citizenship exam so had to learn a couple of things lol.
I said nothing about fighting. And I also assume you've never been an elderly person/ child walking down a narrow sidewalk when a cyclist just about knocks you over.
They do ticket people for doing the same.
Yeah, why complain that cops aren‚Äôt being stricter lmao
they dont, theyre cadets
Technically civilians *can* legally detain cops if they see them breaking the law until other cops come to arrest them. Good luck with that though. They'll just shoot you, gang beat up your corpse, sue your family for the stains your blood did to their uniform and get a freaking medal for heroism.
The conservative mantra !
glorified revenue collectors for the state
That's top-notch. You should brand this.
Legit would buy
Just not Gildan, fait le avec "c'est beau" pour un produit local
The nail‚Ä¶. It has been hit on the head.
C'est du beau boulot, si tu peux en produire quelques centaines, tu peux appliquer sur l'appel d'offre de la ville pour des EPI!
id buy one
Love this and would buy! Keep us posted if you decide to sell :)
Ooh nice follow-up! Thought this was just for a Halloween costume before :)
If you do more tests, consider making the logo in white (like a negative on the orange space for example)?
You should make matching pants :)
I love this. I would absolutely purchase this T shirt! üòÅ
That‚Äôs brilliant! I‚Äôd buy that in a heart beat!
Jesus would wear this.
On va te confondre avec un c√¥ne orange dans la rue!
That's a really good but I wouldn't even know where to start. I'll do some research, thanks
I prefer Kirkland brand T shirts but the Gildans are good for trying stuff out that might fail. If I ever sell these I would use Kirkland.
Moi aussi
Good idea. I'll try that
Clown pants like the cops a little while ago‚Ä¶
Ton T-shirt devrait √™tre en vente dans la boutique de [Ponto](https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://minyaka.com/ponto/&ved=2ahUKEwjh2YbAjpH0AhXpRt8KHQ0_A20QFnoECA0QAQ&usg=AOvVaw2VYTPgzfn9E3nDZDO1nOSf)
I mean, in a way you‚Äôre buying local‚Ä¶Gildan‚Äôs head office is in Montreal!
I asked Ponto. Ponto said "no". :(
Ye mais c'est beau la prod, le t shirt et les byreaux sont icitte
I felt more the way you do when their manufacturing was still in Montreal. They've lost a bit - but thankfully not all - of their appeal to me.
Put it on RedBubble and/or etsy. I'd buy one!

C'est joli. merci. √áa arrive souvent que le ciel est d'un orange bien uni comme √ßa dans ce coin?
That‚Äôs an a350 on approach to YUL there!
edit: I was wrong, it's an A330!
nice pic, and you caught the airplane in the photo. üëçüëçüëç actually, not nice, but great pic!
planet Arrakis, can't wait for Denis Villeneuve's Dune, soon this fall.
./.  Z
Oui, c'√©tait un beau coucher de soleil, mais tr√®a ordinaire, typique du mois de juin. Puis, comme j'ai zoom√© pas mal, on ne voit pas le d√©grad√© vers le rose, plus haut.
Close!  It's actually a 777, you can tell by the nose :)
I bet that plane flew over my place in park-ex!
I don‚Äôt think it is, look at the main landing gear, seems to only have 8 wheels and not the 12 of a triple 7. It also has winglets, which triple 7s don‚Äôt have. Im now more inclined to say it‚Äôs an a330 though now looking at the nose.
Ah good catch; I didn't zoom in on the landing gear, I was just going by the overall pointed profile which usually says "Boeing aircraft", but it could be an A330.  Either that or a 767.
The winglets on the A330 are pretty low profile too, which the aircraft in this picture seems to be.  Further research required!
Edit:
Upon closer inspection, it appears to be a 767.  The landing gear appear to be tilted forward instead of tilted backwards, which unless we get a good look at the windows, is one of the key differences between an A330 and a 767.
https://www.airlinerspotter.com/images/airliner-spotting-charts/boeing-767-airbus-a330-spotting-guide.jpg
Zoom in pal, the wheels are indeed tilted forward like those on an A330 and it has that slight nose up approach angle, plus I do not believe there are any current 767 with winglet operators to YUL. Before COVID, OS used to operate a daily flight but they stopped at the beginning of the pandemic. Also, we have several A330 operators to Montreal, Air Canada, Air Transat, Tunisair, Air Alg√©rie and Lufthansa off the top of my head. So it seems like it is much more likely to be an A330
You just contradicted yourself.
You observed that the wheels are tilted forward, but that's not how an A330 is configured.  The wheels are tilted backwards in an A330.
That's a 767.
When I say tilted forward, I mean that the rear wheel is lower than the front, if it is a 767 who is operating it?
It's an A330
That is not what is displayed in the picture.  The rear wheels are higher than the front on the main landing gear.
Not only that, but your observation about a "nose-up approach angle" is also incorrect:
[https://imgur.com/sWqeygn](https://imgur.com/sWqeygn)
That is NOT a nose-up approach angle.
Judging by the livery I would guess that this is a FedEx or UPS 767F, both which DO service CYUL.
Neither of those companies operate into YUL, they both operate into YMX and neither of them operate 767s with winglets.
 It is 100% an A330.
Looking here: [https://www.flightradar24.com/airport/yul/arrivals](https://www.flightradar24.com/airport/yul/arrivals)
I cannot find any 767 arrivals, but there are at least 10 A330 arrivals in the past 48 hours. 
Looking at the arrival schedule last night and with the sun setting at approximately 8:45 PM last night, there is flight AC306, an airbus A330 which landed at YUL at 8:44PM last night and taxied to the gate at 9 PM.
So you're just going to ignore that you've made a host of incorrect observations.
Even these 'winglets' you are talking about are possibly little more than photographic artifacting.  There's not much to them. 
So let's recap:
You claimed at first that it was an A350 - that was determined to be incorrect.
Then you yourself pointed out that the landing gear was tilted in the wrong direction for it to be an A330.
You also claimed that it had a "nose-up approach angle" which anyone with a *ruler* can see is wrong.
You're trying frantically to prove some level of competency that I'm just not seeing here.  
You have only been right about one thing: it's not a 777.
La photo a √©t√© prise vers 20h40, en effet, et √ßa ressemble pas mal √† un A330.
Une autre histoire r√©glable avec des cam√©ras corporelles pour les policiers
I work in banking and I GUARANTEE clients say worse things to me all the time... but I don't get bent out of shape, track them down, and bust into their home like the Kool-Ade Man to whup their asses. The "thin blue line" should be renamed to the "thin-skinned blue line".
All I know is what's in the article. But I do know something else... I live across the street from an expensive, and very big, daycare center, and some parents simply don't give a shit about parking rules because "it's only 2 minutes". My driveway is always blocked by some entitled asshole. I've tried telling them nicely, they don't care. I tried telling them a little more forcefully, they get even more mad at me. I've tried talking to the daycare administration, they act all apologetic but nothing happens.
Coincidentally, this morning it happened again and I called the city to tow or at least ticket their asses. I've spoken to my neighbors and we all have the same problem. It's a one lane, one way street, with a bike path. The chaos at 3 p.m. is ridiculous.
To reiterate, these people dropping off their kids do not care at all. That being said, to have police enter your house and tackle you over a parking fine is beyond ridiculous as well, but the way humans are in general, both civilian and law enforcement, it doesn't surprise me that a situation would degenerate to this point.
This is what happens when cops are untouchable in Montreal. Is the guy a jerk? Yes but those public security officers are asshats as well. This is precisely why you need security cameras to a cloud in and outside of your home
Who cares que c'est un docteur? C'est pour lui donner de la cr√©dibilit√©?
Obstruction of justice. Nothing more than a bullsh*t power trip tactic on the part of police to charge/arrest anyone who dares to argue with or question them.
It's fine, we have 7 cops walking the streets to connect with people on some pilot that's going to be cancelled next year. We're good here.
I don't understand the psychology here: they're acting all tough beating up people for no reason, but at the same time they're little pussies who feel "threatened" by any random word or "fear for their life" when a scrawny unarmed homeless person charges at them.
Tout le monde ici croit vraiement que les policiers se sont rendus chez l'homme trois heures apr√®s l'altercation avec un agent de s√©curit√© juste parce qu'il a  dit"Go ahead" quand on l'a mena√ß√© de le remorquer?  Come on.  Le policiers sont pas des saints, loin de l√†, surtout ceux de Montr√©al.  Mais il manque clairement la version de l'agent de s√©curit√© ici.  Il s'est certainement dit quelque chose de moins anodin que "Go ahead" pour que les policiers se pr√©sentent chez lui.
Question technique, est-ce que la s√©curit√© publique de Ville Mont Royal ce sont des agents de la paix?
acab here, acab everywhere. 
Give angry and violent men weapons and power, and let them handle minor altercations, good idea‚Ä¶ /s
devastating trauma for the cops, better give them another 300 million $ for some reason
Point gagnant pour les candidats.. fucking bodycams, now!
ACAB
Woa did he really dare the police?
The guys was a dick to the security guard no doubt but the security guard and the police overreacted in a criminal manner.  Disgraceful.
ACAB
J'aimerais tellement savoir si c'√©tait parfaitement gratuit, ou si c'√©tait apr√®s que les policiers lui ont demand√© 150 fois de faire quelque chose ou si c'est quelque part entre les deux?
Vivement les bodycams!!
A crime is a crime. 
I think he should be at least sentenced to three years of labor concentration camp in Yukon. 
Then after his last supper, he can choose between Lethal Injection, Electrocution, Lethal Gas, Firing Squad, or Hanging
These cops are a great example of the ACAB syndrome
So another one sided story?
Nobody's said it yet but I will, This would not have happened if this man wasn't an immigrant.
Yeah because they mistook him for the professor's brother, in money heist
J'√©coutais Nantel hier et je pense que MA Cyr trouverait que c'est une bonne chose.
Wait.  Je viens de lire l'article et peut √™tre qu'il trouverait que c'est inadmissible, √† cause du nom de famille.
D'un autre c√¥t√© les m√©decins sont riches alors il trouverait probablement que √ßest bien correct.  Et m√™me bien.
C'est un progressiste. Il choisit ses combats...
"he at first said he‚Äôd just stay in the spot, since he‚Äôd already been ticketed"
Yeah, no buddy - that's not how it works. I find it infuriating these entitled assholes feel that they're entitled to continue to illegal park when 1. they stay in the car 2. they've already received a ticket. No, none of these give you the right to park.
But wow. The rest of the account is pretty horrifying and really hope that the police will be held accountable. Something does not add up. My gut tells me that he did assault the security officer, but I could be wrong. What could trigger a security officer to go through all that trouble?
J'ai l'impression qu'avec la flamb√©e de violence √† Montr√©al, il y a beaucoup de policiers qui ne se sentent pas en s√©curit√© et qui vont donc avoir de plus en plus recours √† des tactiques de gangster pour asseoir leur autorit√©. Par exemple, faire preuve d'une violence d√©mesur√©e face √† toute personne qui oserait d√©fier un membre de leur gang.
i find his story hard to believe
the notion of the police invading his house and assaulting him and his spouse, sounds implausible
people who don't like the police will want to believe it though
Attaran?
Tu vois ben que m docteur se croit au dessus des lois. Il re√ßoit un constat d‚Äôinfraction pour √™tre stationn√© la ou il peut pas, se fait demander de bouger son v√©hicule mais agis comme un con et refuse car il a d√©j√† re√ßu un ticket, se fait dire que le v√©hicule sera alors remorqu√©, donne une r√©plique aggressive et condescendante puis va se stationner un peu plus loin ou c‚Äôest aussi interdit. Ya tu lanc√© une menace plus s√©rieuse dans cet √©change?
√áa n‚Äôexcuse en rien l‚Äôop√©ration polici√®re chez le docteur, mais ts√© y‚Äôa pas un proverbe genre qui s√®me, r√©colte?
Tellement!
Je proposerais bien :
Bodycam obligatoire.
Et tant qu'√† y √™tre, enlever les agents qui font du radar et remplacer par ... Des radars.
Il me semble que c'est cher payer 1 ou 2 argents pour cette t√¢che brainless.
thin blue skin?
Used to work at a bank and I was threatened by junkies on my first day can confirm
> My driveway is always blocked by some entitled asshole.
I had the same problem at work with a day care. Every morning someone was in my spot dropping off their kid. Clearly marked REVERVE sign. There's a 15 minute spot for drop offs right in front they NEVER use. (It's always the expensive cars too) 
I used to wait for them. Sometimes it was 20 minutes. I'd get SO mad! Even more agree when I confronted them they didn't care or just said "Relax. It's just 2 minutes".
Anyway, I started blocking them in and leaving a note on their car with the phone number to call me. The rage when I told them it would be "just 2 minutes"... was glorious. They haven't done it in couple years now.
Brutal. I would do the same thing as you... no point in being nice to people in this situation. 
FWIW, I run/bike a lot and by far the scariest place to go by is a daycare/elementary school at open/close. People drive like absolute sociopaths. I don't know what it is, I guess people get weird tunnel vision when it's something to do with their kid and they go "f\*ck everyone else." Many are distracted, but many will also look me in the eye while doing something that puts me at risk. 
[This isn't just anecdotal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214367X16301041?casa_token=5tmxPHgq554AAAAA:fIYTVsFt0F_7xhyClGSzaoJYzIMMudkBFZjjG9hmIuBVk_xIVmWuRWlATc1kYfR8xnHvGWontA), school drop off/pick up zones are one of the most common sites of fatal car-human incidents for children. Ironic since many people drive their kids to school/daycare because they feel that walking or biking is "too dangerous." To make matters worse, now that SUVs are more popular, you are more likely to be killed if you are struck by a car, especially if you are smaller like a child.
Ya and the assholes running into the SAQ for ‚Äú2 minutes‚Äù take the only 2 parking spots clearly marked reserved for daycare every day. People are assholes about parking, it doesn‚Äôt matter what you are doing.
My daycare sent out a letter a few years back after complaints from neighbours that parents were blocking their driveways. It hasn't happened again. Now we just park on the yellow corners. Lol
So I have a question? How would you solve this issue? People have to get their kids and it looks like their isn‚Äôt anywhere for them to park.
If you bought a house beside a golf course, would you get all mad because you had some golf balls in your backyard?
Because our society is classist af and judges the credibility of civilians' interactions with the police upon their position in society.
Pas le choix de mettre une designation positive pour un resident de TMR.
Oui, les medicins comme les ing√©nieurs, les avocats, les plombiers, ou comptables entre autres, sont membre d'un ordre et ils ont un licence et des obligations d'√©thique et de comportement. Qui dans la r√©alit√© ne veut dire beaucoup, mais quand m√™me.
Surprised there was no race card played.
He didn't even argue with police, be argued with a civilian TMR employee.
Dr's generally have friends who are good defense lawyers or a neighbor. I'm going to laugh when the city ends up having to pay him 40-50k
Yeah dude, that's a pillar of fascistic behavior - they're the supermen of humanity and so strong, yet they're also somehow beset on all sides by a credible enemy who threatens their very existence. 
It's why so many cops and fascists are cry bullies
I have lived here all my life and this is a very believable story. Cops in this city have an ego the size of the Bell Center and they have been getting away with worse than this for years.
Absolument. On est suppos√© croire √† la lettre le m√©decin qui se croit en droit de faire ce qu'il veut et d'envoyer promener l'agent de la paix? Ils doivent se faire insulter la journ√©e longue, si √ßa a m√©rit√© un suivi dans ce cos c'est probablement qu'il s'est dit quelque chose de grave.
Non, tout comme ceux du west island. SQ et SPVM sont les seuls policier qui ont juridiction dans Montr√©al.  SQ a une juridiction un peu limit√©e si je me trompe pas
Municipal public security agents are authorized to make arrests (and to use force, but they do not carry guns).
Oui:

Awesome painting! I thought that the apparent structural steel currently visible on the exterior was part of the original Forum design, but now thanks to your painting I see that this was not the case during its glory days. Much nicer the way it was...
I paint in both but I prefer acrylic because it dries faster and does not have an odour.
They both have their difficulties, depends what you‚Äôre painting
Thank you so very much!

Jpas mal sur que bin des LGB aimeraient ravoir leurs parade au lieu d'√™tre mixer avec 40 autres groupes qui ont rien √† voir avec leurs orientation sexuelles... le drapeau arc-en-ciel est de plus en plus cach√© par toute le reste, ca en est s√©rieusement ridicule, c'est pas de l'inclusion c'est lit√©ralement de l'appropriation d'un symbole rendu l√†. Jpas un gros fan surtout que les additions des derni√®res ann√©es sous le chapeau de "l'inclusion" sont arbitraire en tabarnak..
I remember pride in 2007 was starting the same weekend Montreal hosted a(and the only one) Nascar race at Gilles Villeneuve üòÖ
Cos (((LGBTQIA+)^3)/2.5)
I remember back in 1987 or '88 watching near Berri metro station a few dozen guys  walking beside their bicycles down St-Catherine. Two or three of them holding signs. I'm pretty sure that was the first one.

It feels like that acronym just gets longer and longer every time I see it. I'm guessing the + symbol means there are others not mentioned in the acronym itself.

[Why does Montreal host pride events in August?](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-pride-august-1.4782548)
Pride celebrations don't take place all in that month everywhere. In Montreal, our events to celebrate Pride are in August.
Pride is in August in Canada. Always has been, its when the riots happened here. June Pride is American Pride month.
perso je le vois comme une opportunit√©: les gens c√©l√®brent dans leur ''patelin'' pendant le mois de la fiert√© et viennent √† Montr√©al pour la c√©l√©bration en fin d'√©t√©!
Je crois que c'est pour √ßa qu'il y a un + a la fin. C'est comme "ugh ok et tous les autres".
Ouais
It's getting a bit much lol
Personally, I've always preferred [**SGM**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT#SGM/GSM).  It's a much more efficient alternative.

I got nothing against the parade but your argument is silly, it's like saying : "If you dont like KKK parades, no problem, shut the fuck up.and stah home - easy!" üòÇ
En exterieur le risque est moins grand. Au pire, parade avec 2m de distance entre tout le monde.

Basically lol! They also call themselves a community instead of people for some odd reason... ü§î
The way you make friends in Montreal is the same way you make friends anywhere in the world. Consistency is all that matters.
The reason it is so easy to make friends in your youth is because we show up to school and extracurriculars on a regular basis. (It sounds like you already do this with rock climbing) Showing up regularly does 2 things:
1. The strangers around you become familiar to you in that space.
2. You become familiar to the strangers around you in that space
Without knowing it the mind builds trust with these people and the space around it. This is a crucial prerequisite for the final and hardest step, making a move.
Eventually you have to bite your tongue and ask a question, or tell a joke, or complement the individual, or offer something, or let them know they seem cool and you want to get to know them better.
They are bound to be friendly and if not you don't want that sort of individual as a friend anyways. Keep your head up, you got this!
J'ai toujours trouv√© que la meilleure fa√ßon c'est amis d'amis : tu tag Along dans les partys o√π tu connais juste une personne et tu rencontre des gens!
I've met a ton of people through various boardgaming / wargaming groups in Mtl. Quite often, people you meet at an event (gaming caf√©, game store) will later invite you to their home for gaming evenings with friends, where you get to meet more people.
Of course, most of that disappeared with the pandemic...
Want to make friends? Go to a place regularly: club, bar, gym and talk to people, be constant and you'll make some guaranteed
have kids and be forced to mingle with other parents at the park daily üòÇ
I took a few group classes for things that interested me. Met a bunch of people with the same interests as me. I made a point of asking if they'd like to grab a bite/coffee/beer after class. Some of those people are still my friends after 20+ years
I heard that Bumble (the dating app) has a Friends feature! It may sound odd at first, but I have a sibling who tried it when moving to a new city and apparently it‚Äôs a good way to initiate a first contact with potential friends. Maybe look into that, good luck!
Go to bouldering gyms and talk to people there.
Your hobby is the way forward.
Softball. Super chill, social sport.
I(27f) moved to Montreal from Utah(no I'm not a Mormon) earlier this year. looking for friends to hang out with too! Dm's are open and snapchat is on my page. I look forward to hearing from people!
Don't be afraid to talk with strangers. I've made a lot of friends this way. Follow-up with them. Be consistent in their lives
Make friends with your friend's friends. You have a lot in common with your friends, and by extension, their friends too.
My philosophy is:
Make quality friends. You are who you make friends with. Don't settle for sub par people, and you yourself won't be sub-par, and thus, will be more enjoyable to hang around with. There's a ton of quality people out there.
I‚Äôm in the same boat, looking to make friends. Moved to Montr√©al just before the pandemic and finally exploring activities where I can connect with mindful people. I use the meetup app- it‚Äôs great to meet people with different interests.
Very much looking to explore climbing, could use a mentor to accelerate the learning curve. I‚Äôve been following bloc shop and shakti but haven‚Äôt booked a session yet.
* Find activities you like that involve other people.
* Go regularly, consistently, for a long time.
[deleted]
Hey I boulder and sport climb regularly as well, we should team up some day!  
What gym do you usually go to? Before the pandemic I was a regular at Shakti, now I've been going to Nomad Bloc
I didn‚Äôt.
Hey! I‚Äôm a 25 years old guy working in marketing, moving to MTL in two weeks. Would love to learn about what you do since I‚Äôve been thinking about exploring some independent projects as well.
On a emm√©nag√© √† Montr√©al en Octobre.  
D'abord √† Ahuntsic, o√π j'ai pas du tout aim√© la vie de quartier.  
Et nous venons de d√©m√©nager √† deux pas du canal Lachine et de Atwater.  
Clairement le covid nous a emp√™ch√© de faire la moindre rencontre. 0 activit√© et pas moyen de partager des hobbies / passions.  
Aujourd'hui le nouveau quartier me donne l'impression de revivre!  
Mais pour autant, toujours pas de bars ou autre pour faire des rencontres...

As a socially anxious person, I forced my self to work in a busy place in customer service, even when i did not need the money and the work was a bit tiring, I became more comfortable around people and made tons of friends from customers and coworkers, I still work there part time for the same reason, eventhough i have another better paying job that is also part time (also french is a huge factor)
Volunteer somewhere. Could be a soup kitchen, a museum, garden club, a church, literacy - you name it.
I would literally join random groups around mont royal and ask to hang out. I still have really close friends from that
If you'd like you are more than welcome to join the discord server I created to help make friends in Montreal. Started it at the beginning of the pandemic and its been great so far.
You can try the Meetup app, there are a lot of groups on there!
Two sports that were great for me for meeting people were beer-league hockey and competitive squash.  Hockey has a tradition of a sitting around with a beer after the game and the Montreal squash league actually used to have a rule that the home team had to take the away team out for a beer after the game.  I met so many people, many of whom have become good friends, through both.
You talk. you talk the shit out of another person and adopt them if you're an extrovert. but if you're an introvert, wait for some extrovert to adopt you.
where do you live in Montreal?
School, work, and people I knew from high school. I‚Äôm 29 and I feel you, it‚Äôs hard.
We live in the digital world now. Friends are so 2006
Workplace, common interest groups, being a good communicator (French is essential).
i recommend going to Occupy The Hood events.
queer safe space & black empowerment. great place to meet a diverse group of people.
I asked for someone to play Battletoads with me until I met u/_not_reasonable_

This thread is giving better advice for making friends than any rescource you can find online lmao
Reddit, and it was unexpected. I moved to Montreal last year and all my friends from this area I have met through Reddit and a few through dating apps. Also, it was not from the Montreal sub, but more specific to my hobbies.
Montreal is one city where people have cliques and have long-term friends from Cegep and seem not to allow new people into their respective groups.  
I found it easier to make friends in Vancouver and Edmonton, and Windsor than Montreal for some strange reason.  
Anyhow, the advice given here is very much the best in simply finding an area of interest and meeting people.  
Also, another observation is that I have found people a bit less friendly at times, but that may be the sign of changing times.
Ild suggest the following: 1- try learning a lil french here and there because thats the reality in which you're living, 2- go to bars and sit at the bar, you'll be able to chat with the person working there and also with the people sitting next to you, I suggest going to a place where they have happy hours (called "5 √† 7" in french). Usually you'll have a good majority of regulars that will go there and when you become a regular yourself, you'll be more incline to speak with familiar faces, 3- join a sport league either street hockey, baseball, football... they oftenly need someone to join in and you'll not only have all the chances in the world to make new friends there but also it will be a neat access to learning french quickly, 4- dungeons and dragons groups are majorly bilingual in Quebec so you'ld fit right in, 5- volonteering puts you in contact with organisms that are not too picky because they really need hands and plenty of people to talk to, 5- your neighboorhood might have some associations that you could join.
Et voil√†, its essencially by exposure that you'll make new friends. Once you make 1 connection, its only a matter of time before you make more. Be patient and you'll get there! Hope it helps!
A lot of my more recent friends have come from forming open communications with the people who live in my neighbourhood and also by getting involved in some community initiatives. Especially during Covid, it‚Äôs been amazing to have people around to rely on!
On the corner of The Saint-Urbain and St Catherine, there's a huge chess game. It's been there for almost 10 years and the people who come here and play usually end up being friends! 
You should find a common hobby with people and start joining events.
made new friends through sports group, namely beach vball. i usually play at Jeanne-Mance. Had also made some new ones through ball hockey but i dropped that
I found a roommate my first year in a new city. Along with a new friendship, I also became friends with her friends. After the year, I moved out into my own place.
I usually start with my neighbours :) it‚Äôs easy to be friendly to the people next door. 
Plus everyone is so cool these days.
Allez up climbing is a great gym, and is full of regulars (well before covid) I started going there consistently a few years back and met people pretty quickly! Just started saying hello to familiar faces and it turns into a belayshonship etc etc
Joined a rugby club, best choice of my life. My life would not be the same without it.
You sound like a super cool dude. I'll be your friend.

The only upside with working from home is not having to step out of my house Monday mornings. Otherwise, everything about it sucks ass. I miss seeing people. My motivation has dropped to none. I like my job, I have a great salary, I get along well with most of my colleagues, but I can't stand not having anyone to shoot the shit with, or Teams meetings where everyone interrupts one another constantly/people are stuck on mute/presenter struggles in sharing their screen.
Not at this time of year. UGH.
I miss it TBH. WFH isn't so bad, just the fact that everything is closed/etc is depressing. We really need to get going again soon.

This will be a huge relief for the very at risk community mainly chsld who end up in hospitals at a much higher percentage so hopefully should give our healthcare workers such much needed relief down the line.

It's still unknown. So far it's known that the vaccine protects you against the harsh symptoms of the virus, but there were no published studies about whether a vaccinated person can transmit the virus.  
We'll know more in the months to come.
They literally bought something like ~~8~~10 times more doses than there are people in the country.

It‚Äôs interesting that such a low % of CHSLD staff to whom the vaccine was made available even wanted to be vaccinated. That‚Äôs quite low.
The part I dont understand is why the immunocompromised are almost last on that list.
Unfortunately, I have no family doctor. That's part of my problem. Been waiting to get one for years now...

That's really not great, still better than nothing I guess.
Does anyone actually think through these fucking policies or are they all developed for news headlines?
All I see is a set of reasons to further encourage commercial landlords to neglect their buildings into complete disrepair. We're not going to be talking about renovictions, we're going to be talking about teardown and rebuild condos.
[deleted]
I don't feel like this is enough. This wouldn't have saved my apartment from a $1325 to $1700 rent increase, my landlord only owns two units. Nothing will change until we reimagine how housing functions. It shouldn't be an investment tool.
Let the pro-landlord circlejerk begin! (Hint: a rental certification already exists in Toronto for the last 15 years, do you see any slowdown in investment?...)
Yes, because increasing overhead and fines reduces rental costs very effectively.
But increasing supply by allowing to build higher and denser?  Oh no.  Can't have that!
I predict increased rents if this ever passes.
Situation actuelle: Propri√©taire de triplex, je loue le sous-sol 550$/mois, (le march√© dans mon coin est entre 700-900$ pour des chiasses) chauff√© eau chaude fournie. C'est un IMMENSE 3-1/2, r√©nov√© au go√ªt du jour et luxueux. Plein d'espaces de stationnement (gratuit), d√©neig√© (gratuit et par moi, pas quand le d√©neigeur passe), acc√®s √† la cours et ses installations (dequoi de pamal nice), j'habite l'immeuble et je suis un proprio exemplaire, proactif et r√©actif √† la seconde pr√®s. Pourquoi je loue si bas ? J'ai eu des troubles, je voulais un break et je loue √† une connaissance fiable qui arrive serr√© pour avoir la paix, sinon je me fais ramasser par l'imp√¥t si je ne le loue pas √† des tout croches et que je laisse le logement vaquant.
Situation √† venir: Le locataire va partir, j'vais √™tre √† la mercie de la r√©gie, j'part avec la mentalit√© de marde que je suis un proprio de marde qui boost son loyer de marde, √ßa va √™tre l'enfer, j'vais me tanner, j'vais crisser une pancarte ''√† vendre'', un promoteur immobilier va acheter (gagner l'overbid qu'un particulier ne peut pas accotter) le triplex, crisser √ßa par terre, b√¢tir 2 immeubles √† condo sur le terrain pis louer √ßa 1,200$+/mois.
R√©sultat: Ben criss-toi le dans l'cul pas d'bave ton logement de r√™ve pas cher pis continue de gosser avec tes ''rental certification''. J'suis d'accord que tous les propri√©taires ne sont pas comme moi, que les r√©novictions sont r√©elles et que la plupart sont injustifiables. Mais je suis aussi d'accord que des mesures du genre vont aussi nous faire perdre le peu d'opportunit√©s de louer des logements comme le miens, d'avoir un propri√©taire exemplaire et de payer pour ce que vous avez ou m√™me moins: √ßa va dispara√Ætre compl√®tement au lieu d'√™tre rare.
Y'a moyen de l√©gif√©rer les propri√©taires qui abusent sans d√©courager ceux qui ne le font pas: fuck Projet Montr√©al avec cette certification qui ne fait que masquer les probl√®mes majeurs qui contribuent √† cette situation, dont eux-m√™mes sont les propres instigateurs.
Didn't Valery Plant turn her own building into a unfamilial unit, and then voted a city bilaw to keep ppl from doing that
Ok... Now let's have the same for landlords. Qualified tenants that won't destroy your apartment. This way, landlords can put less money aside for renovations and do them more often. Theses qualified tenants will take care of the unit, so prices won't go up.
Genuine question: when people say rents are too high, what are they comparing them to? What would be an affordable rent price and what data was used to come to the conclusion that this is a fair price?
Doesn't this make it even less likely that developers will build something for rental? I expect this will make the quality of the rentals better but I feel like it'll be at the cost of the quantity of rentals.
I dunno, I find being a landlord so unappealing already. I just sold a condo and got two offers to rent it instead while it was listed. Think about that, people are so desperate for decent rentals they were calling someone who's trying to sell....it's gotten crazy.
But it is an investment. The reason rent goes up is because of the housing prices are high enough to not be able to buy, demand is high enough for apartments because of lack of investors. People in general think landlords are aholes because they charge too much, open your eyes and think if houses prices surge what do you think buildings prices will be and how do you think the morgage is paid, taxes... Oh yeah if you don't pay it than the landlord don't pay it either, maintenance is that something to be considered, in other provinces if we leave the apartment in bad shape we pay to fix it, here we don't who do you think pay for it??? The city???
Government rent-control will always cause a negative effect on the market. You control rent, investors and developers no longer invest in new properties because it is no longer economically feasible. This creates a shortage of rental units. Shortages creates rental cost increase. So because of government intervention, prices will keep going up even faster.

Et je suis m√™me pas politicien... Mais crisse j'ai le gout de le devenir quand je vois des m√©diocres id√©es comme celles-ci... C'est lamentable

Tant qu'a rajouter de la bureaucratie pis de la marde, pourquoi pas juste tout acheter pis faire gerer par la ville?
On parle souvent de la dynamique entre propri√©taires et locataires, mais il se passe quoi avec les gens qui louent 489292 appartements, √† l'insu des propri√©taires, et les sous-louent encore plus chers?
Il n'y a pas vraiment de crise de logement √† Montr√©al, juste un effet de gentrification. Je suis pour la gentrification: beaux quartiers, beaux restaurants, agr√©able. Ceux qui ne peuvent se payer les loyers devront aller plus loin et faire plus de m√©tro, d√©sol√©.
>still better than nothing I guess.
Nope, pire que rien. Plus de bureaucratie, pas plus d'appartement, pas moins de demande, et un gros incitatif a ne jamais r√©nover les immeubles (comme si la ~~RRQ~~  RLQ n'√©tait pas assez).
Tell that to the landlords that have to pay thousands upons thousands of dollars in renovations after the Tenant trashes the place before leaving.
Exactly, This is BS.
> or are they all developed for news headlines?
Celui-la. Ca va etre une catastrophe mais ca fite dans le narratif de la-gentille-mairesse-qui-attaque-les-m√©chants-proprios.
I'm pretty sure lots of landlords neglect their buildings without policymakers "forcing" them via regulations lol. Weak excuse.
It is true that jurisdiction with rent control tend to have the most neglected buildings.
Il a aucun droit d'augmemter tu as juste √† refuser et il devra aller √† la r√©gie pour justifier la hausse.
Here are the laws that apply to increases.
No where in here, despite what some of these whiny boys say, does it say that the landlord is allowed to raise the rents because THEY decided to pay 900k for an income property.
They can raise your rent but it's legally no more than $100 at best. 
http://legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/showDoc/cr/T-15.01,%20r.%202?&digest=
Fight every notice they send you. Get everyone in the building on board and go together.
There are many laws protecting the tenants from rent hikes.
Don't listen to these losers on here about how you shouldn't expect to live "in a cushy low rent". The landlord can't hike rents just because he is wealthy enough to buy an income property. He isn't your kind. We don't live in the Commons any more.
Everything the new landlord proposes or tells you they're doing, submit it to the R√©gie as a complain of harassment and also as a rejection of their offer.
There are tenants rights advocates that can help as well.
Trust me when I tell you, the landlord has very little ground to stand on. Stick up for yourself. Get organized with the other tenants and don't let these losers dissuad you from pursuing the landlord even in small claims court.
Sue the shit out of them!!!!! Don't take the harassment!!!
Comme Jerry dit, laisse ton nouveau proprio aller justifier √ßa √† la r√©gie. Il devra fournir des papiers pour justifier la hausse et elle ne pourra pas d√©passer un certain pourcentage √† mon souvenir, peu importe ton loyer actuel.
If your still paying 600$ for a 5 1/2 in a duplex that sold for 900k, it will be quite a wake-up call... No amount of negotiation will look reasonable when the true value is like 2k/month...
Dis-toi que moins tu paies cher, plus t‚Äôas le gros bout du baton et plus t‚Äôas du jeu pour n√©gocier. Si il n‚Äôest pas dans son droit de reprendre ton logement (dans le cas contraire, t‚Äôas peu de chose √† faire), h√©site pas √† le faire payer.
The root of the problem is that land supply is limited, and as such, land ownership is a great store of value. Housing is just a byproduct
What's the alternative? We have a free market and housing is a necessary commodity with a very high demand, and limited supply.
We're face to face with the laws of supply and demand here.
Im sure it put an end to slum lords
No, instead all of the investment is for condos instead of rentals.
I do think that IF implemented well this could be a good idea (as long as it's combined with measures to help fix the real source of the problem). But using Toronto as an example of a healthy rental market is just not good for your argument.
I would gladly have a rental regestry if i could rent at Toronto prices
you know what else exist in Toronto? Month to month rent after the first year's lease. Meaning people can just walk away from their apartments with a one months notice, instead of the charade of passing along cheap rents through lease transfers.
Did it stop rent hikes in Toronto?
"The certification will be required of landlords who have buildings with eight or more units throughout the City of Montreal, representing nearly 216,000 units," 
En quoi √ßa concerne ton triplex?? Lis donc un peu avant de t'enflammer! Prends une grande respiration pis va lire l'article, c'est juste pour les gros plex de 8+ unit√©s.
Not really. She merged two units in her 5plex, which is still allowed under new rules. Also, this is under borough jurisdiction, so the mayor doesn't vote on such changes.
Found the bootlicker
Montr√©al used to have absurdly cheap rents. We‚Äôre talking, have a huge apartment to yourself  kind of rent
>I expect this will make the quality of the rentals better but I feel like it'll be at the cost of the quantity of rentals.
Both quality and quantity.
* Quality: rent is somehow locked (it already is anyway) plus you have to go through a considerable list of admin crap. Why would a landlord pour money into an unit to make it better with all the costs (taxes, upkeep, materials, etc.) going up?
* Quantity: why build more if a promoter knows a potential buyer won't get the same returns and that therefore landlords won't pay good cash for their shitty buildings? They'll just build more condos where they can get a good ROI and single homes for people who can actually afford to sink 1M+ in a house.
Projet Montr√©al is doing shit for both tenants and landlords. Tenants are already protected against unreasonable rent hikes and evictions. The TAL is already there to provide this kind of protection and they are really zealous about that. Val√©rie is just campaigning with more stupid empty promises to get the tenants' votes. Simple as that.
Or they wanted to get in the door to extort the future buyer to vacate the place early when they want to move into their newly purchased property.
Not disagreeing but adding nuance: rents are not subject to control for 5 years in new constructions. 
Also, more than half of new units produced in Montreal these past few years were not condos, but rental units
Pour conseiller des gens avec leurs potentiels achats d'immobilier, je peux te dire que  pour 95 % c'est simplement inconcevable de construire un nouvel immeuble dans la r√©gion de Montr√©al et d'y louer des appartements ¬´ standard ¬ª.  
Presque tout ce qui se fait de neuf c'est de la construction de condo ou des appartements de luxe. Les investisseurs ont simplement aucun int√©r√™t √† construire quelque chose qui va contenir des appartements, ils veulent √©viter √† tout prix d'√™tre sous la jurisdiction de la r√©gie, et √† lire certaines de leurs d√©cision, je ne peux pas les blamer.   
Bref, il n'y en aura pas de construction de nouvel appartement.
Lol, what!

Glad about the investment but from what I understand it is not in an ideal place. A big part of the indigenous homelessness in that area is because there was a shelter (near the YMCA or at the YMCA) that was nearby. Many of the people who would be seen needed a nearby park to hang out at, and at night had missed the curfew so were forced to sleep rough. Moreover that shelter/hostel was used a lot for flown in northerners needing to see a specialist at the hospital. Obviously the location made sense before the mega hospital but I can not help but think something a little closer to the Glen would be ideal.
"Unprecedented donation for shelter that works with homeless people from Indigenous communities"
Is the second headline, I am glad they used the word invests in the main headline.
These should be looked at as investments that strengthen our communities; not a cost nor a donation!
We should easily save $3million on all the different costs (hospital resources, social programs, having healthier and more secure families, police resources, etc etc etc).
I would love to see some pilot program go on that has unthreatening social workers respond to or even hang around the square cabot area instead of heavy police monitoring.
Il semble qu'on oublie √ßa de plus en plus de ce temps ci. C'est bien voir des bonnes nouvelles pour faire changement!
Meanwhile the contract goes to snc Lavalin  and the initial 3 million projected cost to taxpayers that is will probably run us around 15 million. Ahhhhhh yes, because when was the last time that you saw a downtown house being built at $3 million dollars, impossibl. I think there needs to be more of a traceability when it comes to contracts like this and quebecers need to be more vigilant and follow the money and hold these companies and dealings with a system of checks and balances in order to follow through and assure that these are being done on the up and up.
Because government subsidiarities and tax breaks for these corporations that have gone in and gentrified neighborhoods and taken away from affordable costing housing for not only the homeless but for everyone and forcing us out of our neighborhoods and further out of the city because of the rising costs. Which in fact falling to the cost of the people of Montreal me and you with rising tax prices for property tax the cost of school tax neighborhood tax and it's just keeps on going up and these billion-dollar corporations a 3 million dollar donation is a drop in the bucket especially if you take into account the future estimated earnings that these corporations will pull in.
Unfortunately it's like that everywhere.

Local problems  require local solutions.
The church at the corner of Ren√©-L√©vesque and Atwater closed years ago, then they closed the square for at least a year to fix it up. Homeless people still came back after all that. I think it's great that they put it near there, that's where they like to hang out, let them!

Want to explain why or should I assume that the beauty of Cabot Square is just too irresistible?
√áa sonne boomer pas mal ces deux commentaires-l√†...
Les journaux n'√©tait pas remplis de mauvaise nouvelles dans votre bon vieux temps?
Not to be confused with its groovier cousin, SNC Lava Lamp
Fair enough that's a good point you know but they just you know and I'm not trying to take away from this good news either and I apologize for seeing being like a Debbie Downer, this is excellent news and and I'm happy for the people that are going to be able to benifit. 
All I'm saying is that we need to make sure that these type of transactions are followed through. It's that if we follow the money and see where it's being going and see these contracts continually be going to these types of companies as a sub default when something goes wrong I don't consider that a solution I mean banks have just this year have made 3.8 billion dollars in profits that's more than last year when we weren't in a pandemic I'm sorry but I don't know anybody who's making a lot of money this year on the contrary I know a lot of people that are struggling and getting through Bill to Bill and worried about the future but yet the banks are able to make more money this year than they did last year get the f*** out of here, how? from where if interest rates have been dropped due to pandemic relief to an all-time low it's not from interest rates so where are they getting this money that at the end of the day is paid by taxpayers me and you.. 
you think that is a coincidence that construction workers have secured jobs for the next $250 years I don't think so how was that the strongest job potential in Quebec at the moment for future well at least it was last year and the thing is I don't know how many times I've seen them fix the same pothole or the same part of the street numerous times yet there's no system to check these obvious fraudulent well I'll give you does help the economy by giving people jobs but yet there's got to be a medium of an acceptable amount of fraudulent activity versus full on flat in your face boom n g a f attitude and the general consensus of this egregious acts of our government is "c'est comme √ßa √ßa marche ici au Qu√©bec" attitude of complacency which I'm sorry is not an adequate solution or excuse for what's going on . If we continue to allow these companies to continue to us which protect them and don't protect the citizens you think that they're going to work on an honor based code not all Canadians are honorable so what makes you think that these companies that are run on a larger scale based on profit and shareholders if they as well when given the choice between getting paper or doing The Honorable right thing what do you think they're going to choose? 100 to one if you look at their track record but you know there's always the future possibility that they might do the right thing eventually.
That's illegal too bad they probably don't have enough money to get a lawyer to represent them and take them to court and I mean f*** suing a yeah that's really f***** up. at the local grocery store where I work I'm there in direct contact all the time with people and the fact that they really don't try to slow down the amount of people inside that grocery store and I asked them I was like when you guys getting your vaccines you should be soon right you're essential workers and places are just really doing these people dirty.
Yeah, I know one of the employees. Sounds like their case at the labour board is going well, at least.
People go there to go there, because they know other northerners will be there in a city of millions. 
It is more due to that than due to the old shelter influence, as that reason predates the shelter being so popular in the first place.
 It's a holdover from the children's hospital era nearby like you said, but it's less about missing curfews to the shelters you were talking about than you're assuming so they have to sleep there, and more just a place inuit and Cree know they can find inuit and Cree.
**Tout** allait bien jusqu'en 2016. La pauvret√© est une invention des zoomers.
des putains de g√©nis
Probably also worth noting that they'Re purchasing the building, not buying a new one...
The employees took em to the labour board and from what I hear it's actually gone pretty well - they'll have to pay out a fair amount of money, apologize, etc.
From what I hear the employees took em to the labour board and are likely to agree to a pretty solid settlement.
Ok great. So while it is currently a holdover, that does not mean it will be in five years. That is why I suggested the investment should go somewhere closer to the glen that will be more pragmatic in fifteen years.
But the thing is like a day shelters nice but $3 million for a place where people can't even spend the night is a bit of a slap in the face. on top of that I think that we need to increase the representation of indigenous people within the government so we don't have another French Quebec white man saying what the indigenous Community needs and doesn't need cuz I mean common sense for me tells me that if you build the shelter it should shelter people at night when people need shelter not during the day ( that's what the stm is for)
Okay that's a good point actually I was unaware of that but why are they purchasing the building was it because the previous owner was unable to get contracts and permits required by the city in order to build it? I know a lot of buildings out the parts stadium have had numerous problems with s*** like that. But you're right to read furnish a building versus building a new one from scratch yeah it's a lot less costly that's that's for darn sure. I wonder what the taxes on a building like that would be annually, or would it be like a church where they don't have to pay taxes since it's like a charitable.
No, you're missing the point, it's no longer anchored by medical services. 
We know where the hospitals are, we know where places to stay are. 
That's just a place we know we can run into other northerners. That's why people go there now. That's totally different than what you think is the raison d'√™tre. It's not a "holdover", it's a meeting place for the sake of meeting.
not every hangout remains as such though. It may be for the next few years, but it could well change. I would love to see you suggest there is something other that maintains the space longterm brides this investment. I like the idea of there being an "indigenous mosaic" in the city like there is a china town, but nothing about the area seems to have enshrined northerners to have that (yet or in the time when the services made it such)
Looks like a face with the lighting.. nom nom
Gros baisse de qualit√© chez eux malheureusement
Only thing I hate about that area is the 10 mile exit line to get off Decarie for Jean-Talon. It's literally traffic 24/7 there. Has to be the worst exit in Montreal after the Saint-Michel one on the 40 or the 440 one on the 15
Great burgers but they're damn expensive.
Un classique, quand on revenait de l'europe en avion on arr√™tait y prenser un poutine, rien de plus OG quec que √ßa!
Oh que tu viens de me donner une envie de hot dogs!
La Naranja!!
Merci pour la belle photo! M'en va amener ma fille √† soir pour 2 r√¥teux pis un Julep!
Is the vintage car show on Wednesdays still going?
Pacman eating a car!
The pricing there makes me want to puke. Like $16 for a hot dog, poutine and a small julep.
Why do the orange juice feels like more and more sugarcane every time i visit.
S√©rieusement! Can't unsee
Almost wonder if there should be a face. The Big Apple, on the way to Toronto has a face.
J'ai commencer √† aller vers 1980 pis je suis jamais vraiment aller pour la qualit√©, j'aime bien leur bouffe mais c'est du fast food extra-greesy.
ouin pis juste en face il y a un La Belle Province qui est pas mal meilleur
Comment √ßa? Je sais que le prix est cher mais pour moi √ßa go√ªte pareil
Meh, on y va pas pour tellement pour la bouffe mais pour le jus, et regarder les gens pimper leurs voitures.
M'a t'prend' deux roteux all-dress' steam√©s, s'ou-plat.
Yes, and motorcyclists usually gather there on Thursdays
Yes, it‚Äôs from around 6 to 9. But it‚Äôs always best to come earlier than later!
Haha yeah it‚Äôs certainly one of its kind!
Qui vas la pour la bouffe tho ? All about that juice
Cool! Someone mentioned that it's a lot of newer cars now, is there still a decent vintage crowd? :)
I have only been there once, but there are still many many old cars there from what I saw on YouTube!
Tu sais que la nouvelle marquise est super utile quand tu as besoin d'un parapluie dessous..
are the streets all filled in and repaired? haven't been since SDQC first opened.
[deleted]
Des magasins de parfum qui ont pas de nom!!!
Should post this in /r/raining
Cette nouvelle marquise est compl√®tement insipide, sans √¢me et g√©n√©rique, en plus de laisser passer les pr√©cipitations (je sais qu'il y a une raison technique li√©e aux fa√ßades, ceci dit).  
L'ancienne √©tait moche mais avait de la personnalit√©, quelque chose de distinctif, du kitsch qu'on apprend √† appr√©cier.  
C'est dommage car la Plaza c'est chouette, y'a de l'excellente bouffe, des bars et des commerces int√©ressants.
Great shot! I just wish it was a permanent pedestrian street. sigh
Honestly I would take the pigeons back if it meant not being rained/snowed on. Did many late evening walks from IGA to the 18 bus, two sacks of groceries in hand and no hands left for an umbrella heheh.
Ah oui, la rue √©quivalente √† la 6i√®me page de r√©sultats sur amazon avec toutes les b√©belles cheaps avec des gros markups. 
C'est plate √† dire, mais le probl√®me de la rue c'√©tait pas la marquise, mais les magasins cheaps. On dirait tous des dollaramas, mais qui vendre chacun un rayon (Ici on a les souliers cheap, ici les parfums cheaps, ici les ...)
Damm, what time did you take that yesterday? We might've crossed paths
Avec les osties de tiges invisibles!
Beaut√© int√©grale
Pourquoi rendre quelque chose d'encombrant utile plut√¥t que simplement √©sth√©tique (discutable) ?
C'est sec en dessous (je m'y promenais hier) mais il y a effectivement un gap entre la marquise et la facade.
Mais ts√©, est-ce que c'√©tait si utile en partant? M√™me avec ses marquises (plus?) fonctionnelles, les centre-villes qui ont essay√© de comp√©titionner avec les centres d'achats dans les ann√©es 80 ont fait patate parce que le vent fait quand m√™me rentrer l'eau sur le c√¥t√© et il faut ben traverser la rue un moment donn√© et c'est juste pas l'fun √™tre dehors quand il pleut.
On avait des marquises au centre-ville √† Sherbrooke quand j'√©tais petite et c'√©tait un no man's land avec des degr√©s variables de glauquitude selon les ann√©es. C'est beaucoup mieux maintenant sans les marquises (et aussi la culture a co√Øncidemment g√©n√©ralement quand m√™me shift√© et les gens ont repris go√ªt au magasinage √† l'ext√©rieur).
On sacrifie le pratique pour l esthetique.
yes, and it's fully pedestrian until Sunday IIRC.
Aaaaaaahhhhhhhh. Je te hauvote en col√®re. Lol
Des grosses robes de mari√©es!
Des boutiques de perruques et de pose d'ongles!
Perso je pr√©f√®re la nouvelle √† l'ancienne, mais √©videmment tous les go√ªts sont dans la nature.
Ca d√©pend la hauteur de la rue. Entre B√©langer et Beaubien il y a quand m√™me des endroits sympathiques pour les v√™tements, quelques belles librairies, un des meilleurs glaciers de la ville, quelques restos et bars cools.
Apr√®s au nord de JT c'est moins nice, t'as juste des magasin d'habits de mariage et de perruques les uns √† c√¥t√© des autres.
Je pense que tu devrais y retourner. Il ya beaucoup de "nouveaux" commerces. Barbiers, meubles, restos, librairies, tattoo shops, etc.
tu voudrais gentrifier la plaza st-hubert ?
pourquoi pas les deux vu tout l'argent et le temps de planification allou√©?
Ouuui √ßa me gosse tellement! Fais que la neige s'accumule des 2 c√¥t√©s, mais m√™me en dessous, t'as les poteaux qui bloquent le chemin fais que quand il fait laid, ben on peut √™tre 1-2 max en dessous.
Je les trouvais super utile justement! J'habite proche et c'√©tait super nice d'avoir le trottoir sec en n'importe quelle saison. Apr√®s traverser la rue c'est 1 minute compar√© a un magasinage de 1-2 heures..
√áa m'intrigue les marquises au centre-ville.. J'aurais tendance √† penser que c'√©tait glauque parce que le centre-ville c'est gris et beaucoup d'immeubles..
Ouais exact, la Plaza, surtout la section sud, est vraiment cool. Rajoute √† ta liste une des meilleures place de dumplings, un cordonnier super efficace, des boutiques de gaming/hobby et une vieille salle de spectacle avec du cachet.
Oui √ßa deviens de mieux en mieux. Mais c'est justement mon point. 
La rue prend du mieux parce que les magasins de b√©belle cheap se font remplacer petit √† petit par des commerces nices. 
> mais le probl√®me de la rue c'√©tait pas la marquise, mais les magasins cheaps.
C'√©tait UP. 
Maintenant c'est rendu DOWN. 
J'aimerais bien que √ßa retourne √† UP.
Hey dans le temps la plaza st-hubert c'√©tait une place de magasinage comme Saint-Catherine...
Si pour toi remplacer les magasins de b√©belle de merde qui clairement n'attire personne par des magasins de qualit√© c'est de la "gentrification"...
Que les magasins changent ou pas ca change rien √† la gentrification de saint-hubert, il est d√©j√† beaucoup trop tard. Les maisons et condos alentour se vendent √† des prix compl√®tement hors de port√© de la grande majorit√© des habitants du coin. C'est juste une question de temps maintenant.
Dans le cas de Sherbrooke, je pense que l'ouverture d'un gros centre d'achat a juste tu√© le centre-ville, comme c'est arriv√© √† bien des endroits (genre ce qui est racont√© dans La Rue Principale des Colocs).
Dans les ann√©es 80, les centres d'achats c'√©tait juste vraiment excitant et les commerces de centre-villes ont juste d√©m√©nag√© au cendre d'achat ou ont rush√© pendant plusieurs ann√©es. 
√Ä Sherbrooke, la ville a install√© des marquises en se disant que les gens allaient au centre d'achat pour √©viter le mauvais temps, mais dans le contexte o√π les gens √©taient excit√©s par le concept m√™me des centres d'achats, les marquises faisaient pas du tout le poids, beau temps, mauvais temps. Avec la moiti√© des commerces ferm√©s et les quelques commerces qui restaient qui √©taient juste trop louches pour le centre commercial, √ßa a fini par faire un centre-ville pas pire creepy. 
De nos jours, l'engouement pour les centres d'achats diminue, alors avec un bon plan d'am√©nagement (qui incluait le d√©mant√®lement complet des marquises, parce qu'elles √©taient rendues pas mal magan√©es) et des incitatifs financiers, les commerces et les restaurants ont recommenc√© √† s'installer au centre-ville et c'est rendu quand m√™me cute, limite un peu trop bobo. 
Enlever compl√®tement les marquises a quand m√™me rendu la rue plus lumineuse √† Sherbrooke. J'imagine que le but sur la Plaza √©tait de faire un compromis entre la protection de la pluie et la lumi√®re. Ou c'est juste esth√©tique et √ßa se veut un coin d'oeil √† l'√©poque marquise de la Plaza.
Et aussi un des tailleurs les plus sympathiques de la ville, Gamache Tailleur !
Enti√®rement d'accord, j'esp√®re juste que la pandemie est pas tu√© le mince espoir que St-Hubert soit pu rempli de magasin cheap et de magasins de marriage.
c'est pareil avec Ontario , St-Laurent, Wellington (Verdun) , Notre-Dame (St-Henri) ...
Mais a part pour des robes de mariee, ca jamais ete si UP que ca...
quand j'etais jeune ma mere achetais mes vetements chez croteau et mes bebelles venait de chez Rossy et autres 5-10-15
Super int√©ressant, merci de cette perspective! C'est vrai que j'ai grandi avec les centres d'achats - √ßa devait √™tre fou dans les ann√©es 80!
Ah ben si toutes deviens horrible c'est bien acceptable d'avoir des magasins avec juste 5000 gougounes made in china qui p√®te 3 secondes apr√®s les avoirs mis. 
Tr√®s important de niveler par le bas sinon ya du monde qui crie "GENTRIFICATION"
√áa d√©j√† √©t√© plus UP qu'en ce moment. √áa tire de la patte comparer √† ce que c'√©tait avant.
Ben ts√©, ne suis pas siiii vieille, alors je me rappelle juste de la fin  80 et des ann√©es 90, quand le mal √©tait d√©j√† fait et que l'id√©e de juste aller chiller au centre-ville √©tait impensable.
Ca fait longtemps que je ne suis pas aller dans ce coin la, je te crois. Mais pour moi ca jamais √©t√© tres "hot". (Ann√©es 70s et 80s)
J'ai pas grandi √† Montr√©al donc j'avoue que je sais pas trop..
Moi j'ai grandi √† Sherbrooke, alors je sais pas non plus de quoi √ßa avait l'air √† Montr√©al. Ma m√®re avait l'air de penser qu'il y avait des drive-by shooting quotidien, mais elle est un peu sheltered.
Good; that's a better use of our public green space. It will be nice to have one dang place in this city I can go for a few hours without seeing, hearing, or smelling a car. 
And unlike the closure of Voie Camillien-Houde, it's not part of anyone's regular commute, so I imagine there will be less outcry and less reason to later reverse this.
It has a metro station. Leave the car in Longueuil, or take the Orange or Green and transfer. My only slight concern is that the station doesn't have an elevator, so they either need to leave parking for folks with disabilities, or accelerate the construction of elevators along the Yellow Line. (Or both!)
C'est moi ou la photo utilis√©e dans l'article prise avant la construction de la place Evenko (me rappel pu du vrai nom) montre a quel point c'est laite cet affaire l√†. Y'avait pleins d'arbres avant et l√† c'est une grosse slab de b√©ton et de gravier :(
Formidable! Les gens devraient aller au parc Jean-Drapeau de la m√™me fa√ßon qu'ils vont au Parc Lafontaine ou Jeanne-Mance, on a un immense espace si proche du centre ville et on dirait qu'on s'en sert pour 3 √©v√©nements par ann√©e et c'est tout.
So no more F1? Lol üòÇ
Et la cr√©ation de marais filtrants !
> le nombre de places de stationnement sur les deux √Æles sera consid√©rablement r√©duit
My favorite words.
Awesome! Finally some progress! As usual all the pro car people will huff and puff and then when they go they will be like ‚Äúwow, this park i never spent any time in is awesome! Love it‚Äù. Some people resist change at all cost. Same with the st Denis REV. All parking complaint people have suddenly ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù when they see that there is still plenty of parking, but one can actually comfortably walk without being next to millions of parked cars. Bravo!
And La Ronde agreed to this how?
great idea
Premi√®res images ici: https://twitter.com/Val_Plante/status/1382353710538440706
Il vont amener les autos de course pour la F1 en traversier?
Bon... rip moi qui travaille √† la ronde et qui habite √† presque 50 minutes de char I guess (transport en commun va prendre 1h40-2h and le trajet en bus is very unreliable where i live) :s
On va faire comment nous qui travaillons a La Ronde? Perso moi je prends le m√©tro mais la majorit√© y vont en auto car pour beaucoup y aller en transport en commun leur convient pas
I wonder if you'll still be able to pass around it? I use it every day to commute to work since I work on the south shore. It saves so much time not having to pass on peel where all the construction is to get to the highway just to get to jaques cartier bridge. It's great coming back too, I avoid all the traffic at the end of the bridge. Oh well, even if it closes, I plan on leaving the island in a year for the shore. This will probably take 10 years before anything gets done haha
Donc, en dehors de la F1, plus d'autos du tout sur le circuit Gilles Villeneuve?
Ah ben... , √ßa va maintenant √™tre plus facile pour les Qu√©b√©cois de se rendre au Six Flags de Lake George, NY
meh, as long as they keep parking spots there I don't see this as a big deal imo.
Beurk encore plus de monde dans le m√©tro.
caliss....
Une promotion avec le m√©tro serait nice aussi. Je ne sais pas comment √ßa peut marcher. Mais une famille de 4 o√π 5 √ßa va co√ªter 20-25 dollars de plus pour aller au parc.
!!!
Yes. I run/bike quite often in Jean Drapeau (from my place, usually via the Jacques Cartier bridge or de la Concorde) and holyyyy is it sketchy sometimes. From the Jacques Cartier pedestrian/bike lane there are no sidewalks until you get down the hill, and cars drive like it's the F1. I would estimate that 90% don't even do a rolling stop for any stop sign and dodge the speed bumps (sometimes nearly hitting people). Many drivers are extremely belligerent towards pedestrians/cyclists they meet as well. You. Are. In. A. Park. On. An. Island. None. Of. These. Roads. Go. Anywhere. This. Shit. Is. Not. Serious. 
There is really no excuse for this. The park is accessible by metro, bike/foot from both sides, and there's also a ferry if you want to do the scenic thing. The park has an internal bus shuttle as well if you are less mobile and want to get around. There's also a Bixi station or two.
Do people really commute through Camilien Houde? Unless you live at the Summit Circle and are going to Jeanne-Mance, I can't see how it's ever the most efficient route. Going through Pine instead can't be that much longer.
Aren't cars still allowed to parc there though
Back when I was a young idiot, I used to drive to work downtown and one favourite traffic bypass was to take Jacques Cartier and then get off and take the island drive to downtown and vice versa at night. Could save 10-15 minutes and it was a pleasant drive.
En plus que la navette fluviale sera renforc√©e, notamment avec un second d√©barcad√®re sur l'Ile Notre-Dame
Un beau cadeau de Coderre √† ses amis d'Evenko.
Ayoye oui c'est un peu d√©solant! Comparatif : https://i.imgur.com/GrXAild.png
En plus, au seul Heavy Montreal qu'il a eu la bas, IL FAIT CHAUD avec ce ciment partout!  C'est ridicule et laid. Et ils en ont pas profiter pour mettre des abrevoires et des toilettes partout, noooon, encore des lineup de 3h pour pisser ( quand t'es pas asser saoul.e pour juste pisser plus ou moins  a cote d'un arbre, cloture, truck food ou agent de securite )
Quand tu vois le pauvre acc√®s que la soci√©t√© du pont daigne accorder aux pi√©tons et v√©los sur le pont, √ßa donne moyen envie d'y aller..
Faudrait que le traversier soit inclus dans la carte opus.
Pas la m√™me √Æle
Aussi, avec la quantit√© d'argent que √ßa apporte, √ßa m'√©tonnerait vraiment que qui que ce soit essaye vraiment d'annuler la course, surtout que le contrat est bon pour encore environ 10 ans.
Ce serait bien d'y mettre Coderre, histoire de le filtrer une fois pour toute!
Yeah I don't think so. As a driver, I can tell you that driving there is a fucking calamity if you're even moderately concerned about safety.
The intersections are all fucky, you can't see shit anywhere, there are stops in the weirdest places and the lighting is awful. Google Maps redirected me through there once and no, never again. I'd rather take the long way around.
La Ronde poss√®de son propre terrain et celui-ci inclue un stationnement... c'est obligatoire. La ville ne pourra pas emp√™cher le voyagement des automobiles vers la Ronde.
Parc Jean-Drapeau != √éle Sainte-H√©l√®ne.
ouin . Super le parc pas de voiture mais j'avais pas penss√© a √ßa. Les famille qui ne sont pas de mtl qui vont a la ronde devront se stationer ou a l'avenir
They are renters. And considering they‚Äôve been doing the bare minimum to keep their contract, they can just suck it for all I care
Six Flags perhaps would like this idea to take parking lot and build more rides as this is something they always wanted since they acquired La Ronde.
The original idea was to remove the Marina but then it was government owned and they couldn't.

Is it worth working at La Ronde tho? I heard the working conditions are ass.
Why not take Champlain? The new bridge is awesome and the 15 in that direction is mostly clear in the morning.
on me downvote parce que je pose une question? Reddit/r/montreal est bizarre parfois.
Estie qu'il est poche ce Six Flags-l√†, s√©rieux je pensais pas qu'il se faisait pire que La Ronde avant que je visite The Great Escape. √áa tombe en ruines.
Le stationnement est pas genre $15 pour la journ√©e?
Je vais souvent au parc, juste pour marcher... mais je suis curieux, qu'est-ce que les petites familles vont y faire?
I've had the exact same experience. Not sure who in their right mind thinks it's ok to go double the speed limit in a park, but holy shit do I not feel safe biking in some parts of it.
Quand je demeurais au Rockhill et que je travaillais √† Hydro au centre ville, c‚Äô√©tait vraiment le plus rapide en auto et de loin. Mais c‚Äô√©tait encore mieux en v√©lo ou m√™me √† pied.
Been using Communauto myself for a month or so to go hiking within 150km around Mtl. I usually go on Fridays, reserve for a whole day at a nearby station 2-3 days in advance and it's been working well so far. It's $70-90 a pop so it makes the hikes a bit expensive but having no other use for a car, it's still cheaper than buying and having to deal with insurance, gas, parking, general maintenance and ugh.. winter amirite üòÖ. 
Point is, I'm pretty happy. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.
I feel you. I'm in Rosemont and its the same situation. I'm probably going to end up buying a car.
Haha yeah I feel you. In general tho Communauto is excellent. I'm surprised I like it as much as I do.
Did communauto increase their offer when car2go left the city or is there a vacuum that hasnt been filled since?
J'ai utilis√© Communauto pendant 3-4 ans il y a 10 ans... Et d√©j√† dans ce temps avoir des autos disponibles √©tait un vrai probl√®me. Courailler des chars aux quatres coins de la ville √©tait la seule solution. J'ai achet√© une auto depuis et je ne reviendrais plus en arri√®re!
La colonisation des fran√ßais se fait observer
Impossible de se parker au sud de St-Joseph jusqu'au vieux-port honn√™tement.
C'est vraiment un calvaire sans solution. Le politique soit ignore le probl√®me ou l'empire.
I'm actually shocked you have so many cars available, must have been very early in the afternoon. Last 2 weekends I kept refreshing and there was about 3 FLEX available in the entire city.   
It's got to a point where I honestly don't always follow the "leave car in a spot free of parking restrictions until midnight the next day" rule because I know the car will snatched way before I'd get a ticket.
On a une petite auto d√©j√† pay√©e, achet√©e seconde main en 2015, et lorsqu'elle rendra l'√¢me on h√©site √† utiliser communauto mais je t'avoue que √ßa l'air assez peu fourni dans notre secteur (hochelaga maisonneuve) et surtout, je suis pas persuad√© de l'efficacit√© avec deux enfants en bas age dont il faudra toujours transvaser les si√®ges auto pour chaque trajet :-/
even communauto, try getting a car on weekends its like a competition renting 30 days before you need one. 
i find the best place to get a automobile is st-michele, my friend can pretty much get them whenever as people keep dropping them off there.
ELI5: never used this app, so if I understand right, there are cars pretty much all over the city except in the Plateau?
Si seulement il y avait un truc comme [celui-ci](https://youtu.be/OObwqreAJ48?t=170) √† Mtl, √ßa causerait un peu moins de probl√®mes du genre, et probablement un peu moins d'autos aussi.
St henri knows your pain üò©
try Turo sometimes its an alternative... my car as been rented most of the summer since June .. but you might find gems on the platform
All the fucking tiiime. Pass√© 7 h 30 oublie √ßa. Tr√®s d√©sagr√©able.
Annoying but if you‚Äôre not in a rush take public transit to one of the cars with the little gift on it. 30 free minutes!
(But yeah, very annoying when you‚Äôre in a rush)
Ooof yeah Verdun is usually pretty sad too, fridays and weekends I usually have to grab a bixi to ville emard to find one.  
Honestly these last two years the service has been pretty lousy. The cars are alwats super dirty, broken, or need a fluid fill up and tire fill. Also the app is buggy as hell.
You should have seen it on the long weekend, there were like 2 cars on the entire island.
I‚Äôm considering cancelling because of this. I rent full days from time to time but not so often, and i was really looking forward to an option for unplanned trips and quick errands.
I think we need new players in the market, with the electrical shift coming Communauto will grow stronger i guess.
Why isn't Communauto in Toronto though?
Ooh there‚Äôs one in Verdun near me
As you can see, Rosemont isnt doing any better lol. When the SO and I try to book one, it usually has to be a good 2 weeks in advance to have one within a reasonable walking distance.
I love it for the flex cars in the city. I love being able to drive somewhere and then take public transit back, or vice versa, plus never getting a parking ticket -- amazing! 
What I don't love is the long distance cars. They've been impossible to reserve all summer, and that's mostly why I need a car. I use flex for errands and for work, but I could get taxi's/budget for more time on public transit if I didn't have Communauto. Because of the difficulty in booking long distance cars, I won't be continuing after my first year membership is over.
No one has mentioned that they continue to expand their zones more north and east. For folks that are living closer to the core of the city, it‚Äôs just going to get worse as more and more cars get left at the edges of the growing zones even if they add more cars. Not exactly sure how they will figure that part out. Either way, I still enjoy using Flex by nabbing a car early morning and keeping it, or booking weeks in advance for a regular Communauto. It‚Äôs still cheaper and more convenient than owning a car, and I‚Äôm saying this as a member for over a decade.
Turo?
uber ?
hahahahhahahahahaha
If you're going to reserve it for a whole day in advance, and pay that much, what's the benefit over an old fashioned rental? /genuine
>it's still cheaper than buying and having to deal with insurance, gas, parking, general maintenance and ugh.. winter amirite üòÖ. 
100% 
I'm only cribbing about FLEX. Although Reserving a car for the weekend has to be done 3 weeks in advance :D
Other than that it's an amazing service that in my opinion should be expanded considerably.
[deleted]
I live on the south shore (Longueuil M√©tro), I stopped using them because the cars were NEVER available (even for short trips like grocery shopping) and the cars were always either damaged, dirty or had some sort of mechanical issue.
Bought a car, more expensive but I can at least use it now lol
any hikes you'd recommend ? I'm desperate to go on one but don't really know where people go around here
Same for us, actually getting one inspected this weekend. I'm sick of stopping at a garage and inflating the tires of the communautos, or struggling to find one at all.
Consider an ebike ;) or a cheap second hand car!
Good luck with that the car industry is as busy and in demand
Oh I love it. Other than the availability of flex, I make reservations for the weekends and they're amazing!
OTOH, when I do find a FLEX, I feel like I've won the lottery and that totally makes my day :D
I miss car2go every day, the cars were a lot cleaner and they had a better selection. If they were still in town we wouldn't be looking for a car to buy right now, I think.
They've been hit by the car shortages too. They're trying their best to up their offering (I complained to them this week about the same thing) and are having a hard time procuring the cars to meet demand at this point.
They have added hundreds of cars since, but it‚Äôs a complicated business model. Summer week end is peak chalet seasons for the Communauto crowd, taking car for expanded amounts of time, but you just have to think about what happens to this car on a random Tuesday in November.
They did.
>Regarding the FLEX offer, following the departure of ShareNow announced last December, Communauto reacted quickly by ordering 325 vehicles which will be added to its free-floating offer which already included 730 units.
Source: https://blogue.communauto.com/communauto-adds-700-vehicles-canada-in-2020/?lang=en
They bought more cars. I don‚Äôt miss car2go. Less space in the car because IKEA/costco/ rona/ etc. Also not that much cheaper for a car less pleasurable to drive. Parking was easy tho!
Le nombre de fois que j'avais une r√©servation et que quelqu'un s'√©tait sauv√© avec l'auto! Avant l'application mobile... J'imagine que maintenant ce n'est plus possible.
Si c'est pour des all√©-retour regarde les stations communauto (pas Flex) autour de toi, certaines voitures en station ont un si√®ge pour enfant dans la voiture d√©j√†, ce qui peut √™tre pratique (juste 1 par contre)
C'est difficile de faire la transition... Ce qui me manquait le plus lorsque j'√©tais 100% Communauto c'√©tait la spontan√©it√©. Si tu d√©cides vendredi PM que tu vas bouger, c'est habituellement trop tard, tout est r√©serv√©. Donc les fin de semaines il faut r√©server √† l'avance et annuler derni√®re minute quand on en a pas besoin, sinon c'est juste impossible. Aussi, les mod√®les avec si√®ges de b√©b√© sont rares et c'est un chiare de les installer et d√©sinstaller chaque fois...
I find if you camp and refresh throughout the course of a day you can find something relatively easily.   
I've had decent success with people cancelling or literally Communauto adding new cars into the system and snagging them as they show up.   
I drive maybe once a month though and usually know well ahead of time when I will need the car so I'm one of those snagging the Saturday reservations a month-ahead .
It's basically Bixi with cars, except that you can park anywhere within the service range and in a legal parking spot, including residential parking zones.
Given how many people live on the plateau (and don't have cars as compared to the rest of Montreal) the service is somewhat lacking for the ideal core customer base.
Yup. √áa veut dire que les usagers du Plateau (et de mon coin, Rosemont!) prennent un char le matin pour sortir du quartier et ne les ram√®nent pas toujours dans le quartier d'origine, ou bien vont le ramener plus tard en fin de journ√©e.
Sans avoir √©cout√© tout le vid√©o... Je m'en excuse.
 N'est ce pas exactement le mod√®le de Communauto? Sauf pour les cargo vans. Les Communauto en station doivent d√©j√† √™tre retourn√© la o√π elle sont prises.
It is. :)
It is!
J'ai malheureusement peur que, encore aujourd'hui, pour plusieurs, bilingue veut dire que les francophones doivent apprendre l'anglais pour √©viter que d'autres apprennent le fran√ßais au Qu√©bec.
Comme dit mon ami qui travaille au gouvernement du Canada :"il existe deux langues officielles au gouvernement du Canada, l'anglais et ses traductions"
Again does the Free and Independent Republic of Beaconsfield bravely defend itself against tyrannical and opressive attacks by the government of Quebec. Bravo!
Good. Montr√©al and it's suburbs are bilingual cities, time they stood up for it.
Relisez l‚Äôarticle lu lisez l‚Äôarticle si vous ne l‚Äôavez pas fait. Beaconsfield applique une disposition de la loi 96 i.e. affirmer que la ville est bilingue pour que celle-ci soit consid√©r√©e comme bilingue et non pas comme unilingue fran√ßaise  avant que la Loi 96 change la status des villes a unilingue fran√ßaise. 
Beaconsfield play the game according to the new law. 
Inspirez, expirerez, inspirez, expirez. Relire l‚Äôarticle, r√©fl√©chir, relire l‚Äôarticle, comprendre l‚Äôarticle.
Yes, the new language bill allows them to do this under its explicit provisions and protections for majority anglophone communities?
What a bizarre article and headline.
ils pourraient renommer la ville en "Champs du Beacon" ou "Balise Field" pour √™tre bilingue. /s
The big bad "West-Island" - where all the evil English people dwell. I already knew the comments would be toxic. Montreal is a bilingual city - Bonjour/Hi.
We're not talking about Rouyn-Noranda here.. Beaconsfield is a community with a large Anglophone population. I see no problem with a bilingual community reaffirming their bilingual status
This is getting scarier every day. We have done so much for the French language here in Qu√©bec. Bill C-96 is only to appease French only speakers.
I spoke French at home when I was a kid, and I still speak French with my parents. I went to school in French up to CEGEP where I went to Champlain College in Lennoxville. I did my University in French, but funnily enough, the only good books were in English.
I am bilingual and I feel very offended every time someone tries to tell me otherwise.
The 2021 CENSUS is a very good exemple of that.
La population de Beaconsfield est [majoritairement anglophone](http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/MTL_STATS_FR/MEDIA/DOCUMENTS/PROFIL_SOCIOD%C9MO_BEACONSFIELD%202016.PDF) (voir page 17). 
C'est donc normal qu'elle veuille pr√©server ses droit d'affichage en anglais.
french should be more supportive of someone learning their language
Le fait nous avons une deuxieme langue comme cours a partir de la premiere annee jusqu'au secondaire 5 et que ya encore du monde qui on pas une base minimal est carr√©ment pathetic.
Ce cours a tjs √©t√© trait√© comme une p√©riode "free for all."
What a refreshing informative article that is factual and not opinionated or biased. 
Anyone who would know: does billingual status in any way hurt residents? So long as services are being offered fully in french (in every sense of the word service), why is the provincial government interfering?
Pointe-Claire did this too but Beaconsfield is always an easy shaming target somehow.
That‚Äôs not news lol
Bilingue!!!!!!!!!
Juste se faire servir en francais dans certains commerce de Beaconsfield est un chemin de croix.
Il reste l√† beaucoup d'unilingues Anglophones qui ont rien √† foutre du francais.

Baeconsfield  bilingue lol, en voila une bonne.
I grew up in the West Island.  I hate going back there.
> Comme dit mon ami qui travaille au gouvernement du Canada :"il existe deux langues officielles au gouvernement du Canada, l'anglais et ses traductions" 
C'est un peu dr√¥le consid√©rant qu'une pourcentage disproportionn√©e des fonctionnaires sont des francophones (parce qu'ils exigent le bilinguisme)
Pourquoi c‚Äôest downvot√©? C‚Äôest litt√©ralement l‚Äôexp√©rience de tous les francophones qui doivent √©changer avec des Canadians/anglophones.
Les gens qui te n√©gavotent se voilent les yeux.
Dans les forces canadiennes le concept de respect de la langue parl√©e est important. Autrement dit, si un francophone veut √™tre trait√© en francais, les efforts sont entrepris pour quil le soit. Je dois ajouter que les francos sont disproportionnellement repr√©sent√©s dans les FAC.
That makes sense, since only about 20% of the population speaks French, and less than half speaks only French (and not English). Where English is about 90% of the population.
So as a government, it would be strange of your representatives speak a different language than that of the people that are represented.
Plus if you ever have to do business in North America, your better off speaking Spanish (20%) then French (under 5%), where almost everyone speaks English (over 80%).
C'est pour √ßa que le Gov't du Qu√©bec et le Bloc devraient promouvoir et d√©fendre le fran√ßais dans le reste du pays. Au lieu de √ßa, ils sabotent les initiatives pour les droits des minorit√©s francophones par peur que √ßa aide la minorit√© anglophone ici.
I don't even know if thats a joke at this point
T'as tu lu la loi 96? Il y des bouts assez discriminatoires l√† dedans. Comme la p√©nalisation des employ√©s qui essaient d'aider quelqu'un en anglais. 
J'en ai marre du "racisme du petit" village de ce gouvernement. Les foulards des infirmi√®res musulmanes, maintenant p√©naliser les vieux qui n'ont pas la m√™me connaissance du fran√ßais vs leurs enfants. La plupart des gens anglophones unilingues sont des immigr√©s qui ont du travailler, car ils avaient des enfants, et ils n'ont jamais obtenu la connaissance de qualit√© du fran√ßais. Leurs enfants sont toujours bilingues par contre.
Je sais que c'est chiant de devoir se conformer pour une minorit√© de citoyens francophones √† Beaconsfield, mais ils n'ont qu'√† acquiescer √† la loi simplement pour la forme sans n√©cessairement changer  la pratique.
Dans les faits, pas du tout. Le pourcentage anglophone (natifs) est consid√©rablement plus bas que celui pour l'allophonie, pour la francophonie c'est encore plus loin. Ce qui donne l'impression de "villes bilingues", c'est que l'attraction en tant que langue commune de l'anglais chez les allophones est compl√®tement disproportionn√©e par rapport √† l'attrait du fran√ßais comme langue commune.
Si par Montr√©al and its suburbs, tu parles du West Island, oui, sinon, pas du tout. 
Dans ma banlieue, la premi√®re fois que j'ai entendu de l'anglais dans les rues, c'√©tait il y a 2 ans.
Pas vrai du tout.
Justement, le probl√®me n'est pas Beaconsfield mais la loi 96
What's bizarre is that in a period when there's plenty of things to fix after the pandemic, mini-Duplessis is concentrating on restricting the language of study of CEGEP students. Because that and 3 Muslim women wearing a headscarf is the biggest problems Quebec is facing. The government's management of CHSLD's cost the lives of a few thousand seniors but they would have gladly given their lives to know that Quebec has a distinct society status now.

What specific actions do you think would be supportive?
Lmao l‚Äôironie d‚Äô√©crire √ßa en anglais
fran√ßais langue seconde?
Not one of my French teachers in my highschool years were Qu√©becois. I had 2 Hatian teachers, 1 Morroccon, 1 Vietnamese, and an Algerian. The heavy unfamiliar accents made understanding and learning very tough.
Je sais pas comment c‚Äôest aujourd‚Äôhui, mais c‚Äô√©tait pas mal la m√™me chose avec les cours d‚Äôanglais seconde langue dans les √©coles francophones quand j‚Äô√©tais l√†. Le gros avantage c‚Äôest la culture populaire et les gros m√©dias am√©ricains. Les Filles de Caleb √ßa m‚Äôint√©ressais pas trop quand j‚Äô√©tais jeune ado.
Je suis d'accord. Mais  je ne suis pas certain quel cours vous parlez.
Les services gouvernementaux en anglais contribuent √† rendre l'apprentissage du fran√ßais facultatif. Une langue est un outil: si tu en a pas *besoin*, tu ne vas pas l'apprendre.
Des r√©sidents qui sont incapables de communiquer dans la langue de la soci√©t√© sont isol√©s et pas int√©gr√©s, ce qui est n√©faste pour la soci√©t√© et, √† mon avis, √©galement pour eux.
Pointe-Claire has a french name so they are not picked up by the language police as easily.  Same with Baie D'urfe which no one actually ever proncounces it in French even though they spell it with an accent on the e.
Yup, c'est ce que les anglos pensent.

Another point, if you have a telescopic pole to clean your roof, watch out for your power lines.
Also...don't do it from a ladder...
Also... don't stand under the snow.

So I suppose this is the best thread to ask this...
My gf and I live on the 3rd floor of one of those apartments in Verdun where it's like 6 apartments in one housing block. The Balcony honestly doesn't seem like it could handle much more snow. We really want to shovel it to prevent any kind of accidents, but we can't just throw the snow off our balcony as it would block other tenant's doors, and we have some extremely vocal neighbors who will likely complain. Does anyone have any suggestions or experiences on how to go about this?
bonne id√©e merci!
Je suis couvreur et je garantis que depuis dimanche, les toits r√©sidentiels (bardeau) coule en masse !! Les digues de glace retienne l‚Äôeau jusqu‚Äô√† ce que l‚Äôeau remonte pass√© la membrane autocollante d‚Äôavant toit.
A guy got pretty badly hurt on the weekend trying to cope with a Tempo full of snow in Ste-Th√©r√®se:
https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1772401/accident-tempo-blesse-grave-hopital-sainte-therese
So I have a two story flat roof house in ville emard, and a 30 foot ladder to get on top. You really think this is a necessary thing to do?
[deleted]
My roof isn't insulated. I wonder if there's much left up there at this point ü§î   
Anyone have a drone I could borrow? Lol
THISSSS!! i'm always amazed by how few people bother to clear snow off of their homes and then wonder why their balconies have a tilt
d√©neigez*
Bon point!
J‚Äôai des gros probl√®me de glace et fonte de neige dans un de mes blocs. Les goutti√®res sont bloqu√©es et l‚Äôeau s‚Äôinfiltre par les balcons vers un appartement, c‚Äôest l‚Äôenfer!!!
With a flat roof with central drain is it still necessary? I've heard it's not, but I am not sure I understand it!
This.
Such a smart and relevant PSA... I've got a steep / flat'ish roof combo that causes ice dams and leaks and have been doing this solo - steel roof 15-18 feet off ground - without sufficient passive restraints.. or none.
But .. it's absolutely important to do this sooner rather than later... the roof will just get heavier and heavier and with larger ice dams.
Soyez vigilant pour les lignes √©lectriques - et surtout votre s√©curit√© physique sur le toit - ... take a cell phone in a secure pocket, tell someone you're going up and how long you expect to stay and...  take breaks shovelling to oxygenate and protect your heart!  
If you can - hire, invite or negotiate help to it alone if at all for the moral support never mind the security perspective!
j'habite dans un 6 logements ah 3iem etage et il y a 5 buildings identiques un a cot√© de l'autres. a part moi et mon voisin de balcon , les 4 autres balcons on pas deneg√© une seul fois. c'est tous des balcons qui se tenu par le mur de brique et aucun soutien en dessous. J'ai ben hate de voir si ils vont tenir üòê
Oui et un autre point c'est que le syst√®me du 3-4 Mars semble √™tre bien neigeux donc c'est important de le faire le plus t√¥t possible.
I must be the only person in my apartment building who shovels snow off the balcony so...if there's a fire, everyone can pass through my 5th floor apartment balcony door to get on the fireman's ladder!ü§î
Absolutely. Just did it this weekend, there was about 45cm of snow near the drain (low point = most room for accumulation). And it was fairly dense too, not the nice fluffy stuff. 
It's no joke, this is probably more snow than your roof is designed for unless it's a fairly big building (structural engineer, AMA... tl;dr this is more snow than specified by Part 9 of the building code). With a bunch of rain it definitely will be.
How concerned should I be about this if my condo building is fairly new (2014-2015)?
[deleted]
Oui, d√©finitivement, toujours √™tre √† deux au moins pour faire cette job, ou bien engagez des professionnels pour le faire √† votre place.
This. Toujours enlever la neige sur les rebords de fenetre sinon ca fait un "effet tablette" qui la fait fondre, et l'eau s'infiltre.
Maison, apt, condo, wtv. Do it. Aauve sur le bill d'hydro parce que tu reste bien isol√©, pas de moisissure ni humidit√© en dedans.
Ya le pas√≥ al m√≠o y d√©jame decirte que no es agradable.
Appeler des professionnels si c‚Äôest trop dangereux de le faire vous m√™me. Tu peux me contacter directement si tu le souhaites, on s‚Äôen charge.
Bring it into the bathtub and let it melt
If you can, shovel the snow off from the balcony and immediately go downstairs to cleanup the snow that may have gone in front of your neighbours doors.
One of you go down to "direct traffic" while the other one shovels. Then clear the snow out of any paths that it lands on.
Tbh if it's not super densely-packed and there's a bit of a breeze, you can often just throw shovelfuls off and they'll dissipate in the wind and just kinda fall to the ground like a flurry.
(Maybe test this with a small shovelful before you start just pouring it down on your neighbors.)
I would talk to the other tenants, explain the situation.  Better to have some snow fall down than an entire balcony
Tell your neighbors to fuck off?
This is the most libertarian shit I've read today.
"I need to shovel my stairs, but I don't want to shovel anyone else's stuff, so what can I do?"
UHhhhhh, just shovel the the mess you make, LOL
I was actually so annoyed at my mom for always making me shovel our path twice (once. then she'd make the snow fall off the tempo roof onto the path. shovel a 2nd time).
Upon a google research, found out Tempo brand Tempos recommend to remove the snow every day. dang it, she was right. -\_-
Guys, shovel your tempos.
If you can do it safely, yes, absolutely
[deleted]
Also who can I call? I can't even get up onto my roof because of how stupidly the balconies are made.
Same here! No insulation and I‚Äôm wondering too! With all the experts here I hope we can get an answer! Can‚Äôt even climb up there myself!
Your roof isn't insulated? At all?
Mes goutti√®res sont gel√©es solide aussi :(
It most definitely is. :) No matter how great your drain is, it can't drain the crazy amount of snow we've had.   
Source: century-old house with a flat roof and central drain. All of my roof has leaked through the years, espc. when there's big snowfalls + snow melts later on.

Interesting view.  Looks like it could be a set from a sci-fi movie.

Can you walk through the middle part of it yet? Having such a wide open space in the city will be huge.
3 weeks ago it was still thick snow covered.... I was there, on some paths I stumped half my leg in to the snow if not careful
Does anyone know the date by which it should be fully open??
Also, I saw a couple of turkey vultures there last year. Has anyone else seen em?
The middle part was open for a while but they closed it off in September I think. Those umbrella things are new I don't know why they put them up they are useful (not next to picnic tables).
Really cool parc. It's my go to bike ride.
looks like a colony on an alien planet
This man gets it
I hope they fill the pit with water.

Je marche le parc dans son enti√®ret√© deux fois par jour depuis le d√©but de la pandemie. J'pense pas que t'√©tait sur un sentier p√©destre mais plut√¥t sur une track de skidoo.

Dans les deux cas ils sont th√©oriquement ouverts pour le ski de fond et pas gratt√© comme le reste.
it's as if snow disappears somehow
Yes! I saw one turkey vulture most weeks on my Sunday morning long run, it tends to hang out near the south west corner of the park. Haven't seen it yet this year. I've only ever seen one at a time so I'm assuming it's always the same individual, would be cool of there was a mated couple raising chicks though!
I also heard the coyotes once, though I never actually saw them (thankfully, no idea what I would do if I came face to face with one)!
2026 apparently!
The pit is huge, There will be a lake within it! I think north west corner, near the stadium.
Username checks out.
Thanks! I can't wait!

Chicago is actually not in the top 20 cities in the US for per-capita murder . It's just the largest city with a high rate.

I would be mad tho paying a frog half a billion
Canadian gun laws aren't that great , registering guns is absolutely stupid and there should be more check ups on people before allowing them to buy and use guns. As a hunter since i was a kid , i am well educated about guns and think that if more people were , the fear of guns would be much lesser. A sharp knife is as dangerous as a gun , sorry not sorry
this chart was created for /r/Mls for fun.
It was shared elsewhere after.
It's a completely arbitrary selection, and it happens to be one that excludes the five worst cities in the US.
In a couple of years, St Louis will be added to that list, and their #1 rate of 66/100k would be quite an outlier.
Of course these rates aren't really comparable anyway, since they're using municipal boundaries where some cities include huge suburban sprawl and others are limited to the city core.
It‚Äôs one of the reasons I love traveling to Montreal.  It just seems safe.  
The people of Montreal deserve a lot of credit for this too.

No, a knife, sharp or not, is not as dangerous as a gun. You can't be serious.
>A sharp knife is as dangerous as a gun
Have you ever heard the saying "don't bring a knife to gunfight"?
Ha, that makes sense in the context.
I suspect this is part of why Canadian cities are at the bottom. The Mtl and Toronto municipalities comprise more outlying suburban areas than their American equivalent which drops statistical crimes rates, since those areas are low-crime.
Le r√©sultat serait probablement similaire avec une comparaison des aires m√©tropolitaines, mais l'√©cart serait peut-√™tre monis grand.

Yeah, except if you‚Äôre an expert knife thrower that can throw over 100m.
I'd have to find the article but about 4years ago there was a guy in a subway in London that stabbed about 30 people before people started noticing , believe me , you'd need only one gun shot for everybody to know what's happening , now come tell me you can't make as much damage with a knife. 
Also , i am very serious , thanks for asking.
I know it feels that way and it sucks if you got your bike stolen, but it's much better than in other cities.  
In Vancouver you'd have to be crazy to leave your bike chained on downtown, and in Winnipeg you'd never leave your bike outside at night, it'd probably not see the light of day. A friend once got his bike stolen from a garage, and another one had hers stolen from a *balcony* over there. 
Meanwhile over here the Plateau is filled with bikes sleeping outside, you see them all over the place.
Yes.  I know.  Someone tried to take my bike but they couldn‚Äôt get past the lock.  Probably didn‚Äôt have the time for the next step.  
Hopefully technology will get involved someday with some kind of embedded chip to find bikes.  Idk
In London people inject glue into your bike lock so you can't take it away.  Then they come back at night and steal it.
lol.

J'avais quelques livres que j'avais oubli√© de retourner √† la biblioth√®que d'Outremont  j'avais tellement peur de les retourner et de me faire chicaner et de me faire demander de l'argent que j'ai arr√™t√© d'y aller!! :-D
There is an increasingly large movement in the Library systems in the US and Canada to eliminate late fees in order to encourage usage (c.f.: [https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/libraries-late-fees-1.5919483](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/libraries-late-fees-1.5919483) ).  
The idea being that some low-income users who get dinged one-time may be hesitant to return. Moreover, fees don't account for that much of a library system's revenue.
Ah, je me rappelle aller chercher des livres √† la biblioth√®que du C√âGEP et me faire dire que je devais 20 sous lol
article en fran√ßais ici : https://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2021/06/30/les-bibliotheques-de-montreal-eliminent-les-frais-de-retards-1
I am perfectly content with being unopinionated about this.
Im still waiting for one library card for all libraries
Is it that hard to return a book?
Anyone ever had dreams where they had a bunch of content they forgot to return to the library for a very long time?
Going the Blockbuster way it seems.
[deleted]
Don‚Äôt libraries use the late fees to help support themselves?
Why? They‚Äôre just never going to get the books back. 
I grew up in the damn ghetto. Do they not know people from the ghetto? I know some people who, even after getting out of the ghetto and doing well for themselves, still buy clothes they can‚Äôt afford, keep the tags on, wear them out, then return it the next day to take advantage of lax return policies.
This is just going to make our libraries devoid of books and more expensive to maintain due to replacement costs.
This doesn‚Äôt serve the poor. This serves the dishonourable amongst the population.
La biblioth√®que Ahuntsic m'accusait d'√™tre responsable d'une tache d'encre sur un livre de Jules Verne. J'√©tais intimid√© et j'ai arr√™t√© d'y aller. L'article ne parle pas de ce genre de situation.
C'est exactement une des raisond pourquoi on devrait abolir les frais de retard !
Haha moi aussi. Et j'avais fait des calculs pour d√©terminer mes frais de retard et je m'√©tais probablement tromp√© en quelque part parce que √ßa me donnait genre 75$ de frais et quand t'es un kid de 8-9 ans, c'est une estie de fortune. Finalement c'√©tait genre plutot 2-3$..
That's me. I have a 40$ late-fee. Kept a few books for a couple extra weeks. Seems pretty ridiculous to charge people late-fees when they can just renew their books online.
Starts running out of the library
My first reaction was that this makes no sense but then I have no arguments either. On either side. So yeah I'll stay unopinionated for now.

But they were deceived all of them, for one library card was made to rule them all....
It's already the case...
Yes. I have no legs.
Yeah sometimes
Omg yes. My worst nightmare. Glad I'm not alone.
More like the Netflix way. Online catalog from libraries are super useful.
If everyone does that, libraries might go extinct and that would be a damn shame.
I hope not. That would be like having roads financed on speed tickets.
you would need a lot of late fees to buy 1 book.
I think we have reached the point where the dishonorable don't often bother setting foot in a library.

Still isn't any harder to return a book than it was to check it out in the first place.
username checks out esp if at a home library.
Oh wait‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
Well, it's not the same network. But if you have a Biblioth√®que de Montr√©al card, you have access to all the libraries in the city.
Doubles my legless work
True! Thanks for this tip. When did they change it? For the longest time Ive had one card at the banq, one for the cavendish ndg library and one on the south shore but none would work at other spots
I'm not sure exactly! I'm just glad I can easily borrow a book from any library and it's delivered at my local one.
Could be said about every product ever. 
But yeah‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve always felt the vibe in MTL has shifted to luxury appearances as a status symbol even for those who don‚Äôt even have a lot of money. Fashion, cars, restaurants, condos, etc.
The builders are simply supplying the demand.
Does anyone actually have evidence that these new condos are built poorly? It always comes up in the comments but I've not heard anything reliable about it.
Montr√©al has become the French Toronto. And we‚Äôve become just as materialistic as them and just as narcissistic. I blame social meeja.
I always wonder who are the people living there? As part of a young couple shopping for condos I‚Äôve been to many showrooms for these buildings. The costs just don‚Äôt justify the size and space
Les acheteurs doivent se dire "tant qu'√† payer 400k et plus pour rester sur l'√Æle, aussi bien se payer un peu de luxe"
Condos that the majority can't afford.
So what? Are you expecting them to work the other way around and make then as uncool as possible? I don‚Äôt get it.
How can everybody in this subreddit complain about rent/housing prices and new development of housing at the same time? Guys *more supply=lower prices* more condos is a good thing for the average person!
They can market them as luxury all they like, if they flood the market with luxury to the point that they can't fill their buildings, the price for that caliber of apartment will go down which will push down the price for all tiers of condos.
And the good old 'luxury' aka cheap cheap shiny stuff, done by the cheapest bidder using the cheapest materials so maximum profit for the developer! And you get a beautiful view for a month until they build another condo building 10 meters away from your window.
I think the worst part is seeing said condos empty at night , just sitting there as a foreign investment or to launder money , which then drives prices up and makes it harder for the average Montrealer to find a decent living place .
A good thing. Densification.
Well this was a useless rant. Of course you wanna stand out as an architect. Or are you just expecting all of them to follow the same prototype, design and  be just plain unoriginal?
*"Montreal is over!"*
Moi je vois √ßa comme une bonne nouvelle, la comp√©tition peut entrainer une meilleure qualit√© architecturale.

I wish they would still build simple, normal condos that we can actually afford. I don't want a gym or a pool or a security guard at the door...üôÑ
went to look the Gasby tower website and it so funny. They really trying to selll you a lifestyle. They said something like ;Relive the legend ! Like wtf does that mean ? Im looking for a nice place to tay with nice amenty like Greenspace , Pool etc not reliving the book ?!? Anyways it start at 600k BuT tHeiR iS a bAr In The BuILdINg !
I've always wondered what kind of jobs people have to be able to afford 4-500k+ condos. The average salary in Qc is between 58-75k ([https://statistique.quebec.ca/fr/document/revenu-moyen-a-lechelle-du-quebec/tableau/revenu-moyen-revenu-apres-impot-menages-quebec](https://statistique.quebec.ca/fr/document/revenu-moyen-a-lechelle-du-quebec/tableau/revenu-moyen-revenu-apres-impot-menages-quebec)) 
Let's say you are lucky and you are in a relationship and both of you earn 75k each, you're in your late 20's, early 30's, still clearing up student debts, haven't really had the time to stash money in your RRSP, savings, etc because you're just starting out in life, graduating at around 22-ish. 
How do you afford that condo? You don't, unless you're fortunate enough that your parents can maybe chip in. So you try to find something outside of Montreal, which is a bit cheaper but that's not true anymore with the bidding wars. 
I just saw a small town house for sale in Laval, asking 100 000$ over the city evaluation. And you know what? At 355 000$ it's probably going to sell for a higher price because people are insane and bidding blindly.
And here I am, single, late 30's, trying to buy something and I'm pretty much screwed. Add that dating in the LGBTQ+ community is already hard, it's pretty much impossible during a pandemic. I'm going to die alone in a 1 bedroom apartment that is overpriced lol
It's part of the game. In places where increasing density is political torture, the only time the money is there is when there is demand for luxury units which they can sell for massive markups. So they add some pointless bells and whistles, charge way more for it, and the rich people eat it up. In the process, the places they leave end up worth less. That's why today's midrange apartment and condos buildings are often 10-30 year old luxury buildings.
If the process sounds filled with flaws, that's because it is. But until some combination of the following happens:
1) Developers are allowed to build enough luxury buildings to saturate that market
2) The market speculation is reigned in
3) There are government incentives provided to make building cheaper units more profitable
4) We stop being capitalist
They will continue to maximize profit.
Used to work in security for these type of buildings. Its not for us peasants. Its for people like Saputo and his family.
when i saw they're building a new hood with 12stories buildings in Hochelaga i thought just like you....
If all condos are luxury, none of them are.
I love how it seems that every new condo project is always winning the 'best new project' award or something awarded by some random entity
> best and the coolest condo building in town
1. The coolest building in town will never be a luxury condo building. They're for basic people with simplistic aspirations.
2. The best building in town will never be a luxury condo building, because, objectively, the best building in town will always be one that has a soul.
More accurately, it's a contest between different developers to see who can hire the best marketing team to convince basic people that their mass-produced human filing cabinet is a status symbol worth paying for.
It's a dick measuring contest where people make millions of dollars, whether they win or lose. If I'm invited to participate, I'd be unbuttoning my pants in no time.
What irks me the most is when developers advertise some as luxury condos when it's no really different from a regular condo... only difference being like the quartz countertop in the kitchen and slightly prettier tiles in the bathroom but hey im gonna sell that shit for 100k more expensive.
Well since you are paying anywhere between 550$ and 1000$ per square foot (Sometimes more for penthouses), they need to brand their product as a luxury or at east a upscale lifestyle item.
Its less about the developer and more about the people they want to sell too : people who pay a million bucks for a downtown condo built essentially the same way than any other condo need it to feel special a bit, and when the quartz backspash isn‚Äôt enough then you need to make it pop a bit outside too.
I mean, its the same as driving a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù car really, its 25% quality-performance and 75% status symbol. Its not just about showing off to others, its also the image it reflects back at you (essentially, success)
In that sense yes its an ego thing.
This comment section is an prime example of the echo chamber effect
They are so god damn ugly. I was just near rouge condos next to Namur. I wanted to throw up
It's just marketing bro.  That's what they do.
What I'm surprised about is how nobody seems to question the fact that 80%+ of these new developments are all "luxury" developments. After a while that word starts to no longer mean anything..
It is a cockfight. I know a few people that work/worked at the biggest Montreal condo dev shops in the investment team and it‚Äôs really a fight for the tallest condo building. Mine is bigger than yours...
Some of the condos I see have \*amazing\* view, but absolutely no where to put a TV; so people end up putting their TVs in front of the window.
> these developments like 90% about them **making money**
**\^** Fixed it for you.
It's a luxury condo.  Nothing in my mind screams style over substance more than that.  Looking at practicality in a luxury condo is like buying a BMW for reliability.
Je suis d‚Äôaccord, ces condos ne repr√©sentent pas ce que la majorit√© de la population m√©tropolitaine a besoin, des logements assez grands, durables, modestes et moins cher. Pas du criss du luxe.
> The builders are simply supplying the demand.
yup.
Just go back 30 years ago, driving as BMW or a Mercedes meant you were a rich person... nowadays, the streets are flooded with mercedes and BMW's... are they cheaper? NO!  are the people richer? NO.
The difference is that they finance you this car over 10 years, so it looks easy on payments.
we are a consuming society, what once was a family of 7-8 children is no longer because the newer generation of parents 1) both work 2) live above their budget 3) want to have 2 weeks down south every year...
The line ups are bigger at the apple store when a new iPhone comes out tahn the lineup at Pop's
> I‚Äôve always felt the vibe in MTL has shifted to luxury 
if you've always felt that way, then how recent can this shift have been
Well at the end of the day, people take what's available. And the developers decide what to make available to people. After a while, expectations take shape and I suppose so does demand. But it's the developers themselves who laid the blueprint for the modern condo development, not the consumers themselves.
Toronto culture oozing into Montreal.
Maybe it's the anglicization of the city. As it becomes more anglophone, more people who'd live in Toronto come here for cheaper rent.
It's not "proof" of anything, but I can say anecdotally that I work in the Montreal construction industry, including some condo projects, and depending on your definitions of poorly built there's a strong case to be made that they're poorly *designed*.
I can't really speak to the fundamentals of poor construction (I'm a landscape architect/urban designer, not a builder/architect) but I get to see the process, speak with the clients, project managers and internal stakeholders, and I am privy to what developers value and what they don't.
What that has taught me is that for many of these urban condo projects, developers are selling an idea much more than they're selling a reality. They are squeezing every cent of profit out of those builds, and they do it in a variety of ways. That includes preparing sales material with graphics which show one outcome, only to enact cost cutting measures afterwards which reduce the quality of the final product (removing amenities like planting, outdoor space etc, swapping out expensive materials for low cost, low quality replacements), allowing practical concerns like mechanical equipment to dictate the design of user spaces and not the other way around... the list of minor moves which all add up to a final product of severely reduced quality is long and diverse.
While building regulations and zoning aren't always good (they can be too rigid, stifle creative development etc), these rules, along with regulatory boards like the CCUs are often the only tools that designers can use to maintain quality control in their work. Because generally we're a part of a design team who genuinely wants to do good work. But when your client has absolutely no pretenses of anything other than selling residential units for the maximum dollars per square metre rate, every single line item is fair game for cost cutting and it is a real challenge to deliver developments that actually have a standard of quality to them.
(And when it comes to caring at all about the impact of these developments on the urban fabric of the neighbourhoods they're built in, well that's even worse)
I have a friend who does building inspections. He likes to take me on walks and point out how sloppily built some newer buildings are. Just little details, things that the casual observer wouldn't notice. A brick slightly out of place, hand railing not aligned perfectly. Once you notice you can see it everywhere.
Plumber in Montreal here. I do mainly service work like repairs and such. I can tell you firsthand that many many newer buildings are built so quickly that the majority of the finishes are sloppy at best. The materials are extremely cheap, especially the plumbing fixtures. There are condos with $30k bathroom setups that are using no-name 'designer' faucets and showers that are almost impossible to find parts for and almost always need to be replaced entirely as soon as an issue comes up. 
For example, there is a Condo building in Saint-Laurent that I work in often. It's not even 10 years old and I already had to change many faucets out. And the building is designed without a 'booster' pump in the basement to increase the pressure coming in from the city. City pressure(approximately 50-60 psi) is enough to get to 4 floors, even after 3 its a very good idea to have a booster pump to provide adequate water to higher floors. This building has 6 floors and a 2 floor garage, so the owner of the penthouse on the top floor has so little water pressure that his giant 10'x10' "luxury" shower with a no-name faucet can't even spray water to the middle of the shower. I've unblocked his drains at least 3x in the past 3 years because there is simply not enough water to properly clean the drains of soap, grime, food scraps, etc. Not to mention his bathroom windows don't seal properly so there is a massive draft. Not to mention the giant tiles that aren't well done, if you can hear an empty noise when knocking your tools on your tiles (and there are differences in sound when you hit different tiles) the job is not well done. Sometimes I'm actually afraid to crack a tile they seem to be so poorly put in.
Another pet peeve, is this new trend of having very dimly lit hallways with dark paint. I work with a headlamp, and as soon as most of those hallways have a light shined in them you would be surprised how many spots are missing paint, trim moulding, etc that you don't see because of the poor lighting.
I had friend who bought one and he and the whole condo where in several battles to fix everything. It finally got all done but it took a few years and a lof of stress and shit.
He's happy now but it's not something I would want to go through with.
Luxury is style, not quality. The difference in cost between building a regular condo and a luxury condo is almost negligible, so the cheapest trim that can pass as luxury is what anybody trying to make money will use.
[deleted]
I only have anecdotes.. I'm also curious if there are any datasets or similar systematic surveys about repairs etc. I've rented 3 condos downtown/Griffintown over 6 years and they were all trash. Cheap appliances (and utilities like AC) that break down after a couple of years, floor joints start coming undone, weird loud noises emanating from the walls and ceilings, poor sealing around the windows, janky patio doors, actual doors that don't fit or close properly, very cheap closet rails etc. Maybe I was just unlucky, but overall I'm very unimpressed with the quality of housing in Montreal.
It takes a few years for those deficiencies to be provable against a developer.
If you think Canadian developers are special that is fine, otherwise google "Australia Meriton" to see your future. I was stuck in montreal during the first 6 months of the pandemic. I looked at stuff and yeah you guys have your own versions of "meriton companies" and they are a few years into the process I'd guess. In 10 they'll be in court.
What kind of evidence are you looking for?
 The stuff I notice is somewhat like the stuff you notice going from a German luxury car to an American one- uneven gaps in decorative panels, rapid wear, and designs that look terrible once worn slightly or dirty. Is
 It's like they managed to capture the dispose-ability of a cell phone in a home.
I would assume Montreal has a reputation for poor infrastructure. We also have a reputation for some pretty note worthy and impressive infrastructure. I guess people wouldn‚Äôt be wrong to assume some of the new condo projects are poorly built without evidence. It‚Äôs Montreal, don‚Äôt need more evidence than that.

Je me demande comment √ßa fonctionnerait pour la p√©riode de 15-30 min d'attente apr√®s. Par exemple, j'ai fait un choc vagal quelques minutes apr√®s avoir re√ßu mon vaccin et j'ai eu quelques secondes pour r√©agir et dire √† la madame qui surveillait que je faisais un choc vagal et que j'avais besoin d'aide. Si j'avais √©t√© seule dans un v√©hicule j'aurais juste pass out, je n'aurais pas √©t√© capable d'ouvrir la porte pour aller chercher de l'aide. J'imagine qu'ils vont faire attendre les personnes non accompagn√©es dans une aire commune?
I'm glad they are finally doing that! Already got my vaccine but it's good! I do wonder what they have in place to avoid ppl trying to get their second dose by re-registering 3 weeks later.

On rit mais jai d√©ja parlott√© avec les b√©n√©voles de h√©ma qu√©bec et sa lair longtemps comme ti snack de apr√®s don de sang yavait une shot de boisson.
Si vous avez jamais pris une biere apres un don la biere slap 2x plus hard d√©ja, mais la ils ten donnaient et fallait tu conduise pour revenir? Quelle id√©e!
Ils devraient faire √ßa avec des guns √† tranquilisants, comme pour endormir les ours dans le royaume des animaux de la mutuelle d'Omaha. Ils pourraient donner de la job aux snipers des forces arm√©es canadiennes et on aurait m√™me pas besoin de ralentir. Roule en camisole, d√©sinfecte ton √©paule avec du Purell, pis Pow! Vaccin√©!
Tu te stationne dans une zone designer et tu attend le 15 minute avant de partir?
Faut juste stationner et attendre. J'imagine qu'ils auront des pr√©pos√©s ou infermi√®res qui surveilleront tout le monde.
Le stationnement a une capacit√© d'envirron 2000 espaces alors √ßa ne va pas √™tre surcharg√© l√†.
Au US, si tu sens des effets n√©gatifs, ils demande que tu flashe tes lumi√®res. Sinon, apr√®s 15 mins tu repart apr√®s une attente dans une zone apart
Same as any other vax clinic, I would think.
Il y a un registre informatis√© de vaccinations au Qu√©bec.
Sur la 40 m√©tropolitaine aussi
"Votre 2e dose : dans 6 semaines, m√™me endroit et m√™me heure."
Technically I think all of the current ones are walk-through.
*grape
Non ca va etre les nonion ring
Absolument.
Les moeurs des autres temps... quand m√™me cocasse!
Ohhh faudrait que j‚Äôessaie! Mais en uber apr√®s bien s√ªr lol
C'√©tait l'id√©e de Jean-Ren√© Dufort!
https://ici.tou.tv/infoman/S21E09?lectureauto=1 (√† 10m28s, apr√®s les publicit√©s)
Ouais, c‚Äôest comme √ßa au US. Si tu sens des effets n√©gatifs, ils demande que tu flashe tes lumi√®res. Sinon, apr√®s 15 mins tu repart
ou voyage normalement √† Laval vers 14:30.
Si ils faisaient √ßa au circuit Gilles Villeneuve, on pourrait faire des laps en attendant.
Et si tu es en train de regarder une reprise de l'heure JMP tu fais quoi?
Ah c'est une bonne id√©e!
"La 2e dose est disponible seulement sur decarie. D√©sol√©"
And bike too ..if you can find a post or something
Jvais aller me faire vacciner plusieurs fois en citant un autre grand homme: Sparce qu'ils donnent un beigne!
C'est malade! M√™me joke, m√™me r√©f√©rence! Je peux pas en vouloir √† quiconque de penser que j'ai plagi√© ma joke sur Infoman. Vous √™tes pas oblig√©s de me croire, mais c'est sorti tout seul hier soir.
> ils demande que tu flashe tes lumi√®res
Jean Marc Parent va le faire anyway
La 440 √† n‚Äôimporte quelle heure la semaine
T'explique √† quel point t'es brillant √† chaque infirmier qui vient te voir pour te demander ce qui cloche.
Alors tu as besoin d'une troisi√®me dose
And car too. You just have to park!
ils donnent des beignes???? je peux prendre un rendez-vous juste demain... mais la je suis impatient.
stationnement est gratuit en plus au stade olympique si tu y vas pour te faire vacciner
Wait so that's the same cop that said Covid is a hoax ?
Edit: a letter
J‚Äôaime pas que ce soit pr√©sent√© comme une question d‚Äôargent (¬´¬†seeking $275,000¬†¬ª), les gens pourraient s‚Äôarr√™ter √† la somme. Mais il a s√ªrement raison, j‚Äôesp√®re ne jamais √™tre arr√™t√© comme il l‚Äôa √©t√©.

When was the last time cops arrested a white person with this kind of exaggerated aggression?  Yet I bet I can find a list of stories of black and indigenous people being brutalized by cops.    Not all cops are racists about racists gravitate towards being cops - clearly, or there wouldn't be story after story after story of this kind of abuse.  Here's a survey of racist police violence compiled by the  Gazette.

Quebec has some of the most racist police in the country
[deleted]
Est ce qu'il le m√©ritait?
If you have nothing to hide, why don't you do as they say? Every video I see like this, they never want to comply so you get what you deserve.
Deserved 100%, listen to the cop and you avoid any issues. Act like a tough guy, well you get what you deserve. 
These people think they're above the law and try to act like hereos by going against the cops orders.
He can make any lawsuit he likes, he won‚Äôt win. While i don‚Äôt agree with the cop at all, if you keep questioning the cops and refusing to get out of the car when they ask, you bet your ass you‚Äôll get an ‚Äúentrave‚Äù charge. He‚Äôs lucky he didnt....
Too often, people try to play I know my rights, without even having a clue what your legal obligations/freedoms actually are. This guy was in the wrong, and so was the cop for his dealing of the situation. I say Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
Yup le policier du peuple
Officier de la paix ?! Ouf. Quelle ironie ! 
FFS 
"Raison de croire qu'il y a de la drogue dans l'auto"? 
Quelle raison? La couleur de leur peau ? 
√Ä la fin, ils avaient rien alors ils leur ont flanqu√© 1500$ en amendes pour manquement aux r√®gles de distanciation sociale. 
Genre de trucs qu'ils collent quand ils ont rien d'autre √† mettre. 
Ces policiers ternissent l'image de leur institution. Euros actions font honte a leur badge. Et malheureusement le syst√®me est tellement pourri que je ne crois pas sinc√®rement qu'il y aura justice dans ce cas.
Born and raised there .  Also working around police tech students and listening to their conversations.  That said it has improved considerably since the 90ties
wtf.
You‚Äôre full of shit. This cop is clearly in the wrong, and the guy is absolutely a victim of racism.
Ok Clan leader when‚Äôs the next meeting?
That doesn‚Äôt give a cop or anyone else the right to pull you by your hair.
Why was he in the wrong? Did he have to get out of the car?

I wanted to reply to a comment and posted it stand alone so I deleted the error comment and pasted its content on the right place
Stop it with this race shit, go ahead, act like a clown when being stopped, resist arrest, be uncooperative and you'll see what happens regardless of your race.

[deleted]
"A la fin ils avaient rien" refers to the fact that the entire arrest and search was based on the premise that they had "reason to believe there were drugs in the car". 
If the social distancing was the reason, they'd have said so in the first place. The way it all went down, it sounds like they had their target in mind already and were just trying to make something stick.
You should absolutely know your right in these type of situation.
To sit there and accept the wrongdoing of a cop is not ok. He was questioning the reason and they had nothing to give in return, which means cop provoked him for nothing/ or for racial reasons.
"In the constitution act, under the legal act; 9. Everyone has the right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned."
And no we have as much rights as the us.
And in this case, the cop was an anti believer of covid. So I doubt his senses were about how they were breaking the social distancing. 
These type of people think differently...
Literally...
[deleted]
God help those under your mercy..
Great idea!
I started hosting (free and safe) art and music events to help people find stuff to do post-covid
Ill make sure to add updates there so people can meet!
Well done/bien jou√©!
Well done. Being pro-active is the way to go. Good luck.
Hey, anyone fully vaccinated wanna come play [Micro Mages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFX401vvKTQ) with me on my NES and my giant 180-pound CRT?
tr√®s cool. good job :)
[meetup.com](https://meetup.com) is also a great place to find activities to do
This is great, merci!
Great idea, thx
Thanks for making this! Ended up going out and meeting some nice people from discord
Super id√©e! Je suis mod√©rateur pour deux subreddit Montr√©alais, je passe le mot!
It's been so hard meeting people here. Unfortunately I've been considering moving to a larger city lately, but if I end up staying this could be a major help. Thanks.
This is super dope! Great initiative. 
If anyome is into poker nights id be dowm to.throw one in a park or something!
Great initiative!
Great idea! however, the discord link doesn't seem to be working
Took you long enough
Yea!!! I'm always down for art activities Covid cut my lifestyle off at the knees. Queen bee of free art studios; swarms of munchkins making crafts on sundays...and then nothing. Just me and my tackle box of blue glue sticks and glitter. Making finger puppets for friends.
I wanted to do listening parties before it all started :(
Merci!
180 lb CRT? Damn, that's gotta be like a 5 inch screen!
[deleted]
Im hella down. I can bring my controller :)
Yes
Pour ajouter √† meetup, Eventbrite est tr√®s bien pour trouver des activit√©s et rencontres.
Don't wanna be a downer but it's not any better in Toronto or Vancouver lemme tell ya.
That'd be cool tbh!
Haha, it's actually one of the largest, last-gen flat-screen CRTs. I'm very proud of it! It's like, uhhhh... a metre by a metre and a half?
Link please!
I have four NES gamepads! But if you wanna use a dogbone or a NES advantage or something, sure, bring it!
Oui, √ßa aussi, mais pour les deux certain activit√©s ne sont parfois pas gratuit, alors r/MakeFriendsMTL c‚Äôest un bon alternative/addition
Toronto has so many more people in it though, I would think getting to meet people is more natural. And I don't speak French which makes me an outsider here :(
It's probably very valuable then, take care of it =D CRT's have a lot of performance characteristics that modern LCD's OLED's, etc can't match yet. Obviously you know this, but hopefully other people will note that this is actually cool and not insane.
[deleted]
Just DM me if you ever want to!
/r/askto is the local Reddit for frequently asked questions and you constantly have people complaining how everyone's so cold here, stuck with their high school groups, fake friendships that only stay at work. Made harder during covid.
It's not just the amount of people that makes it work, it's just going out and doing hobbies/sports/volunteer literally any interest and just evolving those relationships.
People think that moving in a bigger city instantly makes it easier when it's the same numbers game it is anywhere else. Just get involved as much as you can!
Best of luck!
> Toronto has so many more people in it though,
I thought that when I first moved there too. Remarkably unsociable. Not even eye contact. People you had a great convo with at a supper/BBQ will not even say hello if they see you the next day. This is a standard experience, not just me. It went on for *years*. Dreadful. Go anywhere else.
Do 'language exchanges' with Francos to meet people. Also, join Club Montreal Sport & Social at https://clubmontreal.ca/?no_lredirect=true - very fun.
Edit: You might also like Caf√© Pi   (as in 3.14...) There's chess and board games there. It's a mixed language kinda place. See: https://cafe-pi-self-service-restaurant.business.site
I once was trying to play Melee competitively, stopped playing for a long while (meanwhile CRTs died pretty definitively), and picked it/Project M up again for a short while a few years ago. Was pretty unreal to walk into an event with a room full of CRTs.
omg totes down for Arcade Mtl. I was actually thinking of bringing my stuff there!
They have an NES but sometimes they unplug it. We could talk to them ahead of time and then have a Micro Mages session there?
Will do! I'm liking more the Arcade Mtl idea right now, maybe we'll coordinate that instead.
More people means a wider variety of things to do and more people to do them. A large population here in MTL are just passing through for school and such too. The rest form their niches and start families if they stay. I'm beyond that age group now so it's not really accessible to do hobbies. I tried doing meetups for a few things and couldn't find more people in my age bracket, that's also English to boot.
But this discord looks considerably better than that attempts already. So I will try to check it out while I still can.

I mean that sounds like here. I have a feeling that is universal.
Chess/board game places dont work solo. People have established groups, so you're just there by yourself. Meetups is the only way to break into that, but age range on Meetup is whacky af here. Lots of older people.
Mon mari est Chinois et on connait des Chinois √† Vancouver, New York et San Francisco, c'est arriv√© dans toutes ces villes, et bien pires qu'au Qu√©bec (des personnes √¢g√©es attaqu√©es dans la rue par exemple). √áa m'inqui√®te pour mon fils, je sais que des jeunes font parfois des commentaires poches, le pire je pense c'est les petites insinuations qui finissent par le rendre honteux, il m'a m√™me dit qu'il aurait pr√©f√©r√© √™tre "juste Qu√©b√©cois". Il ne veut plus que je lui donne du riz dans son lunch, par exemple. Le racisme n'est pas mort loin de l√†.
Just naturally hateful and sad people who found a justification (in their minds) to hate others.
Je trouve √ßa vraiment bien qu‚Äôon parle finalement du racisme contre les asiatiques. Par contre, est-ce qu‚Äôon peut d√©noncer le racisme sans √©tiquetter les victimes comme des ‚Äúvrais Qu√©b√©cois?‚Äù Parce que si ce n‚Äô√©tait pas des ‚Äúvrais qu√©b√©cois‚Äù √ßa serait plus acceptable? 
Une attaque raciste est inacceptable, que la personne  soit ‚Äúqu√©b√©coise‚Äù ou non!
C‚Äôest tellement lourd √† porter de se faire traiter diff√©remment juste √† cause de son apparence. Surtout quand on aime Montr√©al autant que tout les autres.
I was in Montreal last year when the pandemic began. I‚Äôm an Asian woman and I remember coming back to my res from a date and my friends were immediately all over me asking if I was ok because the attacks on the two Koreans downtown had just happened. It was a strange feeling knowing that the world had gotten even more dangerous for me than before.
Je marchais l'autre jour et une madame qui marchait sur le m√™me c√¥t√© du trottoir que moi √† crach√© quand elle m'a vu en disant qqchose avec le COVID. J'√©tais la seule autre personne sur la rue.
J'ai senti instantan√©ment ce que je ressens a chaque fois que quelquechose comme √ßa m'arrive - √ßa commence avec la peur (qu'on m'attaque physiquement), ensuite la confusion, ensuite le d√©ni o√π je me dis que c'est pas si grave, ensuite √ßa me f√¢che, et a la fin, je me sens compl√®tement vid√©e, triste.
Mais des choses comme √ßa bas√© sur mon apparence, √ßa m'arrive une fois de temps en temps depuis que je suis jeune. C'est dure mais c'est rare et √ßa arrive. Cela ne me surprends pas.
Tout les gens sain et rationnel savent que le racisme est une cons√©quence d'une soci√©t√©s avec de la diversit√©, une manque d'empathie et de la g√©n√©ralisation facile. √áa empire lorsque la situation √©conomique est difficile dans un pays. C'est pas difficile a comprendre. 
Ce qui est difficile a comprendre c'est le manque d'empathie.
Je parle rarement de mes exp√©riences car quand j'en parle, m√™me mes amis proche commencent 9/10 avec "prends pas ca personnelle, oublie √ßa". Okay... Mais comment veut tu je ne prends pas ca personnelle. N'est ce pas naturel de ressentir ce que je ressens sans qu'on me demande de rusher et de move on?
C'est difficile de comprendre a quelle point le malaise d'aborder/accepter des sujets difficile m√®nent les gens a demander aux victimes de ces actes d'agir d'une fa√ßon... Pas humain. Laissez les gens se sentir f√¢ch√©, frustr√©, triste. Donnez leur du soutient et l'√©coute. Et s'ils vont trop loin, dites le mais quand √ßa vient d'arriver, donnez leurs la chance de s'exprimer l√† dessus.
Et c'est la m√™me chose pour quand d√©crit une exp√©rience personnelle difficile, que ce soit des aggressions ou harc√®lement verbale, physique, psychologique ou sexuelle.
√áa me rend tellement triste de voir que √ßa arrive ici aussi... horrible.
Racism? In Quebec?
Edit: Wow we are quick to deny facts lol. Pour ceux qui sont dans un triste √©tat de d√©ni, que diriez-vous de voir comment les crimes haineux au Qu√©bec (esp. Montreal ou on est plus divers) sont [*tellements* nombreux](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3510019101&cubeTimeFrame.startYear=2017&cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2019&referencePeriods=20170101%2C20190101) que ceux du reste du Canada et de ne pas attaquer quiconque les d√©nonce. Don't shoot the messenger, I didn't commit the hate crimes. 
Edit 2: changed one word, as we can agree that Quebec racism is *as bad as* the rest of Canada (waves a tiny flag unenthusiastically). My point was that Quebec has a racism problem, so it is not surprising to see this sad news.
I'm glad LaPresse made an article about it. Finally!
c'est qui ces racistes l√†??
Yont ben don pas d'instruisance pis de culturation
At the beginning of the pandemic I was already wearing a mask before it was really mandated, the nice Korean lady who runs my fave resto in Verdun was telling me to be careful, there'd been 3 attacks on Koreans. There's also been a rise in vandalism against asian commerces, especially in Chinatown. It's just really fucking awful.
Avec la CAQ qui fait la sourde oreille, les choses risque de s'empirer :(
Y a fallu j'intervienne dans le m√©tro cet √©t√©. Un musulman illumin√© d√©blat√®rait un discours raciste, des enseignements de son Imam √† ce qu'il disait et devenait de plus en plus agressif. Le pauvre couple de jeunes asiatiques assis tout pr√®s semblait vraiment d√©sempar√©. Je me suis dirig√© entre le couple assis et l'autre plouc et j'ai fait interposition regardant le dude dans les yeux et faisant non de la t√™te pendant 5 stations lol. √áa calm√© le jeu mais le fou √©tait encore bien remont√©....
During the first wave, I was downtown heading to work when a guy came up and pushed me down. He insulted me with racial slurs before walking away. This was during daytime. I didn't react violently but was just stunned it happened in MY Montreal. 
I was even more sad when I saw people looking at me like I was the one who committed a crime. No one helped me up nor asked if I was ok.
As an intersectional woman, I just felt powerless and sadly, all I got from friends was "There are dumb asses everywhere.". Another moment of racism against Asians brushed as nothing strange.
How can we protect them?
Peut-√™tre que si les m√©dias √©taient pas constamment en train de nous crinquer contre les Chinois √ßa serait moins pire. P√©ril jaune 2.0 gracieuset√© du journalisme jaune 2.0
Everyone's just looking for someone to blame. Interestingly, in China the situation seems to be flipped--Chinese people are blaming the spread of the virus on foreigners and are treating them poorly as a result. My (not Chinese) brother lives there and was recently asked to move out of his apartment due to his neighbours not wanting to live next to a foreigner who they assumed was a covid risk.
Last year there were even reports of black people being banned from hotels and businesses in China for the same reason.
Lots of cloudy judgment these days.
A couple weeks ago I asked my depp's clerk if she's from China with the intention of wishing her a happy chinese new year.
Man, the amount of defensiveness in her gaze when she answered. Don't know what they are going through but it must be tough.
Les porteurs de prejuges devraient etres integres dans un processus d'interaction communautaire dans le but d'humaniser la victime. Il faut eviter la radicalisation a tout prix.
y'a des choses dans la vie que je vais jamais comprendre, et le racisme en est une.  
:-(
Je suis quand m√™me surprise que ces actes racistes aient persist√© toute l'ann√©e. Au d√©but de la pand√©mie j'√©tais moins surprise, mais encore maintenant?
Fake news

Je trouve √ßa vraiment beau √† voir que vous √™tes autant compr√©hensive et sensible √† la r√©alit√© que vit votre fils. C‚Äôest tellement important d‚Äô√™tre fier de qui on est. Je peux un peu m‚Äôidentifier √† lui car j‚Äôai grandi dans un milieu Blanc dans Les Laurentides et jusqu‚Äô√† mes 18 ans j‚Äôavais honte d‚Äô√™tre Asiatique. Ce n‚Äôest plus du tout le cas maintenant pour moi! Mais le fait qu‚Äôil ait une maman comme vous qui porte attention √† ce genre de choses fera toute une diff√©rence dans son acceptation de lui-m√™me je crois :)
Maannnn. Je comprends. √áa fait 20 ans que j'ai √©t√© √† l'√©cole primaire et m√™me a l'√©poque on se moquait de moi pour mes lunchs. Quelle tristesse que 20 ans plus tard, certains parents n'ont pas assez √©voluer pour enseigner √† leurs enfants de ne pas agir comme des cons, et d'avoir un regard ouvert et curieux vers ce qu'ils consid√®rent comme diff√©rent. 
Perso j'ai manger ma bouffe culturelle et j'ai tougher, mais √ßa m'a grandement affecter. Courage a ton fils.
Dans l'ouest Am√©ricain c'est juste une continuit√© d'un ph√©nom√®ne connus, les personnes √¢g√©es asiatiques se font attaquer beaucoup plus parce qu'elle utilisent moins les banques alors ont souvent plus d'argent sur eux, ce qui en fait des proies all√©chantes pour les voleurs. Les √©v√®nements r√©cents sont juste une "justification" de plus pour les attaquer.
>Il ne veut plus que je lui donne du riz dans son lunch
Comme si le riz √©tait quelque chose de strictement chinois...ces jeunes l√† cherches vraiment pas loin.
C'est comme si on avait rien appris des camps d'internement japonais post 1941, ou des actes immondes commis contre les communaut√©es des Premi√®res Nations, ou de tout les mouvements de justice sociale des ann√©es 50-60-70. 
&#x200B;
Calisse, humanit√©.
√áa a peut-√™tre aussi √† voir avec le discours anti-Chine permanent que nous servent les grands m√©dias depuis un an, non ?
Excellent point. C‚Äôest fou que certaines victimes sont tellement sous le choc de ce qu‚Äôils ont v√©cu qu‚Äôils sous entendent que ce serait correct/moins pire s‚Äôils √©taient moins bon en fran√ßais ?!
I met online a Chinese girl as I was looking to improve my mandarin, and she wanted to improve her french. Of course, being super into the Chinese culture and her telling me the story of when she immigrated to Canada, I asked her after a while where she was from in China, and she was so shy to say she came from Wuhan. It broke my heart. People should always feel free to be proud of their culture.
Je suis choqu√©e que tes amis te r√©pondent comme √ßa. T‚Äôes pas en train de leur demander des conseils, t‚Äôes en train de partager une exp√©rience difficile que tu as v√©cue. C‚Äôest tr√®s ignorant.
You're better off without those 'friends' tbh. I would cut them off.
Je comprends pas pourquoi tu penserais que sa n'arrive pas ici?
Il faut arr√™ter de penser que l'endroit qu'on vie est la plus parfaite au monde...
Je regarde ton lien, et j'arrive pas a voir la statistique qui indique que les crimes haineux sont plus nombreux au Quebec ( je serais pas surpris si c'est le cas, mais le tableau ne semble pas indiquer ca ) . 
Disont que je prends 2 grandes ville en Ontario et 2 grandes villes au Quebec, par 100 000 habitant en 2019
Toronto : 7.2
Montreal : 5.4
Aussi Vancouver : 8.2
Calcary : 5.2
&#x200B;
Ottawa : 10.8 
Ville de Quebec : 8.6
&#x200B;
Moyenne dans les centre urbains ( selon le tableau ) : 6.0 par 100 000 habitants.
&#x200B;
Encore une fois, personne ne nie le racisme au Quebec.
Exactly as implied, you now explicity say Qu√©bec is more racist than the rest of Canada, which in itself is a very common and old francophobic trope. Weirdly enough, your own link doesn't show how much Montr√©al, which you say is especially typical of our hate crimes, is that much worse than the other metropolises : 
Montr√©al :  Number of hate crime incidents 311(2017) 258 (2018) 231 (2019) Rate per 100,000 population  7.4 (2017)  6.1 (2018)  5.4  (2019)
 Toronto : Number of hate crime incidents 519 (2017) 408 (2018) 419 (2019) Rate per 100,000 population 9.3  (2017) 7.2 (2018)  7.2 (2019)
 Vancouver :  Number of hate crime incidents 183(2017)  196 (2018) 220 (2019) Rate per 100,000 population  7.0(2017)   7.4(2018)  8.2 (2019)
I know it's hard to fight your own bias, but come on. 
Qu√©bec has a pretty big racism problem. But pegging Qu√©bec, and ''especially Montr√©al'' as the most racist of Canada is a problem in itself.
Yes. It exists, just like anywhere else.
The difference is that when the same thing happens in Ontario or BC nobody is going to make the same comment you just did. Which is ironic when commenting an article about racism.
Edit to respond to your edit:
You're full of crap and can't even read statistics properly. Rates are lower (or at worst comparable) for Montr√©al than for Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa.
> plus nombreux
According to this there less hate crimes in Montreal VS Toronto.
https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=3510019101
Why is are you so passionate about this mistaken belief that Quebec is more racist than the rest of Canada?
Its not only in Quebec it‚Äôs all over Canada and others countries too..
Come on this can‚Äôt be true
[deleted]
[deleted]
Les abonn√©s de la Gazette ont trouv√© Reddit, √† ce que je vois.
Quebec is generally less racist. That‚Äôs a fact. Nobody ever said it doesn‚Äôt exist, that‚Äôs ridiculous. 
https://twitter.com/voiceoffranky/status/1119080149159309312
Si tu veux jouer aux statistiques et pointer du doigt les gens: la majorit√© des asiatiques sont √† Montr√©al. La majorit√© des habitants de Montr√©al sont d'origine immigr√©e. On peut dire qu'une bonne partie des actes haineux contre les asiatiques viennent donc de personnes immigr√©es ou d‚Äôorigines immigr√©es.
comme si le racisme c'√©tait seulement au quebec qu'il y en a?
T‚Äôes stats te font honte
Your comment is like a flame to moths...racist moths.
Name a more open society, i‚Äôll wait.
I work there but to be honest, I prefer seeing it as a photo while working from home rather than seeing it day in and day out.
c'est /r/evilbuildings presque
Tiens, j'avais justement envie de me magasiner des downvotes aujourd'hui...
Je travail a cot√© mais jaime ce quils ont fat dans l'esplanade avec les bateaux, gazon artificiel et petites maisonettes... desfois ils y a de la musique live
je travailles sur ce coin de rue aussi - pas √©t√© au bureau depuis mars 2020 - au moins la pand√©mie aura donn√© ca de bon: le travail de la maison!!
Shiller again? damn this guy
Wait you‚Äôre telling me those buildings aren‚Äôt already protected/heritage worthy? I always assumed they were.
My mechanic is retiring and was a huge part of the community for 40 years.
The buyer is gonna scrap everything and build condos.
I get that we need places to live but holy shit I don't want our city to just be turned into a bunch of condos with nothing to see
Pourquoi je vois toujours Shiller dans ce genre de nouvelles; et c'est jamais des bonnes nouvelles. (asking for a friend).
I'm happy with the progress Mayor Plante has made on things like bike paths, and overall pedestrianization generally, but I feel like she's not done nearly enough to fight back on protecting the historical character of our neighborhoods. From commercial owners booting out long time tenants so they can raise rents to being on duty while investors are poised to reshape Chinatown... it's a huge failure.  I feel pretty apathetic about the next election to be honest.
Edit: corrected typo
Shitler Lavatories Inc strikes again, these fucking assholes
I am worried.
Furious but unsurprised. Chinatown has been stagnating for years, even decades I would say. 
I'll fight tooth and nail to save what little Chinatown has left though. It's good to see young people involving themselves and hope they garner enough support.
love it. let them continue to buy up everything and destroy neighborhoods - there will come a point where someone finally will look at them and will then be powerless to do anything because they'll own so much - and then they'll finally make Montreal like every other city
What Montr√©al needs is a vacancy tax and an oligopoly land holding law, plus someone at the revenu Qu√©bec to check that these mega-landlord owners are not laundering money because these purchases are so sketchy.
Here is the zoning information for the properties in question:
* [Fiche 0175](http://www1.ville.montreal.qc.ca/CartesInteractives/ville-marie/doc/VM_175.PDF)
* [Fiche 0284](http://www1.ville.montreal.qc.ca/CartesInteractives/ville-marie/doc/VM_284.PDF)
In both cases, the zoning permits construction up to 65 metres, which is equivalent to a 20-storey building. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that means Shiller could build a high-rise on the site without needing a zoning derogation. However, the properties are also part of a heritage zone because they are near to the Saint-Esprit church. That could give the city leverage to deny any demolition permits.
This is a strange photo to use
All the city needs to do is issue them zero work permits for anything other than preservation related works. If Schiller Lavy want to take on the role of custodians of heritage sites, let them!
I was just thinking that Montreal needs more ugly-ass, unaffordable condos instead of vibrant and diverse cultural spaces.
the of an era I guess :(
C‚Äôest terrible
OUI PAPA!

"Nobody eats Chinese food anymore!"
So what, all of Montreal downtown looks like shit eitherway, about time things get renovated/updated.
People talking about heritage but there's no preservation to begin with, it's like keeping an old moldy McDonalds without putting the effort to put it in a resin cube; like sure it's from the 19 hundreds but it also stinks up the whole place
The chinese mob needs their cut...what a joke.
That area is getting irrelevant and there is a new Chinatown popping somewhere because there is just no space and no development in the existing one.
Heritage preservation is a typical NIMBY excuse.
C'est le nouveau Sergakis!
I don't know if people realize there are 2 Shiller's. So the name comes up often because there are 2 people. There's Stephen Shiller of Shiller-Lavy and then there's Brandon Shiller and Jeremy Kornbluth (his business partner). Both involved in nasty real-estate investment schemes but one is mostly in Commercial real-estate and the other in residential.
The Shiller from Shiller-Lavy is the father of Brandon Shiller.
It's honestly astonishing how few of Montreal's buildings have heritage protection. Part of the problem is that heritage protection is a provincial jurisdiction and Montreal is specifically prohibited from giving any structures historic designation:
[CHARTER OF VILLE DE MONTR√âAL, METROPOLIS OF QU√âBEC](http://legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/fr/showdoc/cs/C-11.4?langCont=en)  
Section 34 
>The following powers may not be delegated:

Plus the condos are butt ugly. No sense of architectural style. Just boxes with shitty paneling
As a Torontonian I don't believe the people of MTL will let what happened in Toronto happen to your city. You guys are too passionate.
> I get that we need places to live but holy shit I don't want our city to just be turned into a bunch of condos with nothing to see
Pretty sure that's called Griffintown.
Most of the condos aren't even affordable by the average Canadian.
C'est pas populaire √©tre bottom feeder.
Better than Coderre, who now apparently wants more skyscrapers, taller than the mountain even!
She's fighting the easy battles and won't touch the hard ones with a ten foot pole. Her bubbly and smiling appearances in the media are honestly shameful at this point. She is unable to inspire any type of gravitas and gives the impression that she would easily get walked over by promoters and big moneys types.
There's not much left. Many of the buildings are in terrible shape, some abandoned, others have been 'renovated' very poorly with ugly siding and stucco. I don't like that it's SL,  but I think it's good that some capital may be invested to help rejuvenate the area. Such a prime location, such a shame that the city didn't do more with it.
Shiller represents greed and money interests.  The city needs to do a better job protecting properties they care about because people like Shiller, Sergakis and countless unamed parties will carve up the city.
You would be surprised at the percentage his father's company already owns.
It's members of the activist group trying to stop the disney-fication of our Chinatown. They are doing great work and deserve more press.
they about to drop the hawtest mix tape this summer
'hey you, act like youre proposing to this lady here'
Hi!   
If the work permit request follow existing zoning a city can not refuse to grant work permits.   
If a city does refuse a permit when the request is coherent with zoning, the person or company asking for the permit can easily sue and the court will issue (or force issue) the permit (with penalties).
I don't know what you're showing here...
am i misreading your comment? where‚Äôs the other Chinatown?
Pas mal plus gros que Sergakis je pense
Correction: The Shillers again? damn these guys (thanks for the clarification by the way)
On the flip side if you make them look better you up the already-way-too-expensive-for-a-regular-joe selling price
[deleted]
I heard they fucked up allowing too many condos to be built and don't even have a school within the district but that might just be a myth
Seriously. I'd like to buy a house one day and considered maybe a condo would be a reasonable first step.
NOPE
densification is bad ?
I'm no Coderre apologist but we should be aiming to densify downtown as much as possible no ?
Do you think the mayor personally approves every single property transaction in the city? 
Besides, read the article. Cathy Wong and Robert Beaudry are monitoring this case and it sounds like they will try to block any application for demolition or a zoning derogation.
Municipalities have limited powers under Quebec law. You can't blame Val√©rie Plante for everything happening in the city.
> but I think it's good that some capital may be invested to help rejuvenate the area.
You're dreaming. The Shillers are famous of buying up lands, evict tenants and let it sit vacant. They are speculating the price of the land and will only rent out to big retailers.
Both tenants and landlords should deal with the Tribunal administratif du Logement instead of each other. This way abuse on either side is hitting the body in charge of it instead of being swept away.
Landlords set rents, report it to the regie, the regie collects them, and then hands the payments to landlords. A portion of this can by insurance against deadbeat tenants so that landlords in good standing don't suffer. Property taxes can be collected at this point too. No need for private individuals to run credit checks.
If a tenant reports a slum, then the regie can withhold the rent payments and use that to resolve the issue of un-livability. 
If a landlord reports abuse to the regie and they don't do anything (property damage, non payment) then they can claim it against the insruance.
There would be a readily available history of landlord/tennants behaviours.
The renovictions here in Verdun are bad. Pretty sure our neighbours, who seemed like a quiet immigrant family, were here one week and gone the next. That same week, there was a crew who came in and demoed their unit, did some renovations and now they‚Äôre renting that one and the one below it for ~1500$.
It‚Äôs very much a lipstick on a pig situation. Building is in terrible shape, stairs are about to fall, ants that we can‚Äôt get rid of, no soundproofing whatsoever, pretty sure it‚Äôs shifting heavily one way since there‚Äôs a lot of new cracks and they don‚Äôt give a shit about their tenants.
Un registre des locatateurs et des logements locatifs enregistr√©s seraient l‚Äôid√©al. Un propri√©taire devraient devoir enregistrer son logement (sans frais) aupr√®s du gouvernement, le loyer √† chaque ann√©e, si il y d√©j√† eu des les plaintes aupr√®s du TAL... cette information devrait √™tre publique et facilement accessible.

Look, personne ne devrait s'enlever la vie quelque soit la raison (Lire l'article). Mais faire une manifestation croyant que la r√©novictions √©tait la cause est un peu pousser. Nos triplex et duplex date de 1950 et la plupart n'ont pas vraiment √©t√© r√©nov√© depuis les ann√©es 70. Si le monde sont dans ces b√¢timents l√† depuis 30-40 ans et que la personne n'a jamais chang√©, le prix que du logement par mois NE REPR√âSENTE PLUS la r√©alit√© que nous sommes dedans.   
C'est normal que le monde veulent r√©nover le tout pour augmenter le prix (qui refl√®te mieux la r√©alit√©). Oui les appartements sont cher si tu veux qqch dans Montr√©al proche d'un m√©tro. Si tu n'a pas l'argent, va plus loin non?
this is not the underlying problem, for if the rent was not unaffordable to the common worker, R√©no and Rona would be blistering with both tentants and landlords alike. When is the affordable housing project taking shape, Valerie?
Maybe the landlords can also have transparency with their tenants to show their cost of living as well. Perhaps the owner is senior and needs the rent to survive in the forever increasing price of *Senior Residence Homes*. How does taking all your income, pension, and other annuities sound as payment to exist?
This protest is pure trash, I'm sorry. again, this is not to be targeted at home owners. Many Many landlords went through epic hardships in their lifetimes to be where they are at.
Avoir un 3e partie qui garde l'argent des locataires 2 mois d'avance r√©glerait bien des probl√®mes, mais co√ªterait particuli√®rement cher en gestion et v√©rification de toutes les plaintes. On pourrait mettre le co√ªt sur la propri√©t√© lou√©e, mais le co√ªt serait directement transf√©r√© aux locataires et on se retrouve avec une autre augmentation √† chaque fois que les co√ªts de gestion du gouvernement augmentent. 
√áa c'est sans compt√© les probl√®mes et r√©ticences d'avoir un palier du gouvernement interf√©rer avec les investissements de particuliers.
Le march√© pr√©sent n'est pas id√©al, mais je crois qu'il vaut mieux am√©liorer ce que l'on a que de reconstruire de z√©ro. Par contre, il faudrait r√©ellement commencer par les app AirBnB qui r√©duisent le march√© de la location annuelle.
There needs to be some way to limit the cost of rent though. Too many landlords do renovictions, or jack the price by $300 at the end of a lease because the new tenant either doesn‚Äôt know they can go to the r√©gi, or they don‚Äôt want to start off on a bad note with the landlord who may then ¬´¬†take their time¬†¬ª to fix things or do their duty.
> Tribunal administratif du Logement
Can you imagine their backlog right now?
Do you think landlords will actually trust le Tal for one second? The same guys that tell you they aren't ready to hear your case after waiting for 4 months, the guys that only allow you to raise rent 10$ a month after you renovate a complete kitchen and expect you to pay it off in 43 years when it will only last 15 years. I can go on and on but fuck me is the Tal the last person I trust in these matters.
This seems like a great idea... who‚Äôs gonna pay for it? More taxes? Take the money from the rent the landlords are supposed to receive? Get rent from the tenants and add a little extra for this board? Without money, ideas are just that, ideas.
If that would be the case, rents would be double what they are now... and most properties would be owned by big corporations.
The way it works, is that you get a deadbeat tenant that doesn't pay rent for 6 months, you finally kick them out, and then they have to pay you back the rent during the next few years. 
When I did it with a tenant, the tenant was supposed to pay 11$/month and the Regie fees were 15$/month... so 4 work days wasted + 200$ a few times to get back 11$ minus 15$ fees for the next 29 years...  or drop the case.
This is the most sensible thing I've ever read regarding housing issues. Better yet, the Regie can intervene directly if the landlord is trying to pull a fast one on renting price.
That being said, if I'm not mistaken a landlord has no right to require a credit check; it's just that if you decline, they'll automatically bin your application.

/r/thanksimcured/
Le probl√®me c'est que d'un bord, tu as des gens qui ont de la difficult√© √† se trouver un logement, de l'autre tu as des propri√©taires qui veulent plus de cash.
C'est vraiment √ßa le d√©balancement, l'inflation des prix aide seulement les riches.
Quand tu vois les "landlord professionels" qui mettent les gens √† la rue pour des piaces, c'est vraiment difficile d'√™tre en leur faveur. Que √ßa soit l√©gal ou non, ce sont des m√©chant trou d'cul et ils devraient le sentir √† tous les jours.
J'ai pas la solution, je pense que c'est pour des probl√®mes complexes comme √ßa qu'on a besoin d'experts mais je ne peux pas croire que "c'est de m√™me maintenant" c'est le mieux qu'on peut faire.
> Oui les appartements sont cher si tu veux qqch dans Montr√©al proche d'un m√©tro. Si tu n'a pas l'argent, va plus loin non?
Argument un peu nul, sans le m√©tro, t'es oblig√© d'avoir une voiture dans MTL. Les bus sont tr√®s mauvais globalement, peut √™tre un point que la ville devrait travailler.  
> Nos triplex et duplex date de 1950 et la plupart n'ont pas vraiment √©t√© r√©nov√© depuis les ann√©es 70. 
En revanche ici, je suis parfaitement d'accord. Et ces ann√©es sont cruciale dans la r√©novation car c'est √† cet √©poque o√π l'amiante √©tait roi. Aujourd'hui si tu dois faire une r√©novation, deux choix, soit tu la couvre soit tu l'enl√®ves. 
Le premier cas est possible selon l'√©tat de l'amiante (friable ou pas, endommag√©e ou pas, etc...). Si tu tombes dans le deuxi√®me cas, √ßa co√ªte une fortune (pression n√©gative, employ√© qualifi√© n√©cessaire, nettoyage intense apr√®s travaux, etc...).
Je suis rendu √† Chambly, proche de rien, dans un 4 et demi parce que √ßa me prenais un bureau. Mon rent est de 780, le lavabo d√©gueule son eau par le trou du lave vaisselle, la porte patio barre pas, les light fixtures sont bris√©es, dans un bloc de 24 unit√©s. Le concierge ici lui-m√™me dit que les proprios se calissent du bloc.
Ce n'est plus une question de placement. C'est une question de soci√©t√©. Ce n'est pas normal que je doive me trouver une blonde ou un coloc pour vivre dans un endroit d√©cent. Ce n'est pas normal que 34% de mon salaire mensuel soit du loyer quand les recommendations sont de pas payer plus cher que 25% de ton salaire.
You know who benefits from proximity to metros and living in walkable neighbourhoods? People who don't drive Ford Escalades in the fucking city. Yuppies go back to your trashy Griffintown condos.
Also, our communities are not your get-rich-quick schemes.
It's very obvious that there is work at hand, trying to displace vulnerable people from the resources they require for the purpose of disnefying our neighbourhoods for the entertainment of the upper classes. It's time to send these trash bags back to the wasteland they created.
Ten years ago, these NPCs wouldn't have taken a shit in a bush, in Villeray but now that Ricardo says that ItS A ViBRaNt cUlTuRaL gUnUiNe uRBaN eXpErIeNcE, they don't like their worthless, vapid Griffintown condos anymore.
En fait c‚Äôest aussi que quand t‚Äôa un building de 1950-70 pis que tu l‚Äôas jamais r√©nov√© √† fond, y‚Äôa plus rien proche d‚Äô√™tre aux normes et t‚Äôa plein d‚Äôamiante. √áa co√ªte cher √† r√©nover pour vrai.

Tout √† fait, c'√©tait seulement le catalyste.
Exactly
Peut-√™tre il y a 10-15 ans, mais l√† c'est une toute nouvelle classe d'investisseurs immobilier qui veulent juste profiter de la hausse des logement et tout faire pour que √ßa empire. La quantit√© de r√©noviction a juste explos√© et non c'est pas des petits propri√©taires qui ont achet√© des blocs pour leur vieux jours et habitent au rez de chauss√© qui sont derri√®re. J'ai une amie qui a re√ßu une lettre qui disait 'nouveau propri√©taire gtfo, on r√©nove et la grand-m√®re emm√©nage', seulement ils ont envoy√© exactement la m√™me lettre avec la m√™me grand-m√®re √† des dizaines et des dizaines de locataires dans tout leur parc immobilier. Et des histoires shady de m√™me, il y en a √† la pellet√©. Le fils de mes propri√©taires actuel nous a pas mal dit, d√®s que mes parents meurent, on vous fait le coup. C'est du pur parasitisme.
While I agree with the part oboist retirement homes taking thousands a month, that has to be such a small percentage of landlords in that position. 
They should sell their property off they need the lonely, not try to create an income. Being a landlord shouldn‚Äôt be a job. It honestly is reficulous how people buy property just so they won‚Äôt have a job, and live off the passive income and do little to no work. Plus, because these people don‚Äôt sell their property there is a housing shortage and it makes home prices skyrocket due to lack of availability.

And if the landlord had to justify things to the regie instead of a uniformed immigrant, then they wouldn't be able to exploit.
I can give you my perspective as a developer who builds **mid-rise new constructions** specifically for Montreal.
Renoviction will probably keep rising simply because it's the only avenue to get market rents. I mean, just look at it from their perspective, if you spend $1000 to fix a bathroom that your tenant damaged, under current TAL rules, you make that back in 43 years? So are we really surprised by renoviction when leases are auto-renewed?
Not to mention, my most recent project of a building extension (adding 30 large 3-bedroom units) has tenants paying $350-700 in rent for a 1400 sqrt foot 3 bedroom apartment in CDN (the current landlord of this particular building bought it this year and has been able to raise it by 5-10$) lol.
The problem with rapidly rising rents for when they become available --> is there isn't enough supplies due to rent control, & regulations at the provincial and municipal level.
For example, outside downtown montreal, over half of new construction occurs in CDN-NDG because that borough has regulations in place for owners to extend their buildings and build brand new apartments. But when you look at the borough right next door (ville saint-Laurent), it took me over 2 years to get permits (compared to 3 weeks in CDN). In fact, most boroughs in Montreal has rules that makes it extremely hard to build (Pointe-Claire, Verdun, & Rosemont being some of the hardest). You have a situation where developers like me has 90% of their projects either in downtown or CDN-NDG (meaning 2 boroughs are carrying the entire weight).
With the lack of appartements/houses. The landlord doesn't even need to raise the price by himself. So many people will want it, that it will start a bidding war.
so fund them better.
I DGAF if they trust the TAL or not. Plenty of folks don't trust the SAAQ, but that system works fine.
Maybe, just maybe you wouldn't have to renovate the whole fucking kitchen if landlord actually took care of their properties.
Just like you don't need to change your car every other year because you take it to the garage for minor repairs.
Fuck, how is this so hard to fathom?
That's not how it works in reality mate. Getting the rent from the "deadbeat" tenant that finally leaves? Be my guest to chase after them or have a third party go after them. 90% of landlords can't be bothered because less be honest, they're just relieved that they're done with it.
Le march√© est surtout d√©balanc√© en termes de valeur immobili√®re et loyer.
√Ä moins que t'aies la propri√©t√© d√©j√† pay√©e, ou h√©rit√©e et m√™me √† √ßa tu te mange le gain en capital, c'est pratiquement impossible de mettre un loyer qui ne va pas te laisser cashflow negative dans le meilleur des cas si tes locataires paient √† chaque mois.
Oui, tu vas te faire de l'argent en revendant, surtout que √ßa explose, mais justement √ßa fait juste favoriser le moussage des prix pour s'√©changer les propri√©t√©s.
Si les valeurs immobili√®res √©taient et montaient raisonnablement et que de l'autre bord ce serait possible de mettre un loyer qui va combler l'entretient, l'hypoth√®que et une cut pour le proprio t'aurais une vision g√©n√©rale du march√© beaucoup plus long terme avec des immeubles qui ne changent pas de mains chaque d√©cennie. Que les hypoth√®ques se rallongent n'aide pas du tout non plus. Trainer √ßa 30 ans c'est dur.
C'est s√ªr que baser l'investissement immobilier sur la valeur de l'immeuble pendant que la gestion de locataire ne t'am√®ne m√™me pas √† break even, et donc o√π t'es encourag√© √† monter les loyers autant que possible pour r√©duire ton d√©ficit mensuel √ßa m√®ne juste √† de la marde pour tout le monde.
C'est pas pour rien que le monde finisse par juste tout vendre en condo.
Amiante, pyrite, tuyaux en plomb, les edifices des ann√©es 60-70 ne sont simplement pas tr√®s bons.
Les appartments sont dans un √©tat mis√©rable parce que les r√®gles rendent impossible de les maintenir. Et ici on a une manifestation qui voudrait que ces r√®gles soient encore pire. Oui tu as raison ca n'a pas d'allure, mais ce n'est pas la faute des proprios, ni la faute des locataires, c'est la combinaison d'une augmentation de la population avec des lois et r√©glements anti-d√©velopement.
Being a landlord shouldnt be a job... HA!. i see you've never dealt with tennants...  tennants can be really a handfull... renos are a handfull, emergencies are also a handfull, banks are hell ... tennants don't alwase see  all that is involved in managing a multiplexe...
I agree to sell off, however many of our aged home owners might also not be in a sound mind to sign off on any legal matters. when it comes to estates, their children are not permitted to sign a sale for them. these aged folks are in near similar ratio in and around Montreal, that are people afflicted with renoviction. I could be wrong, but we still have a healthy amount of living European migrants of near yester century that aren't currently participating in stimulating the monetary market.
It would help but not sure that would stop all the exploitation. Also non-immigrants are also abused. The average person I know has a slumlord as a landlord. I‚Äôve had maybe 2 good/decent landlords in all of Montr√©al almost 6 years.
Yeah, sounds like beaurocratic BS. I think a major issue is lack of government support of subsidy to build for a rapidly growing population. There are already people living 2 or 3 person in an apartment meant for 1
That‚Äôs another problem altogether. But the landlord shouldn‚Äôt be able to just jack the price due to demand. I live in Toronto for 6 years before loving to Montr√©al and people (myself included) were paying 75% of their monthly income just to pay rent. Just because the demand is there doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs ethical, because these people have no choice but to enter poverty to cover rent prices. Because either they ou the price or have nowhere to live. Yes, are people ‚Äúwilling‚Äù to pay it? In a sense. They HAVE to.
I would abolish them if I had the money
The SAAQ doesn't really have disputes to settle, though.
You are ignorant.
That's what I'm saying, I wasted time and money for something that was not enforced at all... So basically waste of time.
T'es tu en train d'insinuer que les proprios devraient payer leur hypoth√®que avec les loyers? Messemble que c'est avec leur job qu'ils devraient payer l'hypoth√®que, les loyer c'est pour l'entretien et leur temps.
Je comprends que les propri√©taires s'essaient, mais j'ai l'impression que tu d√©finis "cashflow n√©gatif" comme "pas capable de faire payer ma batisse par mes locataires", et que √ßa justifie leur comportement; j'esp√®re que je me trompe.
Si l'immeuble est en tellement mauvais √©tat que les r√©nos sont pas couvertes par les loyers, ben j'esp√®re que la b√¢tisse a pas co√ªt√© cher, parce que les r√©nos elles font partie de ton investissement astheur. Pas question de mettre l'investissement du proprio sur le dos des locataires voyons donc
Viens me dire qu'il y a un r√®glement qui rend impossible pour mon propri√©taire de poser un bouchon sur ma plomberie ou faire changer ma porte patio.
Edit to add: Actuellement, plut√¥t que d'entretenir leur propri√©t√©, ils se font b√¢tir un bloc de condo. Just sayin'
The average landlord who owns a 2 or 3 storey does nothing. I‚Äôve have at least 10 apartments in 12ish years and they‚Äôre all pretty bad and VERY rarely are things done for tenants. They‚Äôre run as businesses to maximize profit and lower cost. 
I know how much goes into owning a property, I‚Äôm a homeowner.
I‚Äôd think if they aren‚Äôt in a frame of mind to sell their home they‚Äôre not in a frame of mind to be a landlord either.
single payer works for healthcare to stop exploitation, I see no reason it wont work for housing.
And you're right. Uniformed immigrant, uninformed student, uniformed single parent, it's all interchangeable.
If a slumlord wants to try to exploit, let them try to exploit the ONLY client they can ever have and see how well it works out for them

Fun fact: these rules make the streets safer for other non-car road users too. Pedestrians, people on mobility scooters, kids whose ball rolled on the street, dogs, etc.
6.5 when turning right, bikers in a bike lane going straight have right of way so look both ways and pause before turning. 
Overall the bike lanes make things safer for bikers, but there is that one situation that makes me so nervous. I've seen a biker get hit by a car who thought all was clear because they were turning right. The biker was ok but still traumatic

Je vie sur une rue sense unique et je suis d√©j√† pass√© proche de me faire rentrer dedans par un v√©lo qui roulait au sense inverse.
Je pr√©cise aussi qu'une voiture qui sort d'une place de stationnement situ√©e sur un terrain aura pas non plus n√©cessairement le reflex de regarder dans le sense inverse du traffic *pour les v√©los*. Il risque de regarder pour voir si un pi√©ton arrive mais vu qu'il y a des voitures stationn√©es entre le trottoir et l√† o√π les v√©los roulent, il regardera probablement pas si un v√©lo roule dans le sense inverse.

Il serait beaucoup plus efficace d'int√©grer les multiples usagers de la route dans les r√®gles de construction de celles-ci pour am√©liorer la s√©curit√© de tous. Les infrastructures routi√®res, pi√©tonnes, cyclables et de transport en commun doivent √™tre int√©gr√©es pour bien cohabiter. Amsterdam a fait √ßa brillamment. [Voici un vid√©o sur le sujet qui est tr√®s int√©ressant !](https://youtu.be/c1l75QqRR48) D√©montrez votre volont√© √† vos √©lus !

D'apr√®s-vous qu'est-ce qui fait que les gens sont aussi anti cyclistes √† Montr√©al ? Est-ce que c'est juste un r√©flexe nord-am√©ricain ?
I do love how 60-70% of the comments are just "wHat AbOuT cyClisTs"?!
Guys, it's ok to take a second and say "yeah, drivers do a lot of shitty things that put people's lives in danger. We should work on that.". 
It's also possible this kind of attitude is what leads to a lot of these accidents. If you're more worried about being angry at cyclists than respecting them as road users, you're a huge part of the problem. Be better citizens.
1- respect cars can run you over
2- don‚Äôt try to squeeze between cars to get in front of us all.
3- look around you when people are crossing the street so you don‚Äôt clip them.
4- signal all direction changes
5- don‚Äôt cut off cars at your slower pace while listening to AirPods
6- don‚Äôt burn red lights because you don‚Äôt feel like stopping.
C le fun ce jeu.
J'aime √ßa ce genre de post, plein de gens sont absolument incapables de se retenir de dire : "Oui mais les cyclistes aussi doivent suivre des r√®gles!" plus que deux secondes.
"What's indicating?" - 50% of Montreal drivers probably
C'est pas genre‚Ä¶ d√©j√† du mat√©riel de cours de conduite?
No driver wants to hit a cyclist, I follow all of these rules but of course, cyclists also need to do their part. If they are on the road I expect them, to bike in the correct direction, not scoot along the right hand side of cars putting themselves in cars blind spots, to signal like cars have to, to respect signalling and to stop at stop signs the same way cars have to.
Cyclist here; none of this is necessary. Please just be mindful of  cyclists. And cyclists, stop being so angry at everything. We share the road with vehicles 20 to +1000x our weight, accept it and be careful. Regardless of the rules, when you collide with a vehicle, you will lose every time. If you dont get hurt, be happy, not destructive at the person who may have been at fault. Love you all.
Please be careful on the streets for those bikers. Fun fact; stats show most accidents involving bicycles are caused by the riders. So be extra careful on a bike!  No matter who‚Äôs fault it is, it will always end up with the big heavy car winning that battle.
r/coolguides
So like be aware of your surroundings and be courteous? Good luck!
Je vais commencer √† faire du v√©lo prochainement comme m√©thode de transport. Il y a-t-il une ressource qui dicte les r√®gles √† suivre sur la route? *Hopefully* pas un document .pdf de 100 pages :P
√Ä ce que j'ai compris, tu as les m√™mes r√®gles qu'une voiture, sauf que tu dois prendre la piste cyclable s'il y en a une.
I avoid squeezing next to a bus or a big car while stopping at a red light, don't want to take a chance that they don't see me and are turning right. Unless there is that green bike area in front and enough space on the bike lane.
Anyone else hate biking on Saint-Urbain between Place-des-Arts and Place D'Armes? The bike lane ends in the middle of the street and leaves little space for bikes while many cars are turning right on Ren√©e-L√©vesque
Moi je suis juste tann√© de me faire crier des b√™tise, genre d'aller sur le trottoirs, pcq je suis sur la route et je roule plus lent, je suis toujours √† droite SAUF si je veux tourn√© √† gauche ou pour √©vit√© des obstacle (voiture arr√™te etc.).
Long live the pogo stick .
Glad to see this messaging on the other foot :) I was taught these things in driving school, things can change little by little!
point 3!! happened to me twice on the same day..
To a certain extent when you hop on the bike in the city you gotta expect everything. Rode for your safety not for the traffic laws.
Oui oui et oui √©viter de klaxonner, √ßa nous fait peur et g√©n√©ralement c des gens qui sont juste impatient
En gros, tu dois conduire selon le code de conduite normal.
√âtant un gars qui vit dans la partie banlieusarde de Montr√©al, je suis totalement en accord, les conducteurs sont moron et pas habitu√©s mais les cyclistes aussi.
J'ai la mauvaise habitude de penser que les cycliste vont s'arr√®ter au stop ou aux lumi√®res, comme une voiture...quand c'Est clairement pas le cas en ville
Il va falloir faire une affiche pour les cyclistes,
It would be nice if they actually used the bike paths to begin with.....
The other side of this diagram is that there are so many ways a driver can kill a cyclist inadvertently.  I don't miss driving downtown...and I'm sure downtown doesn't miss me and my car.
stay tuned for your eleven o'clock news, here's what's trending:
17 cyclists were struck down within 48 hours by distracted drivers while reading about 6 golden rules on their devices while operating a vehicle..
If only everyone respect the rules of the road this wouldn‚Äôt be an issue. Some of these rules are in place because either party is guilty of frequently breaking them.
Tellement de grands esprits ici, incroyable.
Comme si tous les automobilistes √©taient des sans dessins.
Pas mal de cyclistes ne respectent pas du tout le code et conduisent en innocent aussi.
Soyez respectueux des autres aussi.
Cyclists should also know they're not cars though. 
Both have a responsibility to each other. 
Problem is , even if the cyclist is the one who makes the mistake..the river gets the blame because he rarely gets hurt.
Where's the infographic for bikers to stay safe around fast-moving (harder to control) hunks of metal?
If it was in English, fewer cyclists would die.
Nah
Cyclists should also learn not to bike around like if they own the road and cross streets without even looking.
They should do rules for the bicycles too.  I mean, a bike can‚Äôt be riding in the middle of the road with his kid behind too right.
Edit: I may be downvoted by saying that bicycles need rules too.  Though, aren‚Äôt we looking for the safety of bicycles here??
Or, are we looking to give to the cyclists to drive wherever they want. Even in the middle of the road, between cars, passing red lights or going in packs of bicycles on intersections..
100% d'accord.
Maintenant, pour les cyclistes:  
1-ne roulez pas dans la rue quand y a une piste cyclable juste l'autre bord de la rue, ne traversez pas les intersections en diagonale, ne vous plantez pas entre deux chars √† une intersection  
2-ne vous arr√™tez pas dans la rue pour gosser dans votre cellulaire  
3-regardez ailleurs que juste devant vous quand vous d√©cidez de tourner  
4-signelez tout changement de direction  
5-√©vitez de sacrer apr√®s un automobiliste qui vient juste de vous voir parce qu'y doit regarder lui aussi partout (y a pas juste to√© sur la route, mon ami cycliste!)  
6-n'oubliez pas que le Code de la route est √©galement pour les v√©los
Bonne journ√©e, l√†!
lol r/bicyclette, commencer par faire vos stop pi par vous arr√™t√© aux feux rouge.
on est chanceux √† Montr√©al, les automobilistes ne klaxonnent pas souvent.
How else do I get the driver in front of me to enter the intersection 0.2 seconds after the green light instead of 0.8 seconds?
Some background on this:
The inspector walked into the store after closing hours, asked what was the least expensive item they had to sell, purchased it, and then stated that the store had broken the law, issuing them a fine.
Which seems like some kind of entrapment if you ask me.
The other thing is this: this law only applies to small businesses. You can go buy toys at the pharmacy, which is allowed to be open late. Or at the department store. Or Walmart. All of the big businesses are given exceptions to these rules.
Remember this the next time the Quebec gov't tells you they're pro-business.
They'll happily give your money to the Bronfmans to build a baseball stadium, but they'll also take your money if you dare to be open five minutes after the provincially-mandated closing time.
Hi there. My name is Jordan and I work at a record store in the Mile-End. I've been speaking to one of the owners of Jouet LOL Toys the past couple days and we discovered that  this is the same inspector who gave fines to a bunch of shops in the Mile-End a couple years ago. Even though the inspector told each store (mine included) that he was giving us a warning and we wouldn't be fined if we changed our hours, we still received fines of close to $3000. [https://cultmtl.com/2021/07/2900-fine-against-montreal-record-store-dropped-less-than-24-hours-before-court-date-phonopolis/](https://cultmtl.com/2021/07/2900-fine-against-montreal-record-store-dropped-less-than-24-hours-before-court-date-phonopolis/)
It's pretty telling that, in an era of Amazon's stranglehold and increased corporate franchising, the province is choosing to target small business - many of who struggle to pay rent and basic needs of operation.  Look at all the vacant storefronts around the city and wonder why our government is sending out inspectors to dole out these types of fines.
Someone worth questioning regarding all of this is Pierre Fitzgibbon, Quebec's Economy Minister. The fines stem from his department. This is a guy who had to temporarily leave his post earlier this year for ethical conflicts because he owned shares in two huge investment companies (White Star Capital and ImmerVision). He's back in power again, so that whole conflict-of-interest saga is worth brushing up on if you want to get a sense of what kind of wealthy and entitled people are behind the inspections and fines.
I wouldn't be surprised if these are calculated shakedowns - couched in a shroud of so-called legal definitions - that officials in positions of power use to allocate money for their own personal interests; especially in the event where a longstanding business has to declare bankruptcy, allowing real estate and large chains an opportunity to swoop in and buy the building.
Jouet Lol Toys are probably far from the only small businesses being targeted in this manner, so I hope others may come forward if this situation happened to them, too.
Why the fuck is there a 5pm time limit for small stores on the weekend? Who voted for that???
Why are we paying for inspectors to monitor stores opening hours?
Je supporte le magasin. S'en est ridicule √† quel point tout ferme trop t√¥t, alors qu'on doit faire de longues heures de travail. Je me demande qui va magasiner dans les heures de bureau?
I don't understand why small businesses have to close at 5. That seems counterintuitive to competitiveness if all major retailers can stay open till 9. Maybe that's why I still haven't been able to visit the bookshop that's on the way home. Could still hightail it down to indigo downtown, but the local shop must close at 5 because \[redacted\].
Why the fuck do we even have laws telling stores when they can be open and closed? Stores should be allowed to be open whenever they like. The absurdity of this is frightening and only serves to lower people's opinions of this city/province.
Sad! üò¢ How to put people out of business during a pandemic ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è So glad they‚Äôre fighting this, I hope they set a precedent for other small businesses. Wishing the store the best ‚ù§Ô∏è This is so frustrating for small businesses!
So fucked up. I know the family and they're so sweet. They really don't deserve this
Je savais m√™me pas qu‚Äôil avait une heure de fermeture l√©gale, WTF? En quelle ann√©e on vie?
I understand that there were good reasons for the working hours laws to be enacted and I support those reasons.
However, things changed in 30 years and we live in a completely different commercial context. 5PM is just too early and there has to be some exceptions for businesses exclusively operated by their owners.
I sometimes wonder if I actually disagree with the laws in Quebec or if I just hate how they are enforced. The inspector in this article, for example, was being a fucking cunt.
The dogmatic adherence to bureaucratic regulations in French society is an absolute plague upon this province. And, if you ask me, it has a lot to do with latent Catholic culture. The same reason why it is necessary for stores to close early on the weekends.
How about sex toys stores closing late? üòÖ
wont someone think of the children????!?!
The new normal: businesses, churches and schools punished for catering to the public.
Si je suis propri√©taire d'un commerce et que j'ai envie de rester ouvert toute la maudite journ√©e et d'y travailler personnellement 7 jour sur 7, ca change quoi, vraiment ? Au pire je comprends qu'on ne veut pas encourager la comp√©tition d√©loyale et commencer une guerre d'heure de service...Mais le commerce en question est ouvert au publique de mercredi √† samedi jusqu'√† la anarchique heure de 18h maximum..Y√© ou le probl√®me!? Je peux pas m'emp√™cher d'√™tre cynique face √† tout √ßa.
Might be time to just elect governments that will act like the rest of Canada and not control every aspect of your lives. Between thos, language laws and other restrictions I am surprised small businesses still exist. There really should not be so much red tape...
Article says his court date was yesterday. Anyone know how to find the results? I'm curious what happened to him.
I mean if we're going to impose a 5pm limit then we might as well force Amazon and all of e-retail to follow the same schedule (can you imagine the chaos?!)
Well what about Amazon or shopping online? Like fuck this shit! yet another law trying fuck the livelihood of hardworking people and push in the wealth transfer. Makes me sick
OK, how can we realistically do something about this overzealous inspector?
Explains why I've started seeing stores for Smokers selling food. Gotta pretend to be a d√©panneur.
Ok, faque mettons que j‚Äôarrive 5 min apr√®s la fermeture d‚Äôun magasin pour une raison X. Que l‚Äôemploy√© est encore en dedans derri√®re sa caisse en train de faire son closure...Pis qu‚Äôil se dit dans sa t√™te: bah, je vais rendre service au dude dans la fen√™tre et le laisser entrer pareil. Vite, prends l‚Äôaffaire que t‚Äôas de besoin, paye ciao bye. 
√Ä la place du client je serais extr√™mement contente d‚Äôavoir eu mon cossin au lieu d‚Äôavoir √† me d√©placer √† nouveau. Pis l‚Äôemploy√© rend service au magasin en augmentant leur revenu tout en aidant un autre humain. Tout le monde est gagnant l√† dedans...wtf
I propose that only equal partners or sole owners are allowed to work past the regulated hours. That will allow small business like Jouets LOL Toys to run at later hours while ensuring that retail labour isn\`t forced to work at unsual hours.
Damn, if only there was an upcoming election that could address this kind of issue...
r/pasloignon
Why can't people close their store whenever they want?
Rizzuto for sure
I don't get it. Why Renaud-Bray/Walmart/Archambault can be open until 21h but small businesses have to close that early? After that they tell us we have to buy local to help the economy because of the pandemic. I totally agree with buying local, it's just that their Panier Bleu is really hypocrital. 
Maybe is a double-ticket: You don't have to fairly pay taxes AND you can close late! 
But I'm wondering if Dollorama closes that early because it started here (even if it's a pretty big store now). Renaud-Bray is also a business from Montreal...
DCF - Des edgelord quasi-libertarien qui chialent que le gouvernement encadre le travail et les heures d'ouvertures.
La loi devrait √™tre chang√©e, les propri√©taires devraient √™tre exempt√©s s'ils veulent travailler plus longtemps eux m√™mes, les grandes cha√Ænes doivent √™tre des cibles de cette loi comme les petits commerces et le dimanche devrait √™tre ferm√© pour les commerces.
Why would you want to be open when other people are not working?
I grew up in Montreal and have lived in France for the last 10 years.  I really like that everything is closed on Sunday.  Makes things much more calm everywhere.   However there is always a pharmacy open somewhere nearby or the odd cafe open.   Then again it‚Äôs nice that rona is open at 830 pm on a Sunday when your sink drain falls apart
The nine most terrifying words in the English launguage are, "I"m from the Government and I'm here to help."
important context, thank you
The worst part is that it's not the first time they pull that off. Every time it makes it to the news. And they keep doing it. How can these inspectors still have a job?
Tu as raison, les grands magasins aussi devraient √™tre assujettis √† ces lois.
Je suis d'accord, les lois surnles heures d'ouverture sont absolument inutiles.
I mean, the Canadians were allowed to play hockey for big money but kids couldn't play outdoors on a public rink. Big business always wins in the end.
So gross
Damn, if only there was an upcoming election that could address this kind of issue...
They are pro-big business, not small business. And cops go on power trip, they do not even realize the reason why they patrol is to keep the public safe from COVID. For them, its just a game and another place where they can flex their power. Ugh
The department stores and Walmart (even the ones with groceries) also close at 5PM on weekends.
This is a eye opening message. Thank you. Damn bro... Being so difficult for small businesses to compete, and they even get knee capped by their own government...
Walmart is not open past 5 on Saturdays and Sundays, no department store are.
It sounds like these businesses should egregiously abuse the online purchase loophole‚Ä¶ have the customer place the order on the internet in the store, then use the same day pick up service, and walk out‚Ä¶
pharmaceutical, hygienic or sanitary products, newspapers, periodicals, books, tobacco or articles required for the use of tobacco" ([L√©gis Qu√©bec](http://legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/ShowDoc/cs/H-2.1#se:7)) you're allowed to be open later. Groceries, restaurants, cultural establishments, etc are also exempt from this restriction. Walmart, as an example, has grocery items PLUS all the aforementioned, hence why they are allowed to remain open while a clothing store is not. Maybe Simon's ought to start selling tampons lol?
Also, the intent of the law was to give the primarily minimum-wage workers who are in retail time off on the "standard weekend" so that they can hang out with everyone else.
I for one am willing to suffer the minor inconvenience of not being able to buy clothes, toys, games, furniture, etc. after 5pm on weekends so that those people can have a life.
Obviously they need the small buisness cash cow that don't have top tier lawyers on retainer... Plus all the small guys pay for everything while the big corporations pay absolutely no tax income and treat employees like shit
You know what's funny. Most around here support the fine without realising that the most hours put in at a small business is done by the owner not employees. If it was up to most people on r/Montreal all business would be owned by the state
historical laws. they had some sense, but with online stuff now, they are useless.
I thought it was some sort of cultural thing as to why everything closes so early.  
My wife and I are used to hang out and buy stuff kind of late, so the first time that we went out around 9pm (a bit early where we are from) we were shocked when we found everything already closed.  
But we just told ourselves this should be what everyone is used to, not that it was a law.
I really like it! I like how the sculptures seem real and partaking on the fun. However .... after a close inspection, I think that guy shouldn't be touching the bike that way.
Vraiment vraiment cool!
I missed tamtams..
This is still goin on?It‚Äôs awesome been hearing about it for years!
You have an amazing style.  Very expressive. Great work.

Comme j'avais pr√©dit. ~~Leafs en 5. Leafs en 6.~~ Canadiens en 7.

This surpasses the Halak run as we humiliated the Leafs.

Good job!
I am equally satisfied between watching the habs win as I am watching my leaf fans heads implode...
On a clench√© un club qui choke d'ann√©es en ann√©es, sans leur capitaine, Muzzin et un goaler de second plan.  En 7 games. 
√áa sent la coupe !
theorie:  L'Ontario est encore confinee.  ce fut une exception d'avoir 550 spectateurs a ce match, et d'ailleurs c'etaient tous des travailleurs de la sant√© invit√©s par le PM...
ceci etant dit, c'est plus payant pour la ligue d'avoir Montreal en series car il y a des billets qui se vendent.  
Allons encore plus loin dans la theorie... partage de revenus avec les equipes elimin√©es ?!
tout ca prit en compte, si le reste du canada ne deconfine pas... Montreal en finale de la coupe, perd en 7 matchs.
Passe de cash; la ligue est contente
Retour du Hockey au centre Bell; Les fans sont contents
Canadiens perdent la coupe en finale; tout le reste de la ligue est contente.
c'est ca du "win-win" ?
On se rassure comme on peut. C'est impressionant les strat√©gies cognitives d√©ploy√©es pour s'√©viter de souffrir.
The 2014 run was great too. If Kreider didnt injure Price, Habs wouldve been in the finals.
Humiliating Crosby was more satisfying imo
They weren't wrong
Campbell a ete excellent. Il a eu de meilleures stats que Price. Dafuk you talking about.
Wow, incroyable que je n‚Äôai pas vu cette conspiration majeure pour favoriser le CH plut√¥t que les Leafs /s

I‚Äôm a Vermonter here only live 90 minutes from Montreal. It‚Äôs been 21 months since I have been to Canada and we have missed it so so much. We ussalt come up for NYE and my birthday which is Halloween every year on top of truly a half dozen or more sporadic weekend trips and multiple day trips. We are finally coming to Montreal this weekend and can‚Äôt wait üò≠.
yesss baby
I thought they went bankrupt!
I used to take it all the time between Ottawa and Montreal, will that be the case in the (near) future?
How cheeper is it compared to flying?
My friend was a driver on this route for years. He loved spending every second night in NYC!
Is it worth taking the bus for a quick 3 day trip to NYC ?

That‚Äôs not good, greyhound is a horrible company
I wonder if the Adirondack train line is planned for a reopening too?

Welcome back!
Happy to have you, welcome back :)
Happy to have you back! Is there any good places to visit the opposite direction? I'm from the UK and the U.S. is still novel to me, would love to visit a bit more now things are open again. Taking a day trip on a bus to the U.S. is a really fun idea.
> I thought they went bankrupt!
Greyhound shut down their Canadian division, but cross-border routes were not operated by the Canadian division.
~$150-$200 bus round trip vs $320-$500 flying
edit: also, there's no need for a covid test when entering the US by bus.
What I've done numerous times in the past is drive down to Albany, park the car for a long weekend, and take the Greyhound all the way to NYC. It's a budget-friendly and easier way to travel so you're not driving or in a bus for more than 6 hours.
(edit: deleted extra words)
That's only because the train service between Mtl and NYC is woefully deficient. Otherwise it'd be Flight>Train>Rideshare>Drive>...>Bus. And if we had a bullet train, it'd be Train>Flight>Rideshare...
It's so fucking bad. Last time I took the bus we had seats made out of cement and I was stuck next to a large guy that hogged the arm rest for 7 hours. Never again.
They've been acquired by FlixBus a few days ago. Maybe they'll change.
Okay stay locked up
Walgreens offers PCR tests for free.

Ah man!
Thanks for the info!
Id wager that flying despite being more expensive, is still worth it over the bus. Montreal to my home town took my mom over 24 hours, when it‚Äôs a 3 hour flight and 10 hour drive. Then again some people don‚Äôt have a choice.
Take the train from Albany!
Where do you park the car?
> And if we had a bullet train
If ever there was a country that was designed for bullet trains, it's Canada.
The train is terribly slow but it is considerably more comfortable and enjoyable than the bus even if it takes several hours more.
if the train ran over night, I'd never fly. Flying is awful. But 12 hours on a train with a bed is not awful at all. And doing Gare Central to Penn Station is so much nicer than going to the airport, wasting time at the airport, being inside a plane for more than 5 minutes, then being in another far away airport, and getting from said far away airport to Manhattan.
Is flight really that good though?
Going to NYC - let's say you have a 22:00 flight. That means be at Trudeau Airport at 20:00, probably leave your home around 19:15.
Arrive at 23:00 in NYC - let's hope it's at Guardia or JFK - wait for baggage, get into town (train & bus stop you right downtown). Assuming you're staying somewhere close to Manhattan (Bronx, maybe) - it'll take you another hour to arrive. So say 5hrs door to door - which isn't so much better than the other options... 
And at that time you're not fighting traffic to get to Mtl's Airport or into NYC from the airports. Also hoping for no flight delays. Also not assuming we're arriving into Newark airport. 
And nevermind flying is the most expensive... 
IMO Drive>Train>Flight>Bus.
Rideshare? If I'm going with friends - sure. But do people really cross the border with random rideshare people of kijiji out whatever site?
I'd be worried about crossing the border with strangers in my car... People who have done it - How'd it go?
I rode the Greyhound bus to Boston before covid and it wasn't bad at all.
CVS as well
Interesting, any idea how fast the turn around is?
In practice usually 1-4 hours if you go to a COVID Express site. Yes these are PCR tests meeting Canada's standards despite the fast turnaround. They have labs in the basement of those sites.
A molecular test within 72 hours is required for arrival by air or land.
of course flying makes more sense outside of the MTL-NYC corridor.
Ooo I haven't even thought about that. How long is the ride? I've done NYC to Montreal before. As nice as it was, it killed a whole day T__T
There's a multi-level parking just a block or two from the Greyhound station, it was about $21 USD for 3 days back when I went down regularly.
Couldn‚Äôt agree more, iirc half the fucking population of the country lives on the Quebec City-Windsor corridor, it boggles my mind that we haven‚Äôt seized the opportunity. Instead we‚Äôre stuck with Via sharing freight lines causing perpetual delays, on 75 year old train stock‚Ä¶
Yes and no.  Our extreme shifts in temperature and difficult winter weather make the technology hard to implement.  Tunnelling might help relieve that problem, but that adds an expense that our relatively small population can't afford.
Honestly, traditional train service that was more frequent, and on it's own set of tracks (that aren't beat to shit by heavy freight) would be a big improvement.  When I used to commute to Montreal, the train was a no-brainer.  Even with the stops, it was faster than driving, plus I didn't arrive exhausted from fighting traffic across the 401.  I had places downtown in both cities (King West in Toronto, and Griffintown in Montreal), so it was super convenient since it was a couple subway stops or a $15 cab ride...
The only other thing I would have preferred is if there were two 'express commuter' trains a day - one departing at 6am and arriving at 10am, and another departing at 6pm arriving at 10pm, with no stops.
Yes, bring board games and once the train is on the US side you can drink beers to pass time!
Pre covid j'allais √† New York assez r√©guli√®rement (depuis une 20taine d'ann√©es). J'ai pris tous les moyens de transports et l'autobus est de loin l'exp√©rience la moins le fun. Oui j'en ai pogn√© des pas pires, mais en moyenne c'√©tait des rides pas super agr√©ables, surtout post 9/11 avec les contr√¥les frontaliers interminables (quoique c'est pas rare que √ßa brette avec le train aussi, mais au moins t'es confo).
Faut choisir selon les circonstances √©videment. Des fois t'es pas press√© et le train fait l'affaire. Des fois t'as moins de sous et le bus est appropri√©. L'avion c'est vraiment pas si pire m√™me avec l'attente, mais faut que le deal soit vraiment bon pour que ce soit int√©ressant.
J'aimerais essayer un mode hybride la prochaine fois, genre conduire jusqu'√† Albany et prendre le bus de l√†, quelque chose du genre. Mais je sais pas quand √ßa va arriver, je suis pas press√©e d'aller visiter nos voisins du sud en ce moment mettons.
DO CVS sometimes they get me my test back within less than 24 hours, but sign up early as possible
Yep get your test on the way down on Friday in Plattsburgh etc and have the results back by Sunday for return
I now have flashbacks from the Albany bus station and the mandatory stop any buses are doing there. Ughh.
About 3hr to Penn Station. Last few trips to NYC we just drove all the way I got street parking or the hotel offered a good rate (no exit) for around 25$ a day. EZ- Pass is highly suggested for tolls.
Honn√™tement j‚Äô√©tais pas sure of the idea du REV, c‚Äôest tellement un love-hate entre les automobilistes √† Montr√©al, *mais* cet √©t√© I used the shit out of it, I felt safer as a cyclist, I felt less annoyed as a driver, and it was really cool to see St Denis looking more.. human. 
I‚Äôll take the REV and Madame Plante‚Äôs cycling infrastructure over Coderre‚Äôs which amounted to ‚Äúpainted lines‚Äù (where you still can easily be at risk from dangerous drivers)
tldr: I was scared for the longest time to cycle all across the city, with Plante‚Äôs new infrastructure, myself and many other people are now happily cycling across the city safely and far more frequently than before.
Mais personne l'utilise! /s
I use it daily. I go 15 minutes out of my way to use it because it‚Äôs just so much safer than my normal route. Hopefully we can see more of this infrastructure in the near future. 
‚Ä¶ Maybe take down the stupid fence on acadie and add it there..? Pls..?
le REV c'est du gaspillage! On aurait pu s'ajeter un stade de baseball avec toute cet argent l√†!
heureusement coderre va revenir √† la mairie et ramener le parking et les banlieusards avec lui

\- un frustr√© surement
Timing impeccable pour le d√©bat de ce soir. J'ai bien h√¢te de voir Coderre chier sur le REV alors que ce jalon important a √©t√© franchi aujourd'hui m√™me!
Toute ma reconnaissance aux gens qui ont con√ßus ce tron√ßon. Efficace, rapide. s√©curitaire. LEs chiffres le prouve.
Coderre n'osera jamais d√©manteler cette piste si il est √©lu... m√™me si c'est pas l'envie qui lui manque.
Yep, it‚Äôs great, love taking the REV. I biked all through last year, even winter, and the bike infrastructure like this made it easy.
Avant le REV j'avais souvent des probl√®mes avec des automobilistes qui frolent, etc ce qui ne m'incitais pas √† rejoindre le centre ville en v√©lo. Maintenant c'est bien mais il manque cruellement un REV au centre-ville, pas cette piste cyclable pitoyable sur Maisonneuve dans l'angle mort gauche des voitures qui a n√©c√©ssit√© des feux de circulation distinct et en plus non synchronis√© donc stop and go √† toutes les deux secondes, c'est lassant...
It's one of the best lanes in the city now! barely affects parking, separates everyone. And makes it super safe & direct to go north in the city. Hopefully it helps start a push for more lanes like it.
Pour vrai, j'ai commenc√© √† vraiment utilis√© ma bicyclette cette √©t√©, et j'ai ador√© le REV.
Belle r√©alisation.
J'ai travaill√© sur la construction 3 mois, comme ma job fut annul√© √† cause de la covid...eux, √† 90%, non pas aim√© le REV! ):
Ce samedi on fait une balade de v√©lo pour c√©lebrer et exiger qu'on garde la piste sur bellechasse! https://www.facebook.com/events/1264360227337885
That's awesome. I'd love to know how many cars use the street as well in the same time period. But then again, it's not like anyone looks at pedestrian counts versus car counts as an argument for abolishing sidewalks. So maybe it's all just a moot point. Roads, sidewalks, and separated bike lanes everywhere, so everyone can enjoy getting around how they wish. What a concept!
Ne vous laissez pas distraire par un propri√©taire italien volubile qui a perdu sa place de stationnement; la piste cyclable sur Bellechasse est √©galement abondamment utilis√©e.
That's amazing !
Un peu forc√© comme franglais, mais bon to each his own.
cette ann√©e c'est la premi√®re fois que je roule en v√©lo √† montr√©al, j'avais trop peur avant.  ces pistes cyclables comme le REV changent tout!!
I'm the same. I never rode in the city before due to fear. I moved to the east end  the Rev is amazing!!!! Got a bixi membership and rode everywhere
its the same dude doing a million trips /s
Pis √ßa me d√©range pour les deux fois par ann√©e que je me rend sur St-Denis en partant de Terrebonne /s
Et l'hiver, on y pense √† l'hiver? Il neige et fait - 20 8mois de l'ann√©e! /s
Faut arr√™ter de construire des piss cyclables! /s
I used it quite a bit this summer on the weekends and it is awesome. It is an amazingly safe way to cross the island in long bike rides. I hope it ends up being a model that gets repeated all over the island and not just an oddity.
Yes, it would be amazing, maybe they could turn it into a bike path
15 min sur combien de temps de transit pour le fun?
Avec une course aussi svp
Coderre va nous sauver avec le parc sur D√©carie. Les enfants vont pouvoir jouer entre le traffic de la voie de service

√áa c'est le plus gros point √† apporter. Une des raisons qu'il n'y a pas autant de cyclistes est que plusieurs craignent pour leur s√©curit√©. Des infrastructures comme le REV permettent aux cyclistes plus "casual" de circuler en ville. En apportant ces changements, on peut voir une augmentation de l'utilisation du v√©lo, et avec le prix de l'essence qui continue de monter, c'est un bon timing.
Course de v√©los sur le REV √ßa serait nice, parfois le matin √ßa semble d√©j√† √™tre le cas hahaa
J'aime mieux rouler sur Sherbrooke, c'est presque moins dangereux et au moins c'est synchronis√©

Mais tu fais quand m√™me un tldr qui fait la moiti√© du texte initial. Tu as ptetre juste du mal √† synth√©tiser tes id√©es ;)
Je travail dans la division cr√©dit entreprise immobilier d'une grande banque et sur mon bureau √† tout les jours il y passe des entreprises qui demandent du cr√©dit pour des r√©novations mais aussi que l'un des poste de d√©pense qui justifie le chiffre de la demande est le co√ªt de maintenir un logement vide pendant 1 an et le co√ªt des √©victions. Le stratag√®me que je connais et que j'observe le plus fr√©quent c'est une √©viction pour travaux majeur et le maintient des lieux vacants. 
J'ai d√©ja lu l'historique d'une soci√©t√© qui a √©vinc√© plus de 800 logements majoritairement des 5 1/2 pour en faire des loft et des 3 1/2 de luxe. Sa dette immobill√®re √©tait astronomique mais aussi 15% √©tait en co√ªt d'opportunit√©. 
C'est franchement d√©solant que l'on laisse autant le march√© et l'app√¢t du gain g√¢cher autant de vies humaines. 
Si je gagne √† la loterie je me pars une soci√©t√© d'investissement immobili√®re qui vise √† aqui√©rir des plex et les transformer en coop√©rative. Habitants-propri√©taires, tel que les choses devraient √™tre!
Faut faire une distinction entre les ententes dans lesquels le locataire re√ßoit plusieurs milliers de dollars pour partir, VS les proprios qui brisent des bails sans compensation sur la base de mensonges. 
Quand tu acceptes $XXXX du proprio pour partir, l'entente est que le locataire r√©silie volontairement le bail. Donc, le proprio peut faire ce qu'il veut avec l'appartement.
> Ces chiffres proviennent d‚Äôune enqu√™te du Comit√© logement de La Petite-Patrie ...  organisme de d√©fense des droits des locataires
Meanwhile in FL, you can start an eviction process if the rent is more than 5 days late. lol.

C'est √©vident que les r√®gles de la R√©gie sont un d√©sastre, et ne fonctionnent ni pour les propri√©taires, ni les locataires, sauf une petite minorit√©. Le controle des loyers est un d√©sastre, comme dans chaque jurisdiction ou ca a √©t√© impl√©ment√©.
Quand en 2019 un propri√©taire est pris avec un loyer de 445$ par mois pour un apartement, c'est **impossible** de le maintenir en bon √©tat. Le propri√©taire l'a relou√© ensuite pour 1590$ par mois, ca veut dire que ce propri√©taire avait un co√ªt d'opportunit√© de plus de 1000$ par mois sur ce seul logement. C'est clairement insoutenable.
Le contr√¥le des loyers profite a une petite minorit√© plus ag√©e, au d√©triment de la majorit√© et particuli√®rement les jeunes familles, qui eux doivent payer plus cher pour des appartements minuscules, parce que les app√¢rtement de tailles familiales sont occup√©s a rabais, du au controle des loyers, par des personnes seules dont les enfants sont longtemps partis.
Connaissez-vous un politicien avec un plan r√©aliste et une volont√© cr√©dible de s'attaquer au probl√®me?
Est-ce qu‚Äôil y a quel-quns qui peut ma tranduire?
That tracks for me. Every eviction I know of was fraudulent.
Mon proprio m'a signifi√© qu'il allait reprendre mon logement en 2024, pour y vivre lui meme.
Pas mal sur que c'est une r√©noviction d√©guis√©e etant donn√© le montant de mon loyer, mais je peux faire fuck all.
Can‚Äôt trust a single word TVA says. Totally corrupt
Imagine acheter une maison seul alors que tu travailles au salaire minimum... PAs COMPLIQU√â STAFFAIRE!!!! T'as juste √† manger du riz trois fois par jour pendant 25 ans en vivant dans un trou √† rat, si tu ne te fait pas r√©novicter, et √† payer une hypoth√®que pendant 30 ans en travaillant fort 80 heures par semaine sous la table. Rendu l√† tu profitera de ta lib√©ration financi√®re. Tu vas peut-√™tre avoir 68 ans et mourir √† 75, mais au moins tu ne seras plus un fardeau pour les bon propri√©taire d'entreprises et de d'immobilier qui paye tes maudits service sociaux de BS.
Oh wait, ces sales pauvre m√©ritent pas de vivre sauf pour √™tre exploit√©. Ils n'avaient tout simplement qu'√† faire les bons choix √† 16 ans.
&#x200B;
Vraiment, les pauvre ne devrait pas avoir le droit de se reproduire. C'est immoral.
So what? What I take away from this is that when you own property you should be able to do what you want with it. Don‚Äôt like it? Don‚Äôt rent someone else‚Äôs property and buy your own.
Edit: Fools, clearly if so many evictions are fraudulent then there needs to be a change in the rules that more easily allows people to reclaim their property. It‚Äôs happening whether people like it or not, might as well adjust the regulations so things can be done more equitably. All of western society is based on free market capitalism, but you wanna socialize housing? Lol, good luck.
C'est des renoviction et c'est d√©ja un probl√®me majeur a NY
Un march√© de l'immobillier n√©cessairement garantie une p√©nurie permanente d'immobillier. 
Le march√© EST le probl√®me.

Merci pour l'info! C'est triste en effet
You're a good man.
Mais si personne n'ach√®te ces lofts ou 3 1/2 de luxe, l'entreprise serait en perte.
Le "march√©" ne fonctionne pas dans le vide. R√©nover des 5 1/2 ne va pas te rapporter de l'argent √† coup sure. √áa fonctionne seulement quand il y a de la demande pour cela, notamment aujourd'hui des jeunes professionnels.
Exactement.

Ayoye.
Sauf que quand √ßa vient apr√®s des mois de harc√®lement, est-ce que c'est vraiment valable ?
Une entente apr√®s 9 mois d'harcelement est-ce vraiment une entente?
Donc statistiquement √ßa vaut rien. Les gens qui savent pourquoi ils ont eu une √©viction justifi√©e ne vont g√©n√©ralement pas contacter les organismes locaux pour aider √† la disputer.
Wouldn‚Äôt the most precise numbers come from the r√©gie?

oui c'est pour √ßa qu'ils citent des chiffres d'Alberta
C'est effectivement biais√© statistiquement, mais √ßa prends pas un doc en math pour comprendre qu'un proprio normal fait une reprise de logement tous les 15/20 ans (habiter soit-m√™me, loger les enfants ou les vieux) alors qu'un fraudeur fait de multiples reprises par ann√©es et que par cons√©quent une douzaine de proprio √©crase largement des centaines de proprio sans probl√®mes
You can open a dossier at the regie du logement in Montr√©al if the rent is 1 day late as well.
Florida is a state with laws taylored for swindlers and crooks. For example, you cannot seize the main residence when one goes bankrupt, and the "residence" goes all the way to fixtures (lamps, faucets), which is why there is such a big market for solid-gold fixtures in Florida.
So it's not surprising that you can kick people out after 5 days, which is only 4 times faster than our 21 days here.
Story time ?
C'est triste des fois comment des gens plac√©s pour avoir de la compassion n'en font pas beaucoup preuve.
C‚Äôest interdit d‚Äô√©vincer des personnes de 70 ans et plus, meme pour y loger un membre de ta famille ou pour diviser/subdiviser. D√©go√ªtant!
New York has had rent control for years, and it's the only reason the working class has the ability to live in the city. 
Montreal is vastly overpriced right now. Most renovations you are seeing are aesthetics (drywall and fixtures) whereas many properties are being listed without work done to roofs, foundations, brick...it's spelling impending disaster as people currently buying have no idea of the sunk costs.
I say this not to dismiss your point, but to say that rent control isn't the problem, but greed and speculation.
The average salary in Montreal is still around 50,000. The actual economics just can't keep up, especially with reasonable priced housing available within an hour drive.

Donc, si je comprends bien, vous √™tes en train de dire que les hauts loyers vont garantir l'acc√®s aux logements aux familles m√™me si elles ne peuvent pas se payer ces logements?
> Quand en 2019 un propri√©taire est pris avec un loyer de 445$ par mois pour un apartement, c'est impossible de le maintenir en bon √©tat.
En quoi c'est impossible? T'as le droit de monter le loyer en fonction du montant investi en r√©novation. C'est faux d'insinuer que les proprio ne sont pas capable de se payer les r√©novations n√©cessaires √† leur building sans faire de passe croche.
> Le propri√©taire l'a relou√© ensuite pour 1590$ par mois, ca veut dire que ce propri√©taire avait un co√ªt d'opportunit√© de plus de 1000$ par mois sur ce seul logement. C'est clairement insoutenable.
Un co√ªt d'opportunit√©!? Haha, c'est une belle fa√ßon de dire que c'est en-dessous de la valeur du march√©. Mais c'est pas un co√ªt voyons donc!
Mais t'as raison sur un point. C'est bel et bien le contr√¥le des loyers qui est √† l'origine du ph√©nom√®ne d√©crit dans l'article. 
La hausse fulgurante des loyers √† Montr√©al, le ph√©nom√®ne des r√©no-√©victions et les profits faramineux de compagnies de flip viennent du fait que les loyers ne refl√®tent pas la valeur du march√©. Notamment parce que,  selon les r√®gles √©tablies, un changement √† la valeur sur march√© d'un habitation n'est pas un pr√©texte valide pour augmenter un loyer.
On est arriv√© √† un point o√π la diff√©rence entre la valeur sur le march√© et le prix pay√© est tellement grand que les compagnies de flip immobili√®re font litt√©ralement des √©victions ill√©gales leur mod√®le d'affaire.
D√®s que √ßa touche aux habitations (ie un haut % du portfolio de beaucoup de gens) personne ne dit rien sauf de vagues commentaires.
QS sont probablement ceux qui chialerait le plus.

Bin voyons donc, c'est pas vrai √ßa, tu as des recours! De un, l'avis de ton propri√©taire fait 4 ans d'avance a aucune impact sur ton bail. Il doit le faire 6 mois avant la fin de ton bail (donc habituellement en d√©cembre). Il doit te faire parvenir un avis √©crit qui suit le mod√®le du TAL et tu peux lui r√©pondre par √©crit que tu contestes. Apr√®s √ßa, il va devoir intenter un recours au TAL pour justifier son √©viction.
Ensuite, il va te devoir 3 mois de loyer et les frais de ton d√©m√©nagement, et √ßa m√™me si tu contestes. Tu peux aussi demander des dommages suppl√©mentaires si tu r√©ussis √† le prouver.
Finalement, si tu finis par √™tre √©vinc√©, t'as tout int√©r√™t √† v√©rifier dans l'ann√©e qui suit qui habite l√†.

S'il le loue dans l'ann√©e qui suit o√π qu'il y habite pas alors qu'il t'avais dit vouloir y habiter, t'as un recours possible au TAL pour demander √† ravoir ton logement et obtenir des dommages-int√©r√™ts.

What a strange way to see it. 
If you're renting property, I'd go out on a limb and say you PROBABLY don't have the means to just.. "go out and buy your own".
Your point of view applied to any other rental situation might make you realize how inconsiderate it is of others :
Say we had an agreement for you to "rent" 12 seasons of a TV show from me, but before you could even get to the 8th season, I forced you to give me back all the DVDs.
Sure , you're mad that you didnt get the chance to finish the TV show, but you should have gone out and bought it yourself if you really wanted to watch it. Right?
Absolutely not, the right of property, as every other right including the freedom of speech, comes with limitations to make it viable in a society.
Is this some ‚Äúpull yourself from the bootstraps‚Äù mentality ?
You‚Äôre joking right? Not everyone can afford property. Also investments aren‚Äôt a guaranteed return. No investment is. Why do landlords feel this specific type of investment has the right to max returns all the time without taking into account the lives of people.
Are you stupid?
When you rent out a place, you have temporarily relinquished the rights to that place in exchange for money. There is a legal infrastructure to abide by.
It's a bit disconnected.  If you walk around this city and look at it, the majority of the people can't afford to own a home.  
Same applies the other way too.  If you want to get into the renting game, you need to follow the rules.

Yeah, you should definitely start by punching yourself first!
Et Martini & Rossi il semble.
√áa a chang√©? Il me semble qu‚Äôon filme 10 fois plus maintenant.
personne avait de chars? Le vieux Montr√©al √©tait un parking a la grandeur... le Champ-de-mars √©tait un Parking.. le parc avec la statue de Drapeau aussi...
Then why especially older people always complain about biking or construction of bike paths if they all grew up with walking and riding bicycles
[Et la P'tite Vie](https://i.imgur.com/H7MzIDB.png)
avec des t√©l√©phone... l'√©quipe de Radio-canada devait avoir une tr√®s grosse cam√©ra a cette √©poque
Back then almost all the infrastructure was new, so none of it needed construction. There were no bikes path, you were happily sharing the roads with drunk drivers, everybody got along (and deaths didn't matter).
Because societies evolve and nowadays everybody has cars?
Not sure what point you were trying to make. 
I know this might seem crazy, but people change over time
So now they complain because the newer generation is living more comfortably ?
As is tradition.
36% participation...is pathetic üòë
Tout ce qui est en gris sont des arrondissements d√©fusionn√©s par le gouvernent lib√©ral de Jean Charest, principalement Anglo/lib√©ral.
La d√©fusion des arrondissements a directement men√© √† un parti comme Projet Montr√©al de prendre du galon face au type de gouvernance √† la G√©rald Tremblay et Denis Coderre de ce monde.
Donc pour une rare fois, merci Jean Charest
CDN-NDG a d√©sormais une mairesse de Projet Montr√©al.
Dehors Perez!
Why does Saint-Laurent vote so overwhelmingly for Denis Coderre? Like what's the appeal for this borough? I live there and do not get it but I only moved there a few years ago so maybe someone with more MTL-knowledge can explain it to me?
Pas mal d√©√ßue par mon hood, RDP-PAT.  I mean come on.   Depuis que Plante est l√†, on voit certaines am√©liorations au niveau des transports en commun pis de la s√©curit√© des grandes rues, quelque chose qui aurait probablement √©t√© renvers√© avec Coderre.   (Je parle surtout de RDP, je ne visite pas souvent PAT)
Here‚Äôs a interactive map from CTV Montreal if like to look at more details
https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/mobile/interactive-map-montreal-municipal-election-results-2021-1.5650527
WTF Montreal-Nord? Vous pensiez vraiment que l‚Äôautre allait avoir la moindre pens√©e pour vous?
√éle Biz went fully Coderre. This graphic is wrong.
I know someone who lives on the West Island. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like Plante.  She took away all the parking and now there are bikes everywhere. Not safe!‚Äù
Too bad your city de-merged or you could have been a part of the process to chose Montr√©al‚Äôs mayor. ;)
I‚Äôd be curious to see this map with the % of vote that went to the candidate, like that purple map of the USA; no state was 100% red or blue.
L‚Äô√©chelle (20km) sert √† quoi, exactement?
I see the heartland/hinterland rule is at play here.
Pas une fois j'ai entendu qqun m√™me mentionner la date pour voter
Pas du tout surpris par RDP-PAT pis leur petite bulle de banlieusards isol√©s de marde. Ils ont d√ª √™tre les premiers √† chialer √† dire que "y'a pu de places de stationnement √† cause de toutes les osti d'piss cyclabes!"
Qu'ils restent donc dans leurs maudits nuages de fum√©e de raffineries... Pendant ce temps, le reste de la ville va continuer √† se promener en becik pour aller tavailler et faire des commissions.
EDIT: Ah ben je ravale mes paroles. On dirait que Projet Montr√©al a √©t√© √©lu finalement. Je suis bien content.
Certains analystes ont mentionn√© que le taux de participation est g√©n√©ralement plus bas quand une √©lection survient juste apr√®s une autre.
Dans ce cas ci, les gens sont d√©j√† br√ªl√© √† cause de l'√©lection f√©d√©rale.
37% üò∏, 42% last time
√áa me tentait vraiment pas, mais j'ai fait un effort pour aider qu'on se d√©barrasse de Coderre encore.
As someone who worked at the elections this weekend. I didnt complain about the participation as I got to do all my school work for the week + watch the whole F1 Grand Prix with the amount of free time we had lol. To be fair though, the process to register to vote, especially if you have recently moved or have any different circumstance is an extreme pain in the ass. I dont understand why they make you jump through so many hoops just to do your civil duty, as theyre basically convincing people that dont have unlimited free time not to come.
Ben honn√™tement une grande parti de l'√©lectorat est juste peu repr√©sent√© dans les 3 partis qui √©taient en lice.
Te rappels tu quand Ralliement pour Montr√©al (la 4i√®me option) s'est fusionn√© √† Mouvement Montr√©al pour au final juste dispara√Ætre parce qu'au lieux de devenir un parti unificateur, Mouvement Montr√©al c'est devenu un parti qui pr√¥nait la secession avec les racines fran√ßaises de la ville. Et depuis ce moment l√† le parti a stagn√© dans les sondages parce que lol Montr√©al c'est pas Toronto.
Quel gros fail.
Et puis apr√®s tu as Fr√©d√©ric Bastien qui s'est ouvertement mis a supporter Denis Coderre vu qu'il s'est mis d'avant comme √©tant le seul a mentionn√© le fait fran√ßais...
Quel d√©sastre.
Le choix entre le ROC, le lib√©ral f√©d√©ral r√©usin√© ou QS au municipale √ßa attire pas l'√©lectorat.
Reste qui?
Gilbert Thibodeau ou rester chez vous.
lol
64% veut rien savoir.
Including me.. 36.1%
C'√©tait une grosse erreur parcontre dans un sens car √† voir la gestion de ces anciennes villes et du reste des arrondissements c'est 2 mondes diff√©rent, ils ne pensent pas de la m√™me fa√ßon et ne sont pas g√©r√© de la m√™me fa√ßon et ce encore aujourd'hui.
En passant tu savais que G√©rald Tremblay en fait gouvernait \*\*\*\* all c'√©tait Zampino carr√©ment qui fesait tout.
Ben √ßa fait que les quartiers les plus riches payent aucunement l'infra de Montr√©al qu'ils utilisent.
Donc les plus riches gardent l'argent a proximit√© de leur r√©sidences exclusives.
Tu le remercieras aussi pour Royalmount.
CDN-NDG and Ville Marie are 30% francophone at best, votes Liberal by dictator-level margins, and went Plante. Montreal Nord and RDP are more than 67% francophone, in some parts is competitive for CAQ, and went Coderre.
Christ. We're not all running over cyclists in our SUVs because we're reading the latest Robert Libman article in the Gazette. A big reason Plante gained in her vote is because she recognized her party wasn't very diverse and made efforts to reach out beyond her base on the Plateau to sell her platform to other areas. She's going to accomplish more in the city because of this.
oh je ne savais pas qu'ils comptaient encore, j'√©tais vrm d√©√ßu de voir Perez le gagnant
Best news du midi pour moi. Amen.
Mainly Anglos and people who love their cars. It's my experience at least.
I live here. While I'm sure Mayor Desousa has skeletons in his closet, in my experiences with him he's been approachable and effective. In terms of ecology and stuff like bike lanes, he's probably closer to Plante than Coderre, though I'd like him to go further. I think people just voted for the well known incumbent who's been doing an OK job.
I think a lot of people in Saint-Laurent use cars to move around and with Val√©rie Plante being less pro-motorist, people there were afraid to have her elected
They‚Äôre all car-dependent condo and SFH dwellers.
Elle est pas mal moins populaire chez les anglos et les allos, la mentalit√© plus banlieusarde.
Ce n'est pas sous Plante justement qu'il y a eu une belle promenade r√©nov√©e dans le Vieux PAT sur St-Jean-Baptiste pour remettre le quartier en valeur?
RDP a flipp√©?!
the map is inaccurate.
https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/interactive-map-montreal-municipal-election-results-2021-1.5650527
Denis Coderre a grandit √† Montr√©al-Nord et c‚Äôest son ch√¢teau fort.
And Lasalle has its own party, not Plante. She actually finished in 3rd place there.
C'est juste les votes pour maire, mais par arrondissement. Pas les mairies d'arrondissement.
That would make a lot more sense.
Lol finalement Caroline Bourgeois de PM a √©t√© r√©√©lue. T'as parl√© trop t√¥t √† la Marie-Jos√©e Savard!
Ooohhh le jaloux, comme il est mignon!!!
Ah oui, ben √©puisant aller voter.
√áa fait un mois qu'on a eu un √©lection f√©d√©rale.
C'est pas un excuse.
Same lol. Premi√®re fois que je vote et j'suis super content qu'elle aie gagn√©!
> Coderre encore.
LOL! Plus difficile de s'en d√©barrasser que des zombies! 
Luc Ferrandez √† mentionn√© hier soir que Coderre ne r√©alisera pas son r√™ve du de devenir le jean Drapeau du 21e si√®cle! 
V√©rification faite: Je ne savais pas que Drapeau avait gagn√© en 1954, perdu en 1957, redevenu maire en 1960 et a sieg√© jusqu'a 1986!
It does seem like a hassle. I recently moved, and I was scolding my local friends for their apathy until they showed me the pamphlet with the multi-step process to register.
>Le choix entre le ROC, le lib√©ral f√©d√©ral r√©usin√© ou QS au municipale √ßa attire pas l'√©lectorat.
C'est en effet d√©solant de ne pas avoir un Michel Br√ªl√© pour repr√©senter tes int√©r√™ts. Ce que t'as √©num√©r√© par contre, √ßa repr√©sente la grande majorit√© de Montr√©al, mon cher. 
C'est plus d√ª au fait que les enjeux des √©lections municipales int√©ressent moins aux gens que celles des f√©d√©rales et des provinciales. √áa a toujours √©t√© le cas √† Montr√©al o√π les pouvoirs municipaux sont relativement limit√©s.
J'utilisais le titre de maire, ch√© ben que Zampino √©tait le boss
Pour avoir grandi dans DDO, √ßa manque pas de scandales l√† non plus, mais je vois ce que tu veux dire.
C'est une erreur sur plusieurs plans, mais vraisemblablement, le 10% de population qui habite aurait pu faire la diff√©rence √† plusieurs reprises
√Ä noter
Je ne suis pas pour la d√©fusion
J'dis juste qu'il y a une certaine ironie √† tout √ßa
Oui mais les riches payent genre 70% des imp√¥ts f√©d√©rales et provinciales pour des services qu'ils n'utilisent pas non plus.
Vraiment cool pour les personnes √† mobilit√© r√©duite, √¢g√©es ou m√™me avec un jeune enfant!
D√©tails du projet pilote de navettes autonomes dans [ce post](https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/pgm3yf/projet_pilote_de_navettes_autonomes_%C3%A9lectriques/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).
Les navettes sont habituellement b√¢ch√©es et stationn√©es derri√®re des grilles sur le parking de la rue Saint-Andr√©, vers Jean-Talon.
**EDIT:**  
Je viens de trouver l'article officiel de la ville √† propos du projet.  
[montreal.ca - Un projet pilote de navettes √©lectriques autonomes sur la Plaza Saint-Hubert](https://montreal.ca/articles/un-projet-pilote-de-navettes-electriques-autonomes-sur-la-plaza-saint-hubert-19054)
15km/h, roll cage de char de Nascar üòÉ
Cute!
je peux crosspost sur r/electricvehicles ? Ca va les faire tripper (un peu).
C'est bien comme projet mais je pense qu'ils auraient d√ª mettre plut√¥t de l'argent pour attirer des commerces qui ne sont pas des friperies ou de la vente de robes de mariage
C'est tu le m√™me groupe propulseur que la petite navette √©lectrique au vieux Qu√©bec? Il en arrachait dans les pentes celui l√† lol
[Mr Car?](https://youtu.be/-trd_f6j3eI)
Je savais pas que Playmobil faisait des vrais v√©hicules (aussi lettes que les jouets).
Parfait, on pourra transporter 5 personne √† la place de 50 personnes compar√© a un bus conventionel.
√âgalement le gang qui ne skip pas leg day.
Je suis d'accord, mais je regrette qu'elle ne se rende pas √† Bellechasse.
>Les navettes sont habituellement b√¢ch√©es
Moi j'aurais ben t'trop la chienne que √ßa pogne dans le vent pis que √ßa d√©calisse cette histoire-l√† lol !
√áa vire sur un trente sous, mais √ßa flip sur un dix cents!
Attends que √ßa reste stall√© dans un nid de poule ou qu'un √©cureuil vire √ßa √† l'envers ü§≠
Les commerces commencent d√©j√† √† changer, mais plut√¥t du c√¥t√© du m√©tro Beaubien pour le moment.
Pas mal de locaux vacants c√¥t√© Jean-Talon, √ßa devrait changer dans les prochaines ann√©es.
Quess√© que t'a contre les robes de mari√©es jaunies 48+ double KK?
Il n'y a aucune pente sur ce tron√ßon de rue. √áa devrait aller...
Ah oui! J'ai d√©j√† √©t√© dans une qui arrivait pas √† monter une c√¥te mais je me souviens plus laquelle. De La Montague p-√™. En tout cas, il avait fallu sortir. Mais pareil... Qu√©bec c'est rien que √ßa des batinse de grosses c√¥tes. C'√©tait tout un plan de sans-dessein de faire rouler √ßa l√†. Aussi on dirait qu'ils les avaient test√©es √† vide?
C'est un projet pilote avec diff√©rentes intentions qu'un bus...On parle ici d'une boucle de seulement 2km...

So you want the first autonomous vehicles in city to go 50 km/hr with 50 people aboard going all around the city? You need pilot projects to show the technology can work in this setting first.
Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire? Ils vont p√©daler en-dessous comme Fred Caillou?
Haha! Bin des vid√©os √† venir donc!
LOL pour le nid de poule
Sont tellement autonome qu' elles sont rest√©es prisent entre deux grillages de fa√ßon autonome!
Elles vont se perdent de fa√ßon autonome aussi!
Vive l'auto- nomie!
en esperant que les loyers soient raisonables.
t'es rack√© raide apres une seance de squat si c'est pas Leg day Everyday.
Ouin tout devrait rester comme dans MON temps. Avant que j'arrive sur la terre c'√©tait poche pis maintenant tout ce qui est nouveau est poche (surtout si je veux pas faire l'effort de comprendre)
Pis ceux qui vont moins vite que mo√© su l'autoroute c'est des peperes pis ceux qui vont plus vite que mo√© c'est des malades Ya juste mo√© pis mon √©poque qui est correct!
Hmmm. J'ai juste le temps de faire un bon leg day le samedi apr√®s une s√©ance de spinning pis je suis pas rack√©e ni le dimanche ni apr√®s. C'est p-√™ le spinning? Ou la routine d'√©tirements apr√®s? Ou parce que je suis vieille pis qu'un moment donn√© la carcasse se fait √† l'id√©e que c'est √ßa qui est √ßa?
priorit√© h√©h√©
Je crois que beaucoup de gens ici ne comprennent pas l'humour et prennent tout au premier degr√©!
En passant, c'est juste une blague et je suis pour ce type de transport mais que veux-tu, ils en a qui vont toujours prendre tout au premier degr√© et se sentir √† jamais offusqu√©.
De plus, ton commentaire est bon mais il faudrait juste le diriger aux bonnes personnes...
Au final, il aurait fallu que j'√©crive en gros C'EST UNE BLAGUE.
P.s. Il faudrait que les gens se d√©gourdissent un peu!

Ben oui, ben oui!!!
Or, phrased a different way;
Montreal just had its *least* muggiest August for the rest of our lives.
Sounds about right. My hydro bill was way up due to running my AC like 24/7. Was it also the hottest August on record, or just the muggiest?
having just moved from calgary, i suffered lol
it really was hot for August...usually it's during the Dog Days that you get heat like that. I like the heat but after a while I got sick of the humidity, everything being sticky, my hair fuzzing up, etc. Glad it's OVER!
I love that every time one of these posts are about *moist* air the title uses a different synonym for moist ha ha
Also ouch i felt this humidity, I felt like a little frog in a mushroom house in a swamp :')
Even the weather is getting mugged
[deleted]
Makes one appreciate the four seasons, especially autumn.
And it's only going to get worse from here! Follow the science
now let's do a correlation between humidex and crime!
33 ain‚Äôt nothing compared to southeast America. 69 dew point on average
I like the gold medal. "We're number 1! We're number 1!"
I love how a lot of the records were years ago but now it‚Äôs global warming but when the earth was on fire back in the day it was ok.
I doubt it
It was.  I post that kind of information in /r/MontrealWxRecords/
I had to empty a part of my AC that I didn't know existed yesterday, due to the humidity filling it up with water.
42 pint Noma dehumidifier. my new favorite appliance.
I also cover Calgary weather.  They don't know how nice they have it out there.  They complain when the summer night's stay above 10¬∞C.  They set a record this year for the warmest night ever: 18.8¬∞C.  That kind of night happens about a dozen times per year in Montreal.
Get AC. I caved this year as an Edmonton transplant from a couple years back.
One morning after breakfast I got up and did as I always do ie push my chair under the table with a foot while picking up my plate etc. Well, what? It was so humid the chair sticked to the floor and I sprained a pinky.
Came in wondering if it was about muggings.
Learning words while learning about weather history is a lot more fun than expected!
and that right there is the difference between French and Qu√©b√©cois
Almost all crime happens at comfortable temperatures.  If it's too hot or too cold, most crime drops significantly.
An average dew point of 69¬∞F seems extremely high.  Where are you talking about?  Maybe Singapore, but I doubt anywhere in the US has it that high.
Is southeast America Argentina?
I love how 6/10 were since 2000 and 4/10 in last decade.
I especially love pointing it out to people who try to pretend that since a couple statistical outliers always exist rarely throughout history, a sudden large cluster of the same aberration is of absolutely no concern at all.
Number 1 and 2 and from the last 4 years, so yes, its pretty eye opening and a strong proof that we‚Äôre seeing the effects of global warming.
mugging my life force out of my body that's for sure
Je traduit pour les fran√ßais: 
Ses enfants ont une pataugeoire dans le jardin, mais c'est rendu sale parce que les gosses √©claboussent partout et ca fait de la boue.
In the last 70 years of global warming only 2 years were hotter than 1955‚Ä¶
And 69 Augusts were muggier than 1964. What's your point?
Belle photo hant√©e!
I always go there once or twice a month at night to drink alone and celebrate life's little victories lol üëÄ

Pas exactement l√†. De l'autre bord.
Close. That marina is about to be turned into a massive park.
Thanks. God willing I'll be able to do that trip this summer.
Merci
Depends on traffic. I live in lachine near this and can be downtown in 15 minutes if it's not rush hour.
J'esp√®re fort que √ßa fonctionnera.
[deleted]
Mais les riches n'ont plus de place pour leur bateaux.
Yep, lachine/lasalle really isn't much a couple blocks from the waterfront.
I grew up there too - on 18th Ave/Provost area.
Pretty cool stuff has been announced for this summer tho! Aire commune is going to be on the site of the marina open for all with kayak/sup/canoe rentals for like 10$. I also grew up in lachine and its the first time im looking forward to spending time in the borough!
How's the women?

I work in the ER so I see them often and I‚Äôve spotted more than one... and I also saw one guy with a Punisher patch, which I thought was not professional or appropriate in the current climate
> Montreal police said they are currently in the process of a "complete review" of the dress code for their officers. But they're staying tight-lipped on when the process started and how many officers have modified their uniforms.
Knowing some people in the police (not Montr√©al) it‚Äôs probably viewed as solidarity with police, while ignoring the ACTUAL meaning of the ‚Äúthin blue line. And thats still not ok. 
You don‚Äôt need a bastardization of the flag to support law enforcement. But they don‚Äôt implicitly deserve respect either. They are supposed to exist to support their community, not be a paramilitary group.
So does the Canadian thin blue line flag also look like their national flag was shot and bled to death?
Edit: yes, yes it does
https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/mp47za/des_agents_du_spvm_portent_des_%C3%A9cussons_thin_blue/
>The police service did not respond to other questions, including how  many officers have been wearing the symbol or if any have been  disciplined.
Usual SPVM shit. Zero respect for them.
√áa me f√¢chait au d√©but, mais en y repensant, si le policier a ces convictions l√†, c'est peut-√™tre mieux qu'il porte la patch pour qu'il soit facile √† reconna√Ætre.
Of course. Leave it to Montreal to overanalyze a simple symbol of brotherly solidarity for a uniquely crucial and challenging profession.
Funny most people slinging mud at them night and day wouldn't last a night or a day in their shoes.
Pampered babies.
Edit: well Commies it was fun, y'all have a good night Something you couldn't have were it not for that thin Blue line.
I walked by 3 cops yesterday and at least one of the them was wearing the 'thin blue line'. I'd be really interested for a group other than the SPVM to look into this because I totally agree that this is probably quite common and i'd love for the findings to be publicly available.
The Punisher logo is disgustingly inappropriate and I genuinely think any cop caught wearing it should face consequences. With the 'thin blue line' its problematic because it represents systemic problems with policing but you have to be somewhat in the know to see that patch and not just mistake it for a weird Canadian flag. A skull on the other hand is a very common symbol for death, which by no means a group who are supposed to be "protecting" the general public should be wearing. Let alone at a time when police killing civilians is a major societal concern.
As a white man if I had to interact with a cop wearing a skull patch, i'd definitely be freaked out & scared. I can only imagine what someone who is black, or has less societal privileges than me, would feel like interacting with a cop sporting a death insignia.
Not appropriate and also stupid because the Punisher hates legal systems that don't help anyone
Canadian BOPE
>I work in the ER so I see them often 
how would say your interactions with them are on average
That says a lot about those in  charge, the mere fact that they have to review!! Is it Police and Union issued? If not, they should be made to remove it!!!
It means they are going to wait till this blows over and do nothing
@CaptainCanUsa ..... Is there a petition out there to put these imbeciles in check? "Complete Review "??? .... utter bullshit! The public should get a vote on this since we pay for these 14 week trained up people....
‚ÄúIgnorance is no excuse‚Äù, isn‚Äôt that their thing?
Why am I held at a higher standard than the person with the gun?
So you dont ACTUALLY know, right? You're assuming this because you know some people but in the end, you have no clue other than guessing? Just wanted to clarify the weight of your comment.
Most cops wouldn‚Äôt last a day as a lawyer, a doctor, a soldier, a teacher or most other professions since that‚Äôs not their job . But you don‚Äôt see many other uniformed jobs wear offensive symbolism
Haha
Yes, it is just Montreal making an issue of this ‚Äòsimple‚Äô symbol.  You know it has been banned by cities across N.A. and the RCMP right?  
If brotherly solidarity was so important to them, the police could start by treating their fellow man with humanity regardless of their race.  
I won‚Äôt have any sympathy for a group that regularly show examples of racism, unchecked violence, and impunity across the ranks.  And even IF this is from a minority of police, the blind support amongst the ranks shows the core is rotten
lol it‚Äôs a hate symbol. Straight up. Now shut the fuck up.
>  Leave it to Montreal to overanalyze a simple symbol
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_blue_line
> most people slinging mud at them night and day wouldn't last a night or a day in their shoes.
Found the cop. 
You know it's fine to just do a job without begging people to call you a hero, right? In fact, actual "heroes" tend to not whine so much generally.
> Funny most people slinging mud at them night and day wouldn't last a night or a day in their shoes.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, wasting 2 hours of tax payers money by chilling next to tim hortons and you say people wouldn't last ?
You have almost 70% more chances of dying working as a pizza delivery than being a cop.
√áa fait longtemps que le red scare c'est d√©pass√©. Va falloir que tu trouve autre chose que de traiter le monde de communistes.
Yeah, the 136 people who downvoted you are all Commies. Must be it.
That‚Äôs how I feel too. I wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable if a guy with a patch like that pulled me over.
Probably terrified as the cop leads them to the all-minority cop-centration camps on the outskirts of Oppressionville! It's a miracle there are any minorities left at this point!
Seems pretty much exactly what these ding dongs want: no oversight for them to go on their rampages with extreme prejudice.
Very cordial and professional. Nothing negative to say. They accompany patients who have been victim/perpetrator of a crime or people that have been in big motor v√©hicule accident for a while depending on the situation.
I didn‚Äôt say it excuses them at all. In fact, I explicitly stated it is not a mitigating factor.
... I have no idea what you‚Äôre point is.
We could delve into the deeper points of Gnosticism but that seems like a pointless exercise.
You largely overestimate the challenge that legal practice and teaching represent...
As for soldiers and doctors, they're not generally the ones criticizing cops, so yeah. Moot point.
You mean the same RCMP whose bosses are the liberals? 
Lmao, as if that was any sort of reference for anything.
That's cool buddy. You can crawl back to your safe space.
I'm not even a cop dude.
Better luck next time.
You got a source on that ‚Äústatistic‚Äù, chief?
On the r/Montreal subreddit? Yes lol
I wish you would actually interact with what I said rather than your imagined tangent version. The city did an [investigation of the police force and found that they were 4-5 times more likely to stop a racial minority than they are a white person.](https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/racial-profiling-systemic-biases-within-montreal-police-force-report-says) Does this mean that they every interaction between police and a person of colour results in the cop assaulting or killing that person? No, but it is tangible proof that there is a racial bias in the city's police force.
Now if you are someone who is far more likely to be stopped by cops just because of the colour of your skin, how can you be trusting and at ease if that officer is wearing an out-of-uniform skull patch? Which again is the symbolic representation of death. It feels especially ironic in the age Bill 21 where there is a debate over public servants (like police officers) being able to wear religious garb & symbols, and then having some cops thinking its okay to wear uniform defying death-related iconography. At the very least, it is an absolutely tone deaf move on the part of any cop who chooses to wear a Punisher skull.
I‚Äôm agreeing with you dude
[deleted]
You have no idea? Really? You must PROBABLY know what my point is in the same way you PROBABLY know why cops in Montreal have started wearing this symbol.
You definitely underestimate the challenge teaching represents. And that tells us all we need to know about your opinions.
ew people are still saying this? are you not embarrassed
> I'm not even a cop dude.
I mean, it was a joke, but congrats on just licking someone's boot, rather than actually owning the boot?

Delivery drivers is ranked well above police officers. The source at BLS.gov is down right now.
Construction workers and people in transport have a higher mortality rate than cops
And most cops die because someone hit them during a traffic stop.
Did they do an investigation of how much more likely a racial minority is to commit a crime than a White person? Is there a racial bias in statistical modeling?? We must deconstruct math!
Gnosticism deals with knowledge, as in knowing the real truth. Unfortunately any real truth that any human can claim to know is ultimately reduced down to a expression of faith; A deeply held belief that cant be ultimately prooved.
In this case you have one side saying the thin blue line represents a form of latent facism or hidden far right beliefs, another side says it represents a solidarity for people that share the experience of a dangerous and traumatic employment.
It is possible that it is one or the other or both simultaneously depending on the personal beliefs of the persons wearing the badge and the person looking at the person wearing the badge.
Bet you're an undercover cop lmao.
No, I really don‚Äôt. 
I‚Äôm arguing against the cops here because I know people who are police and know what their train of thought is, and you‚Äôre just trying to argue about how I can know anything. Well I could just argue back that how can you claim to know something.  Like, what‚Äôs the point of that circular argument?
I can‚Äôt even tell why you would argue about ‚Äúknowing‚Äù anything. You could apply that to literally anything in an attempt to shut down discussion about anything. 
So no, I have no fucking idea why you‚Äôre arguing a minute point. I‚Äôm not claiming to speak FOR any police, I‚Äôm saying from the people that I DO know, I can see their perspective on it, but that it‚Äôs still WRONG. I didn‚Äôt claim to have absolute clairvoyance on every cop and know everything, just what I do know.
I bet you think you sound clever...
Nothing beats going to the biodome in the dead of winter to hang out in the tropical zone. I‚Äôve missed going the past few years. 
Doesn‚Äôt look like they changed that much during the renos from what I‚Äôve seen though.
Is that after the supposedly giant renovation that tooks years? It look very similar to how it did before...
Finally going there this weekend, dates become available on a day by day basis one month ahead
I just went there yesterday. Everything is amazing! The animals are super cute.
Always look like the V√©lodrome to me...
Too bad it is insanely difficult to get tickets.
Le d√¥me des pingouins fait vraiment pitier....
Holy adverts!
viva los biodome
I miss so much the Biod√¥ne
Fucking penguin shit smell... Ugh
still a fucking zoo...
Went there with my kids 2 kids last September I was very disappointed knowing all the money we spent there with our taxes ....it's very small and there's nothing much...
The south pole is not a ecosystem of the Americas.
That's what I heard also. Nothing much changed, visually. I gather lots of back-end stuff though. Infrastructure etc.
Haven‚Äôt been there in forever, so for me it will feel like new!
It was the "behind the scene" that was in bad shape.
Looks like 90% or more of the video is pre covid, so before the renovations
Je suis all√© la semaine derni√®re et honn√™tement, on dirait qu‚Äôils ont juste nettoy√© les lieux et enlev√© des animaux/plantes en trop.
Yeah looks the same lol
Yup, it's nuts. Had a week worth of slots fill up as I added one day to my cart. Slot was available one minute, then no slots a minute later!
Finally got a spot but man it's popular right now!
If you sign up for the yearly pass, you have a separate ticket booth with more availability, otherwise it's made available on a day-per-day basis one month ahead at midnight.
So tonight, you'll be able to get tickets for May 23rd for example.
All I could see was imprisoned animals... How is this still legal?
You being downvotes but you are right, there really isn't much there anymore. All the money and years of closure for what exactly lol.
Who cares lmao i still want to see the penguins
They aren‚Äôt Antarctic penguins‚Äî you can find all of the penguins at the Biodome at the southernmost tip of South America and in the Antarctic circle islands, but largely not Antarctica itself.
preach üôå
Its honestly disappointing, a lot of animals missing and all they added really was some stairs in some areas and that bland af huge entry.
Honestly not worth going.
The ice tunnel is new so it‚Äôs post renovations I think.
This is post renos, you can tell by the gigantic artsy white walls.
Oh c‚Äôest dommages d‚Äôentendre √ßa, je m‚Äôattendais √† quelque chose de tout nouveau...
There are more availibility if someone signs up for the yearly pass btw, Amis du Biodome?
It‚Äôs not imprisonment, but a conservation effort. Species at the Biod√¥me are given what they need for the environment to feel like their natural habitat, and a lot of those species are part of international conservation efforts, where we have no choice but to breed animals in captivity, because their numbers are too low. The golden lion tamarin of the tropical habitat, for example, is a species that has become endangered because of the destruction of its habitat in Brazil, and there is so few individuals that‚Äôs it‚Äôs unlikely that the  remaining ones would be able to meet and reproduce enough for the species to survive. Ideally, we would eventually be able to reintroduce the species in the wild.
People see it as a conservation and educational tool to ensure the long term survival of these animals and their ecosystems. Most people working there love animals and have spent a large part of their lives caring for them, they often seem to care more about the animals than the people, which is a good thing :)
lmao you probably would have said the same about the whale enclosure they were trying to add.
They have lots of penguins in Africa also.  Cute little ones.
They say sub antarctic zone...
I think its mixed
How come no one has masks?
Why are you so convinced that biodiversity conservation is the reason why these animals are there in the first place? Rather than simple entertainment? They don't even mention it on their website. All places with animals in captivity claim that they do that for biodiversity/ raising awareness while making money on their backs for beings cute. They don't even provide information on which animals are there and how endangered their species are.
>They don't even mention it on their website
This literally took me three clicks to find on their website:
*Within the framework of a policy of compliance with international plant and animal health standards, the Biod√¥me‚Äôs conservation activities involve its living collections as well as safeguarding natural environments. The Biod√¥me participates in a number of national and international conservation programs to prevent extinction and promote reintroduction of endangered species into their natural habitat. It also conducts many research projects on endangered species or collaborates with partner institutions on their research.*
(Source: [https://espacepourlavie.ca/en/conservation-projects-0](https://espacepourlavie.ca/en/conservation-projects-0))
Beavers are not endangered
No, but they once were because of over hunting for their fur. They have since been reintroduced into the wild, which has been going pretty well. And beavers are what we call a ‚Äúkeystone species‚Äù. Which means they have a lot of impact on the ecosystem around them, and their disappearance would most likely mean very drastic consequences for that ecosystem, consequences that could also impact us humans. So it‚Äôs a good thing they have been reintroduced. However, that reintroduction also came with problems in certain areas, so there is research being done at the Biod√¥me with the goal of finding a way to limit their population in those problematic areas without interfering with their mating behaviour.
La d√©sinformation sur le COVID est interdite.
Si vous √™tes un compte qui viens sur /r/montreal pratiquement jamais sinon pour parler de COVID, je ne sait pas elle vient d'ou cette brigade, mais je vais vous calisser dehors de fa√ßon permanente.
Y'en a eu ~~deux~~ trois bannis √† date juste dans le thread.
Lost my job last December right before the holidays. Convinced I won‚Äôt be able to find anything now. There‚Äôs nothing to look forward to these days.. 
Not saying the lockdown is not necessary, I just wish people took it more seriously and stopped gathering, travelling to Mexico, and just respected the rules. Your selfishness affects others
This is an interesting exercise where the government is trying to mandate individual behaviour through recommendations, guidelines and restrictions and they are discovering that they are powerless in the face of fucking morons that refuse to follow their recommendations, guidelines and restrictions.
There is no social contract.  Not enough people care what this virus does to less vulnerable people to change their behaviours.
So here we are, losing our freedoms to spread viruses and make people sick and we are furious about it.
This is a test run.  Humanity has Zero chance against a more deadly virus.
We hear so much about the death rate, i wish we heard more about the lasting health effects for people that are catchibg COVID. I am not in an age group that i would likely die if it caught this, but i am going to do everything i can to avoid catching something that could cause me health problems for the rest of my life.
Not dying is important to me for sure, but so is being able to climb the stairs without being out of breath, or keeping all of my limbs...
Honestly, this next lockdown just confirms that I need to stock up on some Lindt sea salt chocolate bars, plunk my ass on my couch for the 9th month in a row and watch repeats of shitty movies until I die.
[removed]
Just go all out. Close fucking schools, have some measures in to compensate parents who gotta stay home with their kids, just all out full lockdown till there's some control. I hate this half assed measures for a few weeks till it dips, reopen, numbers rise ,rinse repeat.
ciboire que j‚Äôsuis √©coeur√© de cet osti d‚Äôaffaire-l√†. en plus avec Lego qui nous parle comme si on avait 5 ans, sacrament man soit clair et assume ce que tu dis, √ßa r√®glerait la moiti√© des probl√®mes
A ce que je sache on est en confinement depuis octobre, et il y avait d√©j√† confinement total du 25 d√©cembre au 11 janvier. Maintenant ils parlent comme si on n'a fait que chiller en gang les 3 derniers mois. J'ai pas vu mes amis depuis 3 mois pour qu'on me dise que je suis un des seuls connards qui a pris √ßa au s√©rieux.
Awaye tout le monde a maison mais on va garder les √©coles primaires ouvertes histoire d'annuler le reste des mesures prises
I don't know why, but the idea of "curfew" just feels different. Like it's more upsetting than the other measures.
And when this doesn't work (like everything else done until now, other than when the weather got warmer and people were actually scared) what will they do? There's literally nothing left to close, and people care less than at any other time to date.
Comme je le disais dans l'autre post qui a √©t√© supprim√©,
Bon...faque je vais finir mon t√©l√©-travail √† 18h (comme probablement bien des gens) et je vais avoir peut-√™tre juste 2h pour cuisiner, manger et essayer d'aller prendre l'air convenablement avant de m'enfermer √† nouveau en dedans... Pas stressant du tout! √áa, c'est si j'ai pas de besoin de courrir √† l'√©picerie pour me foutre avec le paquet d'autre monde qui vont avoir le m√™me horaire que le mien et qui vont se ruer toute √† la m√™me place en m√™me temps.
J'esp√®re que √ßa fait partie des exceptions que Legault pr√©voit, parce que concentrer tout le monde √† l'√©picerie en m√™me temps, c'est pas id√©al.
Well then, looks like he has completely lost control now. 
Seems every single facet of the population hates him for how he has handled the pandemic.
Les gens critiquent rapidement le gouvernement pour des mesures trop s√©v√®res/laxes alors que c'est pas le gouvernement qui se prom√®ne, va voir les familles, les amis de milliers de personnes chaque jour pour les contaminer. C'est pas le gouvernement qui va voir des dizaines de personnes par jour et leur dit, c'est fini pour toi mon/ma Claude/Claudette. C'est la population. Peu importe les r√®gles en places et les amendes, si les gens r√©alisent pas qu'ils agissent comme des maudits maillets, √ßa finira jamais. C'est notre responsabilit√© √† nous de nous contr√¥ler et finir tout √ßa... 
Il y a certains endroits o√π le gouvernement joue un plus grand r√¥le (ex, CHSLD). Par contre, le virus se t√©l√©porte pas dans le CHSLD, il cible pas les travailleurs de la sant√©. Des gens sont n√©gligents, contaminent les autres et √ßa rentre dans les institutions de sant√©. Est-ce que plus pourrait √™tre fait pour prot√©ger nos a√Æn√©s? D√©finitivement. Est-ce que c'est un probl√®me qui va se r√©gler en un claquement de doigt? Aucune chance. En attendant, si tout le monde de responsabilisait le virus aurait moins de chance de rentrer...
A curfew is absolutely unecessary and stupid.
Just a reminder that we were at 100 cases per day for the entire PROVINCE last summer
100 a day. Not 2500. With BARS, GYMS, STORES all opened.
Close the schools, compensate the parents and leave everything else open
To the people who still think this is a result of a few bad apples or "idiots", you need to stop. We've be in a more and more fierce lockdown since October, and the numbers have only ramped up. Looking at Quebec's stats, 30% of current cases are from the schools, and 60% are from work environments. There was a very small percentage from stores, gyms, restaurants, etc. So why are these things closed? We should be questioning a better way, rather than keep doubling down on something that isn't working. The rigid lockdown will cause people to lie and cheat, and meet inside a non-ventilated home with no windows open because it's winter. I know you don't like it, and would rather blame, but we need to produce solutions that account for these. Lockdowns and mass fines/curfews are just not realistic, and horrible for our long term. When everything opens up and 90% of businesses are closed due to 0 income for months, or taxes hike up to make up for all the money our government has sent out, it will be a new type of hell. Not a virus, but a new problem that won't be as fun. 
Lockdown's aren't working, we need to come up with a better solution and stop blaming people. It doesn't help anyone.
Anyone else noticed that as the quebec cases were rising like crazy, the only thing in the news for a few days was about "you get paid 1000$ for coming back from vacation" , it was a great distraction
Bruh je pensais que c‚Äôest √ßa qu‚Äôils essayaient de faire d√©j√† mdr
Est-ce que ca value d'ouvrir les √©coles pour toutes les cons√©quences qu'on subit aujourd'hui ? Ou est-ce qu'on veut continuer d'√™tre en d√©ni et dire que les √©coles ce n'√©tait pas un vecteur...tout comme au d√©but de la pand√©mie quand le gouvernement nous a conseiller de ne pas porter de masque.

As someone who has tuned out of virus news in Montreal (I just stay home, wear a mask and don‚Äôt bother anyone so I‚Äôm doing my part), can anyone tell me if we know the reason why cases keep climbing even with all the measures in place ?
-Why did the lockdown work the first time and not this time?
-Which age group is most affected ?
-In which scenarios are people getting infected the most ? Who‚Äôs responsible ?
Thanks !
Many financial institutions and insurance companies are currently hiring customer service agents to work from home. The starting salary is 20$/hr and up. A friend was recently hired by Industrial Alliance and they are flexible in terms of schedule with her classes. All you need is bilingualism and an internet connection. Hope that helps for some of you students and single parents out there!
Do you people think this includes internet installation?
I moved apartments on the first of this month, and my internet won't be installed until the 13th.Right now, I drive 30 minutes to work remote at my old apartment. My old roommates understand my situation, thankfully.
Anyways, if internet installation isn't considered essential I'll probably go tent up in a park or something
Does the provincial government plan to offer people financial help during this new lockdown and curfew? My partner works at an essential store but mostly at night, meaning her hours will be severely cut due to the curfew...  is there a benefit she can claim for the lost income?
I don't understand the purpose of a curfew. The virus doesn't spread any more easily at night.
Well, I mean ,I guess we will be out of this by spring ,right?!? Anyhow the sole option I can think of is to move to another province and start a new life at this point if that is in your best interest in terms of certain job sectors, more housing options, and more space.
I have a stupid, selfish question - if I want to get a Tims at 10pm, I can't go, right? 
otherwise, this changes literally nothing about my life over the past 9 months.
What I really HATE is that there were tons of parents that didn't want their kids to go back to school and wanted distance learning,  but were told that they didn't qualify and HAD to send their kids to school.   If the schools were at 50% occupation or whatever with 50% staying home \*voluntarily\* then maybe we wouldn't be in this mess.   Some families had a parent willing and able to help with schoolwork.   Now if they keep ALL children home,  there are a lot of families who aren't able to help with schoolwork for whatever reason,  so it's all just a mess.   You FORCED us to send our kids into these schools when we didn't want to,  and now it's our fault?
So if I read this correctly, 1300 people in a province of 8 million are currently in the hospital because of Covid, and somehow the health care system is out of control? They‚Äôve had 8 months to prepare for this wave and can‚Äôt handle hospitalizations in the low thousands? I want to be clear that I am not trying to discredit or belittle those who are suffering (nor the HC workers), but I don‚Äôt see how the system can‚Äôt handle it? A breaking point in the low thousands seems ... low. Many flaws in our HC system. But politicians prefer that we blame each other and pretend that everyone is gathering and having parties and orgies
Si je me fie √† sa premi√®re tentative, il va toffer 2 semaines avant de nous revenir avec une 2√®me relance ~~√©conomique~~ √©pid√©mique. Le temps de clairer assez d'emplois dans l'√©conomie et rabaisser une deuxi√®me fois les standards de travail dans un march√© d√©sormais noy√© de nouveaux ch√¥meurs. √áa va bien aller üåà
Curfews? People acting like children? 
Is this 1942?
So we've finally arrived at the point we should have been at since September. Would this have been seen as more an overreaction back then compared to now?
√áa c'est de la faute des anti-masques pis des n√©gationnistes du COVID. Rien qu'une gang de criminels.
Apr√©s le lockdown un maison fera l'autre +20% comme cet √©t√©, donc 500k (400k en 2019) ira √° 600k. On devra augmenter encore notre limite d'hypotheque et reduire les ans du retraite m√™me plus. =(
Quoi qu'il arrive, je crois que je continue a travailler. La compagnie (manufacture) pour laquelle je travaille a obtenu exemption lors du dernier confinement et je crois qu'elle l'obtiendra pour celui-ci aussi
Toilet paper panic buying has already begun... This kind of crap makes me genuinely embarrassed for society.
Uh oh.
Depuis le d√©but de la pand√©mie, moi et ma famille on suit les mesures de sant√©, tout ce qui peut r√©duire la transmission. Le printemps a √©t√© tough. Enferm√©, avec 3 enfants qui foutent la merde, √† tenter de travailler en m√™me temps. On s'accroche, parce que √ßa fait du sens de r√©duire les contacts, de mettre des masques, d'√©viter de se promener pour rien. Pendant ce temps, l'autre moiti√© du couple joue l'ange guardien, √† risquer de se faire infecter, passer dans la sas de d√©cotamination de la maison apr√®s √™tre rentr√©e de ses visites √† domicile chez des personnes vuln√©rables. On est pr√™t √† le refaire, se lever √† 6h le matin, rentrer du t√©l√©travaille de 6h √† 7h, avant de g√©rer les enfants toutes la journ√©e, travailler de 15h√†20h pour finir mes heures de job pendant le chaos du souper.
Pis √† 20h, je sors dehors prendre l'air.
C'est le seul chose qui permet de pas craquer.
Faque fuck ton couvre-feu Legault.
To everyone frustrated and saying "but my liberty", suck it up. Our hospitals are overwhelmed and reaching capacity, and frankly that's all that matters as death will explode once we reach that critical point.
Ca fait crissement chier mais faut ce qu‚Äôil faut i guess.

I really hope you find something, there's always something to look forward to. 
Me and my good friend lost our jobs back in march (bartending) and after a couple of months we found better jobs for which we went to school for. The first few months are the hardest but luckily we have a pretty great social net at the moment (CRB & bonified-unemployment).
Best of luck
Im hiring for warehouse if you‚Äôre interested
Hospitals are always hiring assistants! I know it might not be in you field of interest but some hospital jobs don't require patient proximity and pay well!
Don't loose faith man, I graduated in June and found something last month, it's a temporary contract but it will tide me over until summer. It can be done! Keep in mind delays for job applications affect businesses too - to give you an idea, I heard back today from a job I applied to in October..
if we did 3 weeks of total lockdown back in march we would have gone back to normal a long time ago, but no people had to do unnecessary things outside because they were ''bored''
La fruiterie Premier Choix n'existe malheureusement plus. Le commerce a d√©m√©nag√© au coin de Beaubien et Papineau  il y a quelques ann√©es (suite √† une augmentation de loyer) et est maintenant ferm√© (probablement suite √† la mort du patriarche (c'√©tait une entreprise familiale).

Looks better than real life.
Great skill. I like the brownstone you painted. Reminded me of the one I live in on Ste-Famille

Just watched a video about housing in Vienna and how they managed to remain so affordable. This seems to be inspired from that and could potentially be an actual solution for affordable housing assuming they do it right.
Y as-tu des √©rections qui s'en viennent?
(vouas avez lu *√©lection*, hen? Mouhaha!)
Voici comment ca va se passer:
1-Le secteur de la construction √©tant d√©ja 100% occup√©, on fait juste d√©placer de project les travailleurs qui construiront ces logements. Au final il n'y aura pas plus de logement de construits dans 5 ans que si la Ville ne fait rien.
2-Les occupants de ces logements deviennent une classe privil√©gi√©e. Ceux qui ne font pas partie de cette classe (surtout les g√©n√©rations a venir) eux, devront se battre pour un nombre r√©duit de logement, compar√© a si ce privil√®ge n'existait pas. Ils vont payer plus cher en cons√©quence parce que pour eux, la p√©nurie sera pire
3-Les occupants privil√©gi√©s vont tout faire pour garder ce privil√®ge, quitte a rester seuls dans un logement devenus trop grand une fois les enfants partis, ou rester dans un logement tr√®s loin de leur nouveau lieu de travail, ce qui ne lib√®re pas le logement pour une famille a laquelle il serait plus adapt√©. On appelle ca r√©duire la mobilit√© de la population.
Au final la ville d√©pense des milliards pour empirer la situation en cr√©ant une classe privil√©gie au d√©pend de la majorit√©. Le controle des prix, ca rend toujours les choses pires.
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
edit: J'oubliais, 4: les milliards d√©pens√©s par la ville vont contribuer a la surchauffe du prix des terrains.
If this article is anything to go by affordable housing has been abused in the past - https://www.townoflaronge.ca/real-estate-affordable-condos-for-doctors-and-investors/
Je viens d'entendre Ferrandez sur le sujet √† SRC et il dit que Sanders a cr√©√© un million de logements au Vermont.
Hein?
Y'ont m√™me pas 700 000 habitants dans l'√©tat.
C'est tellement de la bullshit politique. 800 million sur 40 ans pour acheter des terrains c'est rien. $20M par ann√©e pour que de la terres et encore la il faut des terrains √† vendre.
Des promesses politiques sans fin avec aucun cadre ou plate-forme cr√©dible. Esti que c'est de la merde les √©lections municipaux.
Comment on se met en liste pour en avoir? Pas faire comme l'autre fois que c'est juste les chummy du developer qui y on eu acc√®s....
Relax the fucking zoning already. There is not much that 60,000 can do.
Since this is the government, it will have cost overrun and it will be delayed for a few years.
Que veut dire "abordable"?
So, another promise she has no intention of fulfilling.
Lol, il y a loin de la coupe au l√®vres :/
Ah ben, justement en plein d√©but d'√©lection municipal. Quel hazard!

Ce n'est pas d'hier que le probl√®me des loyers est connu.
Heard it all before a dozen times. Never really seems to get done. Dislike her for her bicycle mania and Coderre for his skyscraper fetish.
Ca sent le mensonge‚Ä¶ eu! Je veux dire la promesse d‚Äô√©lection typique‚Ä¶
Maaaan, Coderre needs to just shut the fuck up already. What a prick.

Je suis pas 100% contre ce que tu dis mais y'a quand m√™me des d√©tails important :
-	Tu assumes que 100% de la constructions va en ce moment √† des nouveaux logements, ce qui est faux
-	J'ose assumer que les logements abordables vont aussi √™tre plus dense que la construction moyenne. Prendre un entrepreneur qui travail sur transformer un duplex en maison unifamiliale et le mettre sur ce projet la c'est un b√©n√©fice.
T'as oublie comment les logements vont etre attribue aux familles des contracteurs pour toucher la rente bien comme il faut.
Concernant le point que les gens restent tout seuls dans un petit logement ca peut tres facilement se r√©gler par l'introduction d'un r√®glement. Ils le font deja pour les HLM alors pourquoi pas les logements abordables?

Ben non, voyons donc.

Exact, rendu l√† elle aurait d√ª juste en promettre 100 000 sa aura fait aucune diff√©rence
Mon p√®re √©tait sur la liste des HLM pendant plus de 15 ans...il est d√©c√©d√© alors qu'il restait une dizaine de personnes devant lui.
Pendant des ann√©es le GVT le niaisait, le faisant passer de 50ieme sur la liste a 500ieme...au gr√© des politiciens.
hey hey, les enfants aussi!
Que les chums du contracteur, des medecins, des avocats etc vont les acheter pas chere pour les louer ou revendre a un prix de fou. Comme la derniere fois.
C'est pas une promesse, elle viens d'annoncer que √ßa se fait.

The country is irrelevant. In the last 10 years the population of Vienna has increased around [1.18% per year](https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/vienna-population), compared to [0.80% per year](https://www.macrotrends.net/cities/20384/montreal/population) of Montreal. Both have slowed down during the pandemic.
Bruh this is a braindead argument. Why are you looking up data for Austria and not Vienna? That's borderline just dishonesty.
And? That means there is less money to be made and still managed to have decent public housing.
Nous autres aussi on a une croissance d√©mographique n√©gative, techniquement. On fait beaucoup moins d'enfants et la g√©n√©ration de nos grand-parents sont pas mal tous en train de mourir.
Le pays se fie √† l'immigration pour essayer de conserver la croissance.

En fait construire en hauteur c'est plus long en homme/hr et plus cher par logement. Ya rien de moins cher et plus rapide qu'un champ de bungalow.
Plus tu introduis de r√©glements et plus tu ouvres la porte a la fraude et l'abus. Et on fait quoi avec les logements condos. On force la personne a vendre?
Ahhh ca me fait penser. Donner des logements condos "abordables" a des gens qui suppos√©ment n'ont pas beaucoup d'argent pour l'entretient, ET a qui on emp√™che toute possibilit√© de faire un profit a la revente, c'est la recette parfaite pour que ces appartments tournent en taudis d'ici 10 ans.

Je ne sais pas si √ßa se fait.
I was at game 4. I took the exit we were directed to. We exited onto a street blocked by riot police at both ends, and we were tear gassed basically seconds later. Ducked into a doorway and put on our sunglasses and threw our game towels over our faces. Then a crowd started moving through a narrow exit left by the cops. We followed and were tear gassed again.
I didn‚Äôt see anyone throwing bottles or rioting, but then I didn‚Äôt have time before being tear gassed twice with no warning.
For what it‚Äôs worth my friend and I are women in our 50s and basically would have been actively trying to get away from anything that looked violent or even overly enthusiastic - I have no desire to be around fireworks on a crowded city street and we‚Äôre a bit old to be flipping police cars. We had no chance at all to even see what was going on before being gassed. I guess the message is that if you go to a hockey game you should expect to be gassed walking out the door?
If I got gassed for nothing, it would motivate me to smash something 
SPVM are racist idiots.  Fuck them
Fuck the SPVM, too lazy to do their job in any way, shape or form. If you need them, they do nothing. If there‚Äôs no reason for them to be there, they‚Äôll steamroll you. Defund the whole lot of em.
[deleted]
Fuck the SPVM, seriously.
It was ridiculous... cops let, what, 20,000 people stand around shoulder to shoulder for two hours with no masks, and literally the minute the game is over, shoot tear gas into the crowd while people are starting to walk away...
Anyone see the little bursts of them making a wall with their riot gear and running down the street? Apparently people weren't walking fast enough...
Dicks.
Montreal police are some of the worst people I have ever met. Horrible human beings. Napoleon complex to the max. They need to be disbanded.
I personally think that all hockey fans should be tear gassed at all times. Hanging out with the buds? Tear gassed. Out at a restaurant? Tear gassed. It‚Äôs the only way to be sure.
Welp, I'm not going to/near a game any time soon. Fuck spending money to get my ass kicked by a zealot. I'm not into that shit. I'll spend my money elsewhere.

"We also really really wanted to"
fuck them, they were just itching to shoot into a crowd
Cops being cops as allways.
I honestly feel like they were frustrated they haven't been able to flex their muscles for a while with everyone locked inside. 
I saw how they behaved when they started policing the parks, it was an insane overreach. Rude, violent, destructive. It's like they wanted to remind a city full of people who haven't left their homes in a year who's in charge.
ACAB
The issue of police brutality needs to be reframed to reflect what it actually is: Cowardice. Are police officers so terrified of a small subset of rowdy fans that they need to indiscriminately gas an entire crowd? If that's your mindset, you're not brave enough, tough enough, or mentally fit enough to police this city.
How can we complain effectively about this?
I get it, they‚Äôve got a reputation to uphold
That‚Äôs some Minority Report plot right there. Gaz them BEFORE they do the crime.
[Gas lacrymog√®ne qui sort subitement du plafond du club] "3h, on ferme!"
SPVM the embodiment of failure 
Maybe they need to only hire cops above 6' like they used to...
I was there every game. They end up saying people throw bottles and fight police. People are just there to watch the game. Police decides to act though and tear gas for no reason is what turns a hockey game into a riot. They act like people watching a hockey game are there to riot and break everything.
I saw no one throw a single bottle or projectile at the cops. I was in the middle of the crowd to see the action and the police were the ones creating trouble. Surprisingly, game 6 they did not tear gas or act though.. what happened?? People just calmly walked away.
They got annoying with their bikes and didn't let people walk in alleys around the bell center (i guess you lose your right to walk freely in downtown after a hockey game??) but other than that it was super peaceful.
I am sure there are still good people in the SPVM but it's sad some of them act so violently and disrespectfully to the public since covid. These guys go home and tell their wives "today at work i tear gassed a crowd full of families and hockey fans " 
The situation is unreal..
Zero video footage?!
"We wanted Tampa to win."
I love how theres not even a video and people are already throwing around words like "facist". Jesus christ how do you expect cops to respond to a riot? I really wanna hear one of you "woke" dumb fucks tell me how to disperse a crowd of people who are causing mayham. 
Yes of course there are bystanders but these games get fucking insane like this all the time! Stop going ape shit over sports and maybe cops wont show up idiots.
[deleted]
Warning shots ü§£
Montreal will riot whether the Canadians win or lose. It's rare that I find myself on the cop's side, but I'm for gassing them all as soon as the game is over. Ok, that's maybe a bit harsh. Give the families 20 minutes to disperse, then gas the assholes that are causing chaos. 
TBH, I'm also in favor of gassing people that drive around honking their horn after "their" team wins.
Good for them, if the fans can't celebrate in a reasonable fashion without breaking shit, assaulting, arson etc. the police has every right. It's what they're paid to do
> we‚Äôre a bit old to be flipping police cars. 
Don't sell yourself short, you're never to old to resist police brutality.
Same thing happened to us game 6 against Vegas. Left the building as directed by staff and I guess police as we were held inside the building well a "police action" was ongoing outside. 
Immediately tear gassed, people were rushed by baton waving police, I was cross checked and hit, people with young children and families were being corralled as well. 
Of course all the police hide their badge numbers or any identifiers. 
Crazy that if this was done in a war zone against soldiers, deploying tear gas would be a war crime. But against Montrealer's just trying to get home after a hockey game its completely legal.
Your story needs to be told to a larger audience so politicians take notice.
Unfortunately, until the population starts to really speak out forcefully, the politicians are also powerless to make changes in this heavy and well protected institution.
[deleted]
Seriously, if the response is the same, why not destroy some police property.
They really are a special bunch, I've hated them ever since I got stopped for jaywalking at 10pm and got accused of assaulting my girlfriend. Like what the fuck lmao.
People were throwing fireworks, jumping on police cars etc, what did you want them to do, ask them to go home nicely ? It was already out of control.
Walked by the crowd for game 5 and they're all suiting up with plated gloves and full body armor. This is how they prepare for a hockey crowd, literally a gang funded by tax payers.
As much as I don't like the rhetoric around defund movements, my house got robbed and they literally did fuck all. Fucking reform, defund and reallocate that money to something that works.
This is police anywhere in Canada.
Is there anything us citizens can do to push for reform? Call a delegate or something? The police here drive me mad. I see them constantly doing stupid shit like tear gassing citizens, harassing people in parks, and generally being assholes. They need a restructuring, badly.
> We train them to be
There is the root of the issue.
The training programs for our municipal police forces are not only antiquated they are of very low quality.
If the training doesn't change, it'll be nearly impossible to get a better police force even if you address all the other issues.
I know you need very good grade/R-score (went to Cegep Ahunstic and John Abott Open house) to get into a program Police Techniques in Quebec college. Lmk if I'm wrong. 
Idk if I should relate because, smart college students are good cops? Old police generation are bad? Or is just cops being cops? New cops being brainwashed? Or is the media portrays police as the good or bad? 
I used to want to become a cop, but not anymore. I feared being killed and being targeted if I become one. I've seen some when I worked as a security guard in downtown. I hated being there. Although is in small scale, but it gives me a general idea to be a cop (have to intervene, follow procedure). I'm glad I didn't get into police technique.
Idk man, I'm still puzzled to this.
It's the whole pre-crime thing, without any precogs.
I feel like large city police forces are a mistake, the larger the force the more layers of dehumanization between them and the populace. We need small community forces, manned by local people to each district. Somebody who may very well be policing their neighbor. That way there would be social accountability like an oldschool small town cop.
There could be protocols where neighboring districts provide support if there's a large disruption that requires more than the small local force can handle, but day to day, it's neighbor policing neighbor.
Drive too slow? Believe it or not, tear gas.
Also, hockey fans who haven't done anything wrong now will surely do something wrong in 2023 or 2030 (they're hockey fans, right). So you're 'early bird' punishing them innocent now in advance and in bulk, potentially saving tax payers' money in the future.
Good idea. I stopped supporting these millionaires years ago. Same with all sports. I stopped spending any money whatsoever.
Yeah the Habs organization should of said something if they actually cared about their fans. No fucking way I will ever go to the Bell Centre. Your fucking police officers are fucking mental.
You can always file a complaint to the police about the police. Hey, wait a minute! That sounds wrong! 
Seriously though, I'd use the political route, try to talk to a local representative. Apparently Mr. Marvin Rotrand is the man to talk to.
Maybe you should be spending a little less time on the internet and more time outside in the real world.
So‚Ä¶ you complain about how there should be video before people react, then assume there‚Äôs ‚Äúmayhem‚Äù without evidence.
Seems like you‚Äôre just cheering for your team.
There wasn‚Äôt anyone causing mayhem that I saw. The only people I saw being violent were the riot police who trapped us and then shot us with tear gas immediately after the game without even letting people leave, let alone asking us to.
Presque toute la rue Pie-IX est en travaux depuis environ deux ans. Une raison pourquoi la carte ne le refl√®te pas?
Arriv√©s?
Est-ce qu'ils √©taient partis? J'ai pas remarqu√©
J'ai prit la map sur le site [info-travaux](http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=7097,79001583&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL) de la ville de Montr√©al.
TIL qu‚Äôon a un quartier qui s‚Äôappelle Sault-Au-R√©collet √† l‚Äôest de Ahuntsic. Parfois j‚Äôai l‚Äôimpression que Google Maps invente des affaires.
Et le gars de la ville sont comme des magiciens. Je passe par une rue le dimanche soir et il n'y a aucun signe de travaux puis le lendemain matin la rue est compl√®tement ferm√©e avec les c√¥nes oranges et toute la machinerie qui va avec.
Contremaitre de travaux publics ici: pas de travaux, pas de r√©parations= d√©t√©rioration des infrastructures. Captain Obvious, I know.   
Bye
c'est bien.
Faut bien les faire ces travaux, et c'est pas en plein hiver que √ßa va se faire.  
Sur le Plateau , ils sont suppos√© refaire des bouts de trottoirs sur St-Laurent, je vais le croire quand je vais le voir.
Si je ne m'abuse, sur Villeray c'est juste refaire les marquages pour refaire la double piste cyclable de l'√©t√© dernier.
Si je me prom√®ne, je croise plus de travaux actuellement en cours que ce qu'il est sur la carte (ou le site Info-travaux), c'est donc tristement incomplet, pas √† jour, ou les travaux fait par les arrondissements sont pas indiqu√©s ici.
They really outta start making roads out of concrete. Doesn't disintegrate as fast and easier to repair.
Pour le moment c'est pas si pire mais j'imagine que √ßa sera pas long avant d'en voir plus.
Le pont de la concorde √ßa va faire deux ans que y'a des travaux dessus. Le bitume est d√©j√† magan√©, la piste cyclable remplie de trous. Ils laisseraient √ßa de meme que √ßa serait moins abim√© j'ai l'impression.
Oh wow! They're finally gonna fix that bombed-out stretch of St Joseph?! No waaaay

D‚Äôailleurs c‚Äôest quand que √ßa finit cette construction ??

Merci Google Maps.
Yes! Elle √©tait tellement bien cette piste!
Calll me a cynic.... But the reason they don't is because it's many times more expensive... 
For the same price as a kilometer of rigid pavement, you can probably build 10 kilometers of flexible pavement.
It looks better as a politician to say "I paved 1000km of roads with our budget!" than "I paved 100km of roads with our budget!"
"But the long term cost of repairing flexible pavement is much much more than the long term cost of repairing rigid pavement!!"
Most politicians are only in office for 4-8 years ;)
As far as I can tell, they are made of concrete under the asphalt. The asphalt is an ablative layer, it's meant to break so everything underneath doesn't.
>easier to repair.
Part of the reason asphalt is used instead of concrete is because it's easier to repair. 
There's a reason virtually every country on earth uses asphalt. It's WAY more cost effective.
Je pense c'est l'explication la plus plausible.
Hahahah
ils annoncent quelque chose comme 2022 mais je dirais plut√¥t 2026 parce que c‚Äôest montreal.
La construction / reconstruction des infrastructures ne finira jamais. Surtout les egouts et aqueducs. Pour des ann√©es et des ann√©es ces infrastructures ont √©t√© n√©glig√©es (car de les reconstruire ne donne pas de bon PR aux politiciens et la publique ne voit pas ce qui est enfoui)
Ben voyons c****!! Je vis pas loin du Stade et c'est le bordel √† l'heure de pointe (et au del√†). Une voie par direction, des rues qui traversent est/ouest bloqu√©es, des agents qui doivent faire la circulation. Le pire c'est qu'on dirait qu'ils refont les m√™mes travaux d'aqueduc √† chaque fois! Je ne vois aucun am√©nagement qui laisse pr√©voir la construction du service de bus rapide en soi de sit√¥t.
C‚Äôest tu la que les jeunes font des drag races avec leurs Honda modifi√©s?
>But the long term cost of repairing flexible pavement is much much more than the long term cost of repairing rigid pavement
Do you actually have a source for this? And not one that comes from a company that is affiliated with concrete paving?
I have trouble believing that asphalt isn't superior over concrete considering virtually every country primarily uses asphalt. I really doubt some random redditors are smarter than the civil engineers and government agencies around the world who's literal job is to allocate billions of dollars to this problem.
So 3 inch deep holes are there by design?
Mainly just main arteries are rigid (concrete + asphalt) ... and depending on the borough, most residential are flexible (asphalt)
So how come in Toronto or Vancouver they don't get giant holes everywhere in the city every spring?
J'aime l'optimisme! Mon vote √©tait soit apr√®s la ligne bleue ou 2030.
J'ai un ami qui vit pas loin de Pie IX. On chillait 3-4 fois par mois avant la peste. Le plus simple si tu viens de l'Ouest c'est de continuer bien plus loin a l'est et de revenir par Viau ou qqchose. Ca sauve un 10-15 minutes pogn√© dans du traffic sur une colline.
I just told you a reason why it might be that most pavements are asphalt. There‚Äôs many, many other factors. 
Feel free to do your own research. 
Be careful of how much credit you give to civil engineers employed by political parties.
Think of it like a pillowcase. It gets dirty by design. If it stays dirty, it's from a lack of maintenance.
Well the basis of your question is wrong.. they do. I've lived in various Canadian cities (including Vancouver) and they all get pot holes. More mild weather in some cities will help reduce the wear and tear on roads, but potholes are a problem everywhere...
The large majority of roads in Toronto and Vancouver (and most places around the world) are asphalt-based by the way. So not sure what you're implying.
Yeah, you told me a reason it "might" be that way based on pure speculation. Speculation that didn't make a ton of sense considering the people working on the transportation departments are there much longer than you said. The politicians don't do the research on what road material to use. They allocate the money to a department that has done a TON of research - and they choose asphalt almost every time - so maybe it's you that needs to "do your own research". 
You're the one making a fairly radical claim, the burden of proof would fall on you - but I think it's clear you don't have sources to back up what you're saying.
I know roads need to be maintained, it's just there are places that don't get giant holes in streets after every winter.
As a civil engineer, my opinion is just a tad bit more than pure speculation, but you didn‚Äôt want to hear that.

I worked in the Sun Life Building until December 2019, also for 15 years.  I went downtown right before Christmas 2020 and was shocked by how much had changed.  Belle Pro and Subway are closed now.  Shout out to all the steamies I downed on quick cheap lunch breaks!
C'est tellement frustrant. Je le vois a tous les jours sur Saint-Laurent. Des gens stationnes dans un espace d'arret d'autobus pour aller se chercher une creme glacee ou quelque chose du genre. Ca ralentit tellement de gens en plus quand tu bloques un autobus.

There are no-stopping signs posted on that section of sidewalk. What need is there for an app?
Il y en avait une il y a quelques ann√©es (Parkng). Tu tapait sur une portion de rue et ca te donnais les interdictions de stationnement, avec un avertissement si elles √©taient en vigueur.
Par contre l'app a disparu pour une raison inconnue (et si tu l'avais encore elle ne fonctionnait tout simplement pu)
If downtown is dead then why not park in actual parking spots instead of blocking the bus stops??? Park properly and you won't get a ticket.
I can confirm, that would never happen.

I have been to the peel pub once in my life and I fought in a bar once in my life.  It happened the same night.
I was told by many a regular that those were good times.

And five minutes is a long-ass time. My bedroom is next to the driveway for a parking garage, and all day long people block the entrance for "five minutes," so I'm trying to do my work from home and there's nonstop honking from people trying to get in or out of their paid parking spot. Half the time the person who blocked it gets belligerent like the person being blocked is in the wrong.
I called the SPVM about it but they won't do anything because "we'll just tell them to move along, so there's no point."
Anyone who does this: next time you're stopped in traffic with people honking like crazy, I want you to set a timer for 300 seconds (5 minutes) and THEN tell me it's not that long.
l'une de mes choses pr√©f√©r√©es √† propos de la vie √† Montr√©al est de savoir que des endroits comme celui-ci sont ici au centre de la ville

Par contre ce qui est d√©plorable c'est le monde qui vient faire des rave party en fichant le bordel. Depuis le d√©confinement il n'y a plus moyen de passer une soir√©e tranquille √† ce spot, c'est devenu un rassemblement √† 100 personnes (la derni√®re fois le DJ √©tait sous acide et la musique horrible... pourtant je sais l'appr√©cier d'habitude). La police chasse tout le monde √† 23h. 
L'ann√©e derni√®re on y faisait des nuits blanches avec mes amis, chill tranquille et BBQ. Aujourd'hui c'est plus possible √† cause que les gens respectent pas le spot et organisent des soir√©es √† 100 personnes pis sont sous drogue
C‚Äôest le Mont-Royal? C‚Äôest quoi ce parc?
C'est en mohawk, le nom choisit par trois communaut√© mowhawk de la r√©gion : Kahnawake, Kanesatake et Akwesasne. √áa se prononce ¬´ djodj√¢gu√© otchira'gu√©n√© ¬ª. En fran√ßais √ßa se traduit en : ¬´ autour du feu, sur l'√Æle o√π le groupe se s√©pare ¬ª.
J'√©tait curieux d'en savoir sur ce lieu. A force d'avoir √©cout√© Serge Bouchard j'ai √©t√© vendu √† l'id√©e de redonner au lacs, rivi√®res et montagnes les noms qui leur on √©t√© donn√©es avant les colons ou du moins qu'on les diffuses. Les noms comptent une histoire et c'est vraiment pr√©cieux. Comme par exemple Pointe-aux-anglais (Port Cartier) qui doit son nom √† une importante trag√©die maritime. Comment les noms d√©c Memphr√©magog ,mot ab√©naquis qui signifie :  le lac dont l'eau est haute et tr√®s √©tendue.  Tu sait qu'a un certains moment dans l'histoire des gens ont exist√©s et ont nomm√© des choses pour se retrouver comme les colons l'ont fait. Je sais pas, pour moi juste √ßa, √ßa me l√®ve le poil de bras lol.

Ah c'est fameux Mohawk qui n'ont absolument aucune terres ancestrales au Canada. 
C'est du r√©visionnisme historique votre affaire. Il faut arr√™ter de pr√™ter attention √† ses fausset√©s
Oui, il y a eu des peuples autochtones avant l'arriv√©e des Fran√ßais, mais pas √† Montr√©al et encore moins des Mohawks
?
Ok c‚Äôest juste le Mont-Royal, c‚Äôest √©trange qu‚Äôil l‚Äôont donne un autre nom
Tr√®s proche de Poly et je n'ai jamais remarqu√© ce parc malgr√© y avoir pass√© 5 ans de ma vie!
>Oui, il y a eu des peuples autochtones avant l'arriv√©e des Fran√ßais
Mais c'est pas une question de savoir si oui ou non il y avait des peuples autochtones. C'est ben d√©bile comme raisonement. C'est une question de donner une place dans la soci√©t√© au peuples autochtones qui ont √©t√©s isol√©s.
Aussi, je comprend pourquoi il faudrait absolument prouver que des Mohawk ont habiter l'√Æle pour y faire un parc. Ils ont occup√© la r√©gion bien avant nous et c'est ben correct de leur permettre de nommer un parc pour nous partager leur vision du territoire, du moins celle de leur anc√™tres.
oh wow les downvotes oh god ahhhhhhhrgggghhhhh
J'avoue que mon comment est assez vague :)
Avez vous vu la largeur du chemin ?  en pierre concass√©e tapp√©e ?  On peut passer un truck de 5 tonnes la dessus.

Ils ont litt√©ralement scrapp√© la for√™t au nom d'accessibilit√© et de drainage des eaux (faudrait pas que les gens aient un peu de bouette sur les souliers, oh non!).  Avant il avait un couvert forestier par dessus le chemin, ils ont tout ras√©.  Machinerie lourde dans la for√™t.

Si on veux pr√©cis et exact ce n'est pas "juste le mont-royal". Ce qu'on appelle commun√©ment le "mont royal" √©tant en r√©alit√© seulement la colline la plus √† l'est des 3 collines qui compose "le mont royal".
Ce park est situ√© sur la colline outremont/murray et n'est aucunement dans l'enceinte du parc du mont-royal.
C'est dans le but reconna√Ætre le territoire Autochtone. C'est un petit geste qui en dit long sur l'histoire et qui aide √©norm√©ment √† la reconnaissance Autochtone, √† reconna√Ætre leur et notre pass√©, nos tensions [principalement li√© √† l'appropriation des terres non-c√©d√©s (vol√©s)], et √† aider √† apport√© un peu de focus l√† dessus. Bref c'est au moins un petit geste pour reconna√Ætre ces enjeux et tensions l√† qui nous coutent vraiment moins que ce qu'on devrait r√©ellement faire, en d'autre mots: *la moindre des choses √† faire*.
C'est pourquoi, et ce de plus en plus, tu va voir des gens r√©f√©rer √† Montr√©al en l'appelant "Tiohti√°:ke" [Djo'-djah'-gu√©] comme OP l'a fait dans le titre.

Non. C'est justement faux. Ils n'ont pas occup√© la r√©gion avant nous. On peut dater leur pr√©sence √† partir du 18e si√®cle. Pr√®s de 250 ans apr√®s l'arriv√©e des colons Fran√ßais
Ca sert ABSOLYMENT A RIEN dans le concret. Serait pas mal mieux de tenir le goivernement actuel responsable de tenir ses promesse pis de donner de l'eau potable aux reserves autochtones qui en ont besoin. Ca c'est juste d'la masturbation intellectuelle pour se donner binne conscience pis faire chier l'monde qui on appeler le Mont-Royal, le mont-royal toute leurs vie.

Nommer un lieu c'est laisser une trace qui traverse le temps. √Ä chaque fois que quelqu'un va lire la pancarte y va se poser la question dans quelle langue que c'est. Si y'est assez curieux y va se demander comment √ßa se prononce. Si y pousse sa recherche y va se renseigner sur qui parle cette langue la et ainsi de suite. Je pense que si un touriste vient visiter Montr√©al et en apprend sur les mohawk ben √ßa aura servit faire dequoi de positifs pour les Mohawk.

That's roughly 250 years
Derien. C'est surprenant. D'habitude j'me fais chier dessus du a mes prise de positions et ma vision du monde. C'est l'fun de savoir chu pas tout seul a trouver ca insignifiant.
On dirait que tu pr√©f√®re juste ignorer l'histoire que d'en apprendre, le but c'est le reconnaissance de l'histoire. C'est tout. Don't blame it on inaction in other issues, blame it on your inability to hold two concepts in your head at one time. C'est pas facile penser √† plusieurs affaires en m√™me temps mes j'pense que t'es capable. √áa te f√¢che d'entendre constamment que ce territoire a √©t√© vol√© ou non c√©d√©, ben f√¢che toi contre l'histoire Canadien et non les gens qui font le reconnaissance territorial.
Bon commentaire. Evidemment on ne peut pas effacer l'histoire, mais donner un nom Autochtone c'est au moins un petit geste qui n'est pas sans importance. On a tendance a penser que c'est les choses qui durent et les noms sonts ephemeres, mais curieusement c'est souvent l'inverse: les mots et les noms restent tandis que les edifices et les traces d'hommes disparaissent.
Discovered? There were already people here, you racist! Jacques Cartier was a tourist and left. He didn't move in.
Rotinonshionni people have lived in this region for thousands of years. What, you think nobody knew about that giant river until the late 1700s? Kahnawake was founded in the 1660s. You're just an idiot spewing misinformation.
Sauf que l√†, c‚Äôest un programme politique et m√©moriel et non de l‚Äôhistoire au sens strict. 
Devoir de m√©moire, tant qu‚Äôon veut.  Mais l‚Äôaffaire des territoires non c√©d√©s, c‚Äôest historiquement discutable dans

Tu sais le nom que se parc avait avant ainsi que la rue de l'est du centre ville n'existe plus, bref tu te contredis toi m√™me.

Pour ceux que √ßa int√©resse, le nom du boulevard a chang√© en 1987 √† la mort de Ren√©-L√©vesque, bien qu‚Äôune petite portion du boulevard qui passe par Westmount (entre Clarke et Atwater) porte toujours aujourd‚Äôhui  le nom de ‚ÄúBoulevard Dorchester‚Äù

They need to paint the lines again, I‚Äôve always thought this.
OP's pictures shows 4 lanes and cars were much bigger then, were did all this space go?
C'est aussi Dorchester √† Montr√©al-Est.

A bit too slick. This shot evokes more of a Waitsian vibe for me.

Why haven‚Äôt they repainted the lanes?  It‚Äôs just weird that people drive the whole length of it oddly weaving down that ultra wide single lane.
Yes nice painted lane would definetly help, but COMMON FUCKEN SENSE still applies when theres no line. Most people seems to lack of it sadly.
It went to drivers who don't know renee is 3 lanes lol
I would think OP means 3 driving lanes + 1 parking / reserved lane
‚ÄúIMPERIAL LIFE‚Äù devient tr√®s litt√©ral dans ce cas
Maybe minimum lane width requirements that must have changed over time making 4 lanes too narrow but 3 too wide. If that's the case they should just extend the sidewalks an extra half meter to fix the middle lane because people clearly get confused rn
Yes, but the only thing keeping people in line (parson the pun) are traffic signals, even then people get it wrong. It‚Äôs the only street where people don‚Äôt drive over the speed limit, it‚Äôs 50 and I‚Äôm always stuck behind someone doing 40 and you are guaranteed to miss the lights doing 40.
Maybe my comment wasn't super clear, but the actual layout is 3 lanes total
I have very different experience driving there in the evening, sometimes nearing triple digit speed once out of the downtown core
Actually it's two lanes of traffic while parking is permitted, three when it isn't. One of the deeper mysteries of living in Montreal.
"Jae-Anthony Dougan‚Äôs Saint-Henri restaurant Tropik√†l, which will occupy the stand until July 27. Its menu includes grilled corn with scotch bonnet pepper butter and a dusting of pecorino romano, shrimp skewers with mango chutney and rice, and a jerk chicken gyro, among other dishes.
Up next will be another Notre-Dame Street restaurant, Afro-Qu√©b√©cois Maquis Yasolo; two-time MasterChef Canada contestant and creator of Elle Jay‚Äôs private dining service Marissa Leon-John; and Evy Mendes, the creator of Cantine Toca Toca, an online catering operation serving vegan West African fare."

Go figure...
>Jae-Anthony Dougan
Guy is a decent chef, his old place in Montreal was pretty good, tried his place in Ottawa that wasn't bad, and Tropikal is decent... but man does he ever charge crazy prices for some of the stuff. 
11$ for two doubles.... that is insane. They are literally two pieces of fried dough, with a curried chickpea mixture and some pepper sauce. Ate them almost every day for a year in T&T and they cost you 3TT, which is about 35c each there. The best west Indian spots in Toronto even you aren't paying more than 1-1.50$ for a double.
I personally prefer talking about culture rather than colour. It‚Äôs West-African or Caribbean or North Indian. That makes sense. 
Saying that it‚Äôs black and brown food makes no sense. Is Louisiana soul food the same as Antillean, Pakistani and Camerounaise now? Is Mexican brown enough? What about Afghani or Egyptian? 
I live this personally with ‚Äúmiddle eastern‚Äù, bitch it‚Äôs Lebanese, not Israeli, Syrian, Or Turkish. Worse are those who through Moroccan in because ‚Äúit tastes similar‚Äù.

All I wanna know is: how good is the food? 
Dafuk does the chef's ethnicity have to do with it, like no other continent but North America would this be a thing.
It should be about cuisine and culture, if there is one thing that is universal and can bridge what ever divides someone feels in society, its that every single person enjoys good food and in every culture, its food that brings people together. 
But unfortunately this hyper-focus around what race, or ethnicity someone is, has crept into even food now.
Some of these people are out there trying to shut down restaurants because they are owned by "white" people, yet are cooking Mexican cuisine.... or what ever else they take offence at. 
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9495559/Protesters-heckle-diners-Brooklyn-taqueria-Derek-Chauvin-verdict.html
I've had amazing French food cooked by a Indian born chef, some of the best Japanese food by a white Australian chef.... good Italian from a Mexican... ect. Good food speaks for itself, and we should embrace everyone embracing other cultures and cuisines, rather than making the focus on what colour the skin of the person cooking it is. Crazy its come full circle from fighting against segregating things based on skin colour, to fighting for segregating things on skin colour.
Welcome to the new Woke Order
> Why is their skin color relevant?
Broadly? Because these are marginalized communities with fewer opportunities than white people, so spaces where they can work are important in closing that gap. 
For this particular story? Because it was set up by a charity focused on offering opportunities to black youths. 
The better question is why does it bother you? What exactly are you "sick and tired" of?

I need you (and many people) to sit down and examine why the idea of a $5 sandwich with a channa masala (which is skill and time-demanding as is any curry) filling is outrageous, but a $10 BLT is not.
Hey there,
Wanted to add my two cents to bounce off of your comment.
Pricing things is a personal thing, as is taste preference.
I agree wholeheartedly that 11$ for doubles is expensive - but that's how he wants to run his business and the people he wants to cater to.
I spent quite a lot of time thinking about why certain foods should be pricey (.e.g. French) and others cheap (all less developed nations). I don't have an answer but at the end of the day, if the food is good, people will pay.
I also know that the profit margin in the restaurant industry is very slim. All this to say I have no idea why he prices things this way, but that I'd keep my mind open as to why.
Have a good day,
Cheers.

Salut,
J'aimerais ajouter quelquechose bas√© sur ma compr√©hension de ta commentaire. Tu me dira si j'ai mal interpr√©t√© quelquechose - √ßa arrive.
Je crois que c'est important de savoir que ce n'est pas a cause qu'on categorise les gens que le racisme existe. 
Et l'humain va toujours cat√©goriser. C'est ce que notre cerveau fait. On cat√©goris√© tout - danger, pas danger, ronds, carr√©, fonc√©, p√¢le... C'est un trait humain. C'est pas en ne pas percevant les "couleurs" que le racisme dispara√Æt. Notre cerveau cat√©gorise tout ce qu'on voit pour survivre et c'est tout a fait naturelle.
Je n'ai jamais dit "je suis X (ethnie)" durant mon enfance et pourtant j'ai v√©cu beaucoup d'actes et de paroles racistes.
Il n'y a rien de mal a cat√©goriser et de percevoir des cultures et des couleurs de peau. Beaucoup de gens issu de la majorit√© ont une g√™ne a dire que quelqu'un est black/africain/asiatique. Clairement, pour identifier quelqu'un visuellement, il faut cat√©goriser. Mais ce g√™ne ne vient pas du au fait qu'on categorise, mais que certains gens lorsqu'ils disent "noir" ou "asiatique" ou "caucasien" dans leur t√™te, ils associent des traits a cette cat√©gorie.
Ce qui est un fl√©au est d'associer des traits et des caract√®res, surtout n√©gatif, a une culture ou une couleur de peau.
J'ai entendu d'une coll√®gue qui cherchait a visiter des.kaisons pour acheter mais qui disait qu'elle n'allait pas acheter d'un asiatique car: "on sait tous que les asiatiques sont tous un peu malhonn√™te."
Est ce que c'est le fait que la dame a dit "asiatique" que ce qu'elle dit est raciste? Ou plut√¥t a cause qu'elle assume que les asiatiques sont tous malhonn√™te?
Just my two cents.
Bonne journ√©e √† vous.
Where the hell do you think the food comes from? Countries with Majority Black people or White people. and the thing is some of these white people don't specify ethnicities or cultures. If it was someone of a culture not in Canada, they wouldn have used the proper ethnic term.
Like West Indian food. Created by countries that are populated mostly by black people so saying "black chefs" is redundant
A charity focused on black youths invests in a project that provides opportunities to black youths. 
You: "NeW WokE OrDer!"
It's a food stall dude, don't eat there if it bothers you that it's run by a black focused charity.
I miss y‚Äôall!
Come on men. No need to be a dick to people
What /u/FrenchAffair said, and also doubles are generally pretty small, and a BLT would be bigger and often comes with a side of fries or salad or something.
If the doubles are as filling as the sandwich and / come come with a similar side, I see no reason why they can't cost similarly, assuming the cost of ingredients isn't that much more.
[deleted]
You're not wrong, end of the day its a business and if people are willing to pay it, then charge it. 
I like to think price should be reflective of the process, skill and ingredients required. A lot of French cuisine is very labour intensive, with long and very precise processes that require a decent amount of training and technical application to get right. Then in addition, often specialized ingredients that are only produced or made in one area with equally high degree of technical process required. 
But then again tons of bad or simple French food is over priced as well.
Le probl√®me pour certain est le diff√©rent traitement d√ª √† la couleur de la peau des gens. En tant que minorit√© visible, c'est tr√®s embarassant m√™me pour des raisons "positives".
According  to this University law professor: [https://www.law.uconn.edu/faculty/profiles/mathilde-cohen#](https://www.law.uconn.edu/faculty/profiles/mathilde-cohen#)
whose recent paper titled "The Whiteness of French Food. Law, Race, and Eating Culture in France".
She writes in the abstract of the paper:
*Food is fundamental to French identity. So too is the denial ofstructural racism and racial identity. Both tenets are central to thenation‚Äôs self-definition, making them all the more important to thinkabout together. This article purports to identify and critique a form ofFrench food Whiteness (blanchit√© alimentaire), that is, the use of foodand eating practices to reify and reinforce Whiteness as the dominantracial identity.*
So, not only are they insensitive, they are expressing structural whiteness, which is inherently racist. An anti-bias, re-education training session is in order.
> Where the hell do you think the food comes from? Countries with Majority Black people or White people
TIL Japan has no food
The West Indies are from from "mostly black" to begin with, and on top of that they are probably the quintessential example of a broad cuisine that is rooted entirely in a melting pot of so many cultures and influences. 
There isn't a single root or origin in any of it, it all draws from multiple sources.
I'm sure that what just a small effort, you can find a way to twist even more my meaning... unless you don,t understand the meaning of the comments here.
10$ for a restaurant BLT is very standard price, even cheap
Exactement
You know in an ideal world I would agree that's fair. I do see the value in it when the scales are as badly balanced as they are now.
Because if you're living in a society where you have say 60% racially aware and 40% who do discriminate in some form or the other, that still translates to a heavy burden minorities need to overcome. Simply saying you have to wait until that 40% changes the way they treat people, means that generation just has to suffer through that time
And when I'm taking about an example of 40% I don't mean just compensating for outright swastika wearing white supremecists, (which is much more rare (though not as rare as I'd like)), but for the more pervasive racism where we have stereotypes we define people of other races with, and the blindspots people with regards to how their perceptions of those races or cultures have been formed either by society around them or in movies and other media, and how those can translate into treating people in destructive ways which we don't notice. 
Ways which are so pervasive that even minorities themselves have a hard time expressing more than a general feeling of malease. It isn't until we dig deeper that we realise how the scales are imbalanced.
So for now, I'm ok with people spotlighting minorities, even if it feels a bit awkward because it's a small effort to provide different advantages for them, because we have not come close enough to provide equal opportunities.
That said, it's important for everyone to be on the same page knowing that this is a stopgap which is in place while we are working on setting up an environment which provides equal opportunities rather than a substitute for one.
Can you define structural whiteness and how it is inherently racist
>So, not only are they insensitive
Oh, I was going with overly sensitive. A play on their name, you know?
Interesting abstract, though I don't enough about food culture per se to have an opinion on it. How does one get access to the paper?
I can see that food snobbery can lead to a sense of superiority, and even nationalism, and I can see nationalism has attracted supremecists. I don't see how  to take one conclusion as a direct causation of the other. It feels like a stretch, but I'm willing to read about it. 
>So, not only are they insensitive, they are expressing structural whiteness, which is inherently racist. An anti-bias, re-education training session is in order
This kind of language always makes me feel uncomfortable. Re-education is a loaded term. Evokes imagery of the whole re-education camps for Uighurs and other cases of ethnic cleansing. 
Like I get what you're saying. A lot of biases we all are bombarded with are really ingrained. For example, growing up, just seeing a character like Apu on TV felt like "hey people in movies and shows are finally being inclusive of those with a sub continental background. Woohoo! I'm being represented!". Years later I see how he was portrayed as "the Indian" and how a lot of the jokes around him (not all) were just mocking his stereotype. After a while you wonder why there are certain races in movies who can never be a hero or a love interest without also being either a token/stereotype or more recently just an educational tool for learning about that race/culture.
But that means I spent years before reaching that conclusion, thinking it's just fine for others to see me with some stereotype colored glasses because I normalized and internalized those stereotypes about myself. And only when it got to the point where I was old and independent enough to see how those stereotypes affected the opportunities around me did I even start to recognize it as something which is not good rather than something that just makes me feel uneasy, but was probably just overreacting. 
So I really can see how there can be the need for harsher language to help jarr people into noticing something is really ***systemically*** wrong. 
But I can also see how it can push people away if you don't have solid, heavy examples which help you support that language. Otherwise you lose the people who you want to reach out to the most.
Jerk Chicken, Rice and Peas? those are broad examples?
Beef Patties and Calalloo?
Oil Down and Ginuep.
These are not common to other parts of the world.
> you can find a way to twist even more my meaning
What did I twist exactly? 
A food blog wrote a post about a new restaurant opening up, and mentioned that the theme of that restaurant is black and indigenous chefs. You said it's because of the "new woke order". What's the meaning I'm missing?
He's not arguing in good faith. He mentioned further down to me that he's being sarcastic. 
In the process taking an actual problem like structural racism muddying the water.
Sure, here's Dr Donald Moss' explanation from his paper titled, "on having whiteness":
[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00030651211008507?journalCode=apaa&](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00030651211008507?journalCode=apaa&)
*Whiteness is a condition one first acquires and then one has‚Äîamalignant, parasitic-like condition to which ‚Äúwhite‚Äù people have aparticular susceptibility. The condition is foundational, generatingcharacteristic ways of being in one‚Äôs body, in one‚Äôs mind, and in one‚Äôsworld. Parasitic Whiteness renders its hosts‚Äô appetites voracious,insatiable, and perverse. These deformed appetites particularly targetnonwhite peoples. Once established, these appetites are nearlyimpossible to eliminate...*
[Don't worry though, an increasing amount of predominantly American multinational corporations are pushing Critical Race Theory and anti-whiteness, anti-bias training for their employees as part of ESG.](https://twitter.com/realchrisrufo/status/1412460830000508928)
&#x200B;
Edit: if you downvote me because I hurt your sensibilities, please explain yourself.
Dude, I was being sarcastic. The fact that you tried to justify any of this moral-grandstanding, self-flagellating nonsense is alarming, although thankfully you expressed hesitation at the re-education camps -- but perhaps it's only a stones throw away considering the onslaught of anti-bias C.R.T training sweeping corporate America? Following historical precedents one could reasonably infer this. (see Chinese cultural revolution or The Bolshevik revolution)
I appreciate your response but you're a little bit behind on the cultural zeitgeist it seems. 
Empathy is good generally speaking. It can also be taken advantage of. Be careful.
Jerk was a process of preserving food by indigenous peoples in Jamaica. It got combined with marinating process of the Spanish & the cooking process (smoking) brought over by African slaves as well as heavily influenced by spices brought by South Indian labours. 
So yea, like most West Indian foods, its a result of a fairly diverse and multicultural mixture. 
Beef Patties.... based on a british cornish pasty, with Indian & local spices.... and you find versions of that all over the world.
Calalloo originally comes from South India. 
Oildown..... commonly with Bread fruit that was again, most common and brought over by South Indian workers... coconut milk.... 
Its not about being common in other parts, its about being unique to the Caribbean because it was pretty much a blank pallet of cusine that was brought together from many sources.
It's the obsession of basing critierias on poeple's skni colour. How about concentrating on the invidiuals as humans and what they share?
Ah, I see, trolling. Carry on, you almost got me. The fact that it's harder and harder to distinguish between a troll and someone's actual beliefs is quite telling.
I'm glad you clarified that you were being sarcastic because the other shit you were saying further down about Parasitic Whiteness really pissed me off, but I was already late for work by that time and didn't reply... 
> The fact that you tried to justify any of this moral-grandstanding, self-flagellating nonsense is alarming
I didn't want to dismiss it outright without reading it. I have been wrong about other things on this topic which I have dismissed as grandstanding nonsense in the past, and like I've described in my last post there have been things which I now see as racism which I'd just assumed as being normal before. 
For example, I didn't understand things like cultural appropriation for a very long time. And while I'm still not personally offended if I see that happening for my culture, I now understand it as something which certain other cultures have every right to feel offended about seeing as what was done to them and what the implications are. 
For all I know there might be a huge element of food snobbery in certain circles which is steeped in racism. Alternatively it could have been that the abstract was written to be eye catching and the content itself would be more reasonable. Either way the topic was interesting to me personally.
Forty years ago my Grandmother was just not being served at a restaurant in France because she mentioned she was Muslim and wouldn't drink alcohol. She learned later that it might be because they just figured she wouldn't tip well because they figured the resulting bill would be lower. So there's definitely place for a discussion about if that was racism/bigotry, or if it was just a case of people caring only about money, or if it is that infamous French service stereotype **or** that immediately assuming *that* stereotype is itself racist. Add more context to the story than what I've shared and it becomes even harder to make the call. 
That said, when people go down the route of dismissing or mocking what they call PC culture, what people forget is how all these small discriminations affect the people being targeted by it. Systemic prejudice is a bigger issue than people realize, and it's only until one spends a lot of time seeing how pervasive it is, that a fair number of things which seem like 'over-reactions' seem a lot less so. 
The only for people to understand that *is* to get people to learn about it, and for each individual to ask themselves "what are the prejudices which I have?" and to teach ones self how to either compensate for them or to work on removing them all together. That's just called people trying to be better versions of themselves. But on a sub where English isn't everyone's first language I can totally see someone calling it re-educating themselves.
> Empathy is good generally speaking. It can also be taken advantage of. Be careful.
I appreciate the advice. Cheers.
For real I'm thinking of buying a bodycam, not only for the masks but for all the crazy fuckers in public places. 
There are some clip on cams that record in loop and are small enough that you don't look like Homer Simpson with a huge cowboy hat!

To Mr. Mailloux Lafrance: (Maybe you will see my message.)
This is terrible. I hope some kind of surveillance footage can be found. The person who hit you is ignorant and a coward.
All the best from another Montreal healthcare worker.
I'm saddened by the comments I saw on facebook, people were saying he deserved this for meddling in other people's affaires... is this what our society has come to? resorting to violence when you're in the wrong and normalizing it?
I hope the anti-masker gets infected with any life-threatening disease and die.

No matter how right you are and how wrong they are, if you‚Äôre gonna beak off at some random stranger on transit and tell them to obey a rule, you‚Äôve got to be ready for them to possibly punch in the face. Considering personal safety from covid and otherwise is the concern, I probably would‚Äôve just moved to another spot. Anti-maskers aren‚Äôt gonna be swayed by being told. That‚Äôs like, their whole thing
I started driving with a goPro precisely because of this. The majority of assholes shut up all that much more quickly when I point at the camera and smile.
Sir I think there's a bee in your hat
How's the legal situation, on that?
Let's assume some people don't want to be filmed, how does that work?
I kinda prefer the Homer look myself now that you mentioned it. I'd only be able to wear it for 10 mins before suffering permanent neck damage but that should be more than enough time to get some share worthy footage...
Tried a new approach at the post-office last week. 
Made a surprised face at the guy and said *Oh, I know you...yeah...you're the guy who doesn't give a shit about anyone around him, right?*
The guy thought it was funny. It brought attention to him and staff told him to put his mask on or leave.
The problem is that it won't be these clowns who die. It'll be their friends, family members and loved ones who contract it from folks who don't give a shit.
I would totally agree if it meant that they wouldn't spread it to non antimaskers, unfortunately, they spread it everywhere and are most likely the reason that virus is still hitting all-time-highs.
I hope they don't catch it, because that means they'll be spreading that shit to everyone else
J'ai les m√™mes opinions.
Small world!
The metro system is full of camera, for sure they have images of the idiot that just hit a random passenger.
The issue now is for the police to find who that person is.
I read the article and the guy was minding his own business. Someone told [angry person] and angry person when on a Shrek rage and punched the first thing he saw.
Or we don't know anything about the assailant?
La mode d'appeler ses enfants "Liam"? Ouai, c'etait ridicule, t'avais des classes au primaires avec 25% des gars qui s'appelaient Liam, et sa s'ameliore pas.

Probably you didn't read the article. Someone had talked to the antimasker. The punched person wasn't even aware of it. All he did was go sit at another seat without even talking to the antimasker. The antimasker sucker punched the guy.
That's precisely what he did. He didn't say shit and went to sit somewhere else. It's an old lady who told the asshole he should wear one. When the poor guy sat down somewhere else, the asshole came after him. Read the article.

Legally speaking, if you're in a public space, nobody needs your consent or your permission to film you.
The only thing you can do is leave, and then if they're following you, it becomes harassment.
Everything visible from a public place is fair game (except defence installations - so, in theory, you're not allowed to take a picture of the Black Watch building). They can bitch, but you are under no legal obligation to stop filming or taking photos.
However, in a private place, you MUST stop once told by the OWNER, the RENTER or an agent of either (employee).
In the m√©tro specifically, taking photos/filming is NOT prohibited from any place accessible to the public, except for commercial projects; so tourists CAN film/take photos for their own use (this means that if you sell a picture you took in the m√©tro, you may be not 100% legal), and if someone who is not a STM employee tells you to stop, you are in no legal obligation to comply.
It is also absolutely LEGAL to film police officers in a public place; this was firmly established during the 2012 student protests.
Lastly, no one has the legal power to force you to delete photos or films from your camera. No, not even the police.
In all cases, photographing/filming is under civil law, not criminal (except for defence installations).
#HOWEVER
In all cases, **in Qu√©bec only**, if you take someone's picture in public and you publish it (in a book, a magazine, a newspaper, a web site), you can be liable for damages, except if it is in a public event, such as Santa's parade or a Stanley cup ~~riot~~ parade.
It can't be worse than all the stupid Tik Tok and other crap people are filming. In Qu√©bec as long as you don't use it for profit you can film and photograph pretty much anyone.
In Quebec, you are not allowed to publish any image without permission. 
[Aubry v. Editions Vice-Versa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubry_v_%C3%89ditions_Vice-Versa_Inc)
If you're in a public place, fuck'em.
I mean, if some guy in the background knows he was recorded when I was filming something else and politely asks for his privacy, I'll blur out his face, but if a Karen has a public freakout, then it's going straight to YouTube.
I find that it's rare that a message gets across with an insult (it worked for you though!). Even if what you are saying is kind of true, it comes off as an insult. Also, better be certain that the person was not wearing their mask on purpose if you take that approach. People sometimes simply forget to put it on. I have and I'm quite mindful about those sorts of things.
That being said, people who are negligent with their mask should step up their game and people who are anti-masks can go F themselves.
Personally I wish them cancer. And to have to be denied treatment because COVID filled the hospitals because of them. Yes, that's asshole of me. Still doin' it.
Plaster his face everywhere and make an example out of this coward. This is getting out of control how anti-mask and Q-anon idiots can get away with being the most garbage human.
>¬´ Les projets de pi√©tonnisation sont bons pour les restaurants et les bars avec terrasse, mais pour les services, comme les salons de coiffure ou d‚Äôesth√©tique, ou encore les restaurants qui font du take-out, √ßa peut √™tre d√©sastreux, parce que les clients ne peuvent pas arr√™ter devant leur commerce 
Les automobilistes sont vraiment des b√©b√©s g√¢t√©s s√©rieusement. C'est quoi le probl√®me avec marcher 5 ou 10 minutes pour aller chez le putain de coiffeur ?
La ville a re√ßu 14 demandes. Le financement est pr√©vu pour 10 projets.
Mont-Royal, Wellington certaines sections de Sainte-Catherine retourneront pi√©tonni√®res comme l'an pass√©. Sainte-Catherine Ouest sera pi√©tonne les fins de semaines. Le reste, on s'enligne pour du hybride surtout, plus de places pour les pi√©tons sans fermer la circulation.
Pour la rue Ontario, une pr√©sentation du projet a lieu demain.
I can't believe wanting to make our neighbourhoods more pleasant is a hot take but man I am here for this *popcorn*
Having a car sucks going downtown, so knowing that find another way to go there? Public transport. Biking. Walking. Or even uber! A taxi. Like any other city.
edit: J' A D O R E les nouvelles insultes fran√ßaises j'ai appris gr√¢ce √† ce thread lolllll
The only downside of more pedestrian malls is having to see all the whiny, passive aggressive tweets from certain politicians who can't seem to wrap their heads around any quality of life improvement that doesn't include "driving and parking more". 
I can't wait for Mont Royal to shut down again.
Yessir c‚Äôest super! J‚Äôai vraiment aimer manger sur une terrasse sans auto et voir du monde marcher. Bcp moins bruyant et plus agr√©able. Aussi je me sens plus en communaut√©.
People are lazy. Just walk the extra 5-10 minutes. Usually you find free parking too and the exercise is good for you. If you‚Äôre with someone elderly just drop them off as close as possible.
La plupart des commentateurs qui chialent ne vivent m√™me pas √† Montr√©al. Coderre √ßa reste un bully. PM a bien des d√©fauts et Val√©rie Plante aussi, mais je ne peux pas croire qu'on retourne au old sherrif in town.

Le centre-ville complet devrait √™tre pi√©ton, √† l'instar de plusieurs villes europ√©ennes. √ât√© comme hiver !
Do any of you have kids family live outside the island? Unless you live in the heart of Montreal, public transit just plain sucks and you require a car. You can't not have a car in Longueuil or Laval or Saint Jerome. The car then has to be dropped off somewhere but we don't have enough parkings at Metro Montmorency for example... so yeah we'll drive and park in the city but then battle with finding spots..
That's the reality, it's not because we are whiny but because we love Montreal and want to spend money into your city ya hipster doofuses. De la rive nord je laisse mon char le plus possible au m√©tro ou train mais ce n'est pas toujours possibles... Et √ßa d√©pend qui est dans l'auto avec moi (des enfants par exemple). J'adore prendre le m√©tro, mais c'est un r√©el probl√®me pour plusieurs d'entre nous. Oui √ßa fait chier mais je comprends 100% l'avantage des rues pi√©tonni√®res.
Je travail malheureusement √† Montr√©al, d√®s que je prends ma retraite je quitte cet endroit qui n‚Äôaccepte pas ceux qui habite en banlieue. J‚Äôai malheureusement une maladie d√©g√©n√©rative qui a affect√© mes jambes et je je peux pas marcher tr√®s loin ou longtemps. L‚Äôadministration Plante et ses disciples veulent une ville sans auto. La REV est un d√©sastre sur St-Denis √ßa prend presque le double du temps a circuler et toutes les rues devenue sans unique pour accommoder les bobos en v√©lo. Montr√©al que j‚Äôaimerais est rendu un endroit qui n‚Äôattire pas beaucoup le monde de l‚Äôext√©rieur, elle va perdre des millions aux couronnes nord et sud.
Lorsque tout les commerces rendront leurs cl√©s on verra qui avait raison. Il suffit d'aller voir la rue St Denis et le r√©sultat ne m√™me pas beau a voir.
J esp√®re que la ville consultra un peu plus les commercant plut√¥t que dicter leur choix d'am√©nagements . Ca serait bien √™tre √©galement qu ils aient des options pour les livraisons,  par exemple, Mont Royal devient pi√©tonne de midi √† minuit, cela permettrait le ramassage des ordures et les livraisons de marchandises. Mais on sait tr√®s bien ce qui se passera et je me pr√©pare au chiard que sera de circuler cet √©t√© a Montr√©al.
Aussi... rappelez vous qu'au dernier sondage,  Projet Montreal a eu 24% ... h√©h√©h√©

Lol comme si on a avait besoin de plus de raison de pas aller a Montr√©al
Genre quand tu vas au centre d'achat tu te stationne dans le stationnement et tu marche jusqu'au magasin  . Tu park pas ton char devant le magasin. Lea gens sont tellement chialeux
Pour Wellington, m√™me cette cat√©gorie de commerces avait majoritairement b√©n√©fici√©e de la pi√©tonnisation. Juste une majorit√© moins √©crasante que les autres. Je pense que le monsieur dit √ßa surtout pour avoir une r√©flexion pour limiter certains inconv√©nients pour certains clients, dans certains commerces. C'est pas difficile √† faire: il faut juste r√©server des zones d'arr√™ts et de stationnements aux rues perpendiculaires et en faire la promotion pour ceux qui en ont besoin. Anyway c'est quoi les chances de stationner direct en face de ton magasin en temps normal? Il n'y a m√™me pas une place par porte en g√©n√©ral.
√áa pis mettre des brouettes color√©es pour transporter les gros achats comme sur Mont-Royal, m√™me si Mario Girard va s'en plaindre dans La Presse parce que c'est ¬´ pas beau ¬ª.
On peut s'adapter et faire plaisir √† presque tout le monde, sauf les plus chialeux qui ont une attirance presque sexuelle sur le parking gratuit de centres commerciaux (et √©trangement doit marcher souvent plus longtemps pour se rendre √† un commerce). Mais on a perdu cette client√®le depuis longtemps anyway.
En plus, tu es un idiot si tu conduis sur Mont Royal (etc.). J'ai une auto et j'habite √† quelques centaines de m de Mont Royal. Je l'√©vite toujours; beaucoup de feux, chaos avec les pi√©tons, chaos avec les gens qui essayent de faire un parallel park avec leur Surburban pendant 2 minutes, chaos avec les livreurs etc. √áa fait beaucoup plus de sens de rouler sur St-Joseph ou Rachel peu importe si Mont Royal est pi√©tonnis√©. And yet...
C'est facile a dire quand on est r√©sident d'un quartier et qu'on connais les rues, les zones de permis et les restrictions. Mais quand on enl√®ve sp√©cifiquement les espaces a stationnement de courte dur√©e pour envoyer les automobiliste tourner en rond dans les rues r√©sidentiels c'est loin d'√™tre id√©al.
Probablement parce qu'ils sont a 25-30 minutes ou plus de marche et qu'ils vont aller se faire couper les cheveux en p√©riph√©rie a la place.
C'est une citation d'un commercant et non d'un automobiliste.  Mais bon √ßa nous prend un crosse-en-rond anti auto.  DAE d√©t√©ste les gros Hummer  (m√™me si on en fait plus depuis 10 ans)?
>C'est quoi le probl√®me avec marcher 5 ou 10 minutes pour aller chez le putain de coiffeur ?
No joke, people are fucking lazy as shit.
One of my coworkers was a personal trainer and now does it on the side. He moved from west island to be closer to work. His new home is a *fifteen minute walk from work*, and on the corner of Fleury and St Laurent. This is most people's dream. 15 minute walk to work and all conveniences close by. He still fucking drives. 300$+ a month on gas and insurance for no reason. It will literally take you less time to just walk to work than it would take to clear a snow dump off your car and warm it up.
My mother (in Laval) will also drive to go to her mom's house which ia literally around the corner, a 3 min walk. She will spend 10 minutes circling looking for the parking spot closest to a store instead of just parking further away and walking 2 minutes. One good thing though, she is happy to park somewhere further and walk around Montreal to get where she needs to go. She won't complain about that the way these idiots do.
I walk 20 minutes to work every day, which is *nothing*, and my neighbour, who also has no car, was shocked and said "wow thats impressive".
Bruh it takes most people a 15 minute walk to get to the bus station or metro. People are LAZY.
J ai mon concierge qui doit se d√©placer d un √©difice a l autre pour les travaux hebdomadaire... le manque d espace de stationnement dans les zones r√©sidentiels sont un gros probleme pour lui surtout depuis qu'ils ont retir√© Sans Consultations des espaces reserv√© aux non residents. Les vignettes temporaires sont pour une journ√©e  mais y a rien pour 30 min... de plus beaucoup de resident du coin se foutent bien des zones de stationnement car ils ont une vignette.. consequence, cette annee, une bonne augmentation de loyer pour compenser les tickets du concierge et mes locataires ont accept√© l augmrntation sans broncher. Donc vous voullez savoir ce qu est la consequence de vos amenagement a faire chier? Eh ben 15% de moins dans votre portefeuille car inquietez vous pas... les commerces et proprio se generont pas a augmenter leurs prix.

> Public transport. 
Not to be condensending but buses are already not great in normal times and reroute will not do them great (especially if people keep using their cars, they're gonna be stuck in traffic jams).
Well 10 minutes each way is 20 minutes wasted. Not everyone has 20 minutes to spare for good fun.
Edit: my internet points :(
a voir les commentaires et down-votes j'en conclus qu'ils veulent pas d'√©tranges dans leurs ville... hahah
[deleted]
Super bon point, mais √ßa sonne pas mal comme un probl√®me sur le mod√®le des banlieues: full √©talement, donc difficult√© d'avoir un syst√®me de transport en commun viable (parce que la densit√© de population n'est juste pas l√†). 
Ton argument serait donc de dire: "puisque les banlieues sont prises avec un mauvais syst√®me, personne n'a le droit d'en avoir un mieux"? Ok, j'exag√®re un peu, but hopefully I make a little sense...!
La discussion ici n'est pas d'√©liminer la voiture pour ceux qui en ont besoin (comme vous!) mais plut√¥t d'√©viter d'encourager l'utilisation de la voiture pour ceux qui peuvent tr√®s bien s'en passer...! 
Chaque fois qu'on √©largit une route, ou qu'on ajoute des stationnements, on ne fait qu'augmenter le nombre d'automobilistes dans un syst√®me d√©j√† satur√©. Quand la population qui pourra s'en passer le fera, je peux vous garantir que vos d√©placements seront bien plus agr√©ables.
C'est un excellent argument √† d√©battre je trouve: l'accessibilit√© universelle. C'est un point √† int√©grer √† tous les am√©nagements. Par exemple, Mont-Royal l'an pass√© avait des r√®gles d'accessibilit√© des terrasses, ainsi que de nouveaux espaces r√©serv√©es en stationnement. Par exp√©rience, ce n'√©tait pas assez? Il faut en parler. C'est important.
Cependant, je trouve dommage de voir ensuite l'argument s'√©loigner de la noble universalit√© de l'espace pour d√©g√©n√©rer en je-me-moi peu inclusif. Les ¬´ bobos ¬ª cyclistes sont des humains qui m√©ritent autant la s√©curit√© et l'acc√®s que les autres.  √Ä rouler √† une vitesse plus basse sur Saint-Denis, vous assez s√ªrement vu le v√©lo blanc dans le viaduc, et bien c'est un mort par un changemen de voie. Plus de 60% des adultes et la quasi-totalit√©s des jeunes font du v√©lo. Plusieurs personnes en situation d'handicap utilisent les pistes cyclables pour se d√©placer, et ne peuvent pas conduire. Je trouve tr√®s dommage de m√©priser ces gens, simplement pour peser un peu plus lourd sur la p√©dale de gas. Je suis 100% d'accord qu'on doit adapter un am√©nagement pour l'acc√®s universel. √áa veut dire aussi que l'automobile doit accepter de c√©der un peu la place aux autres.
Pour une ville ¬´ sans auto ¬ª, elle occupe encore tout l'espace public. Toutes les rues sont accessibles, toutes les rues sont bord√©es de stationnement. L'acc√®s est l√† pour l'auto, universel √† grandeur du territoire. Vous vous plaignez de ne pas avoir tout l'espace et de le partager, dans une ville o√π 50% des gens n'utilisent pas la voiture le matin pour aller au travail.
Il est beaucoup plus facile de rouler en voiture √† Montr√©al qu'il est facile de marcher ou de prendre le TEC en banlieue. Si l'accessibilit√© universelle est votre cheval de bataille, vous devriez √™tre beaucoup plus critique de votre propre environnement.

L'an dernier sur Mont-Royal, les livraisons √©taient permises avant midi (et tol√©r√©e jusqu'en milieu PM...), il y avait de grandes zones de stationnement 15mins √† chaque coin de rue locale, pour les livreurs de restos, ou pour "juste une commission rapide", j'imagine que ce sera de retour cette ann√©e aussi.
Sinon on se rappelle qu'il y a un r√©seau de ruelles faites expr√®s pour la livraison! (oui, faites pour des petits camions, mais on avait pas pr√©vu le train-routier en 1910!) 
En plus, cet √©t√©, la ville n'aura pas de VAS (les voies temporaires actives qui sont apparues de nulle part super rapidement), donc au moins on peut savoir √† quoi s'attendre.

Chapeau!  Tr√®s content qu'il ai agi et qu'une personne faisait du RCR sur le patient.  Les minutes et secondes avant que nous (les pompiers PR) et nos confr√®res les Paramedics arrivent sont les plus importantes pour la survie d'un patient en arr√™t cardio respiratoire. 
Le plus important est d'agir.  M√™me si vous n'avez pas de formation en RCR, les r√©partiteurs(trices) d'Urgence Sant√© vont vous "coacher".  Si vous trouver un D√©fibrillateur: il va vous parler et vous n'avez qu'a suivre ses instructions.  Si vous avez oubli√©: Compressions seulement, 2 doigts au dessus du sternum, profondeur 5-6cm, au rythme de "Staying Alive" des BeeGees.   
Si vous avez peur de vous tromper, dites-vous qu'une personne en ACR est morte... vous pouvez pas empirer l'√©tat d'une personne morte.  De plus un defib. pubic ne peux pas donner de choc a un patient qui n'en a pas de besoin.
He... used all of them?
Everyone needs to be trained for AED use and CPR. There should be AEDs in as many public places as possible, especially public transit stations. Good man.
C'est pour √ßa que ces d√©fibrillateurs sont l√†. Bravo √† l'employ√©!

They're pretty easy to use. All the ones I've seen tell you exactly what to do verbally. Even without training you should be able to use it.
There are a lot of places with AED's now.  Almost every governmental building (fed, provincial and municipal), arenas and sports facilities, shopping centers and even big chain stores like Provigo, Walmart and Canadian Tire usually have them (though not always).  
I've had more than one patient saved thanks to quick action from civilians and an available AED in places like golf clubs arenas and shopping centers.

The early pandemic response of this hospital was very very effective. Consequently they were able to keep this horrible disease outside of their facilities.
Je pensais que l'h√¥pital chinois √©tait ferm√©?
We have a Chinese hospital? I wasn't aware.
Neat!
If only China itself could have kept it away..
C'est devenu un centre d'hebergement pour les ain√©s - cependant, l'institution a decid√© de garder le m√™me nom de 'l'h√¥pital' pour des raisons historiques.
Second sentence of the article:
> A resident at the Montreal Chinese Hospital, a long-term care home located near Chinatown 
Hell it's even in the sub-heading. Not a hospital, just a very divisively named long-term care home that caters exclusively to Asians and is near Chinatown.
They did. They're the ones who implemented an actual full lockdown early on and are basically back to normal now.
Agreed
> just a very divisively named long-term care home that caters exclusively to Asians and is near Chinatown.
L'id√©e c'est que tu as des services de CHSLD en cantonais et en mandarin. Il y a des endroits similaires avec services en grec, italien, hongrois, yiddish, etc.
>just a very divisively named long-term care home that caters exclusively to Asians and is near Chinatown.
It appears that way to people ignorant to its history. Might also be due to one's own racism.
After arresting journalists and healthcare workers trying to spread the word. This was in November 2019 btw. If they had let the word out and closed their international flights at the time, it could have been prevented.
Full lockdowns only after letting it leak worldwide sure.
By barricading people in their homes, would you have preferred that?
Oof, that's one way to look at it.  Another is that they tried to cover it up initially, let it plant seeds across the world, then went full lockdown and refused to accurately and transparantly report on covid cases or the source of the disease to save face.
Except, they aren't.
Edit: Don't know why I'm getting downvotes, but China is far from being back to normal as they want to achieve 0 covid cases before easing their measures.
But hey get downvoted for telling the truth.. it‚Äôs clear where the virus originated.
Aucune objection a ca, mais si tu appelles ton CHSLD Montreal Chinese Hospital quand on a des trucs come Montreal Children's Hospital et Montreal Jewish Hospital c'est que t'essaie clairement de brouiller les cartes et d'induire les gens en erreur. Et c'est sans dire que c'est pas un hopital.

He doesnt even insinuate it, he outright says it. Although he could be given some leeway on the ethnic aspect.
Please explain?
This dude has the hottest takes on the sub, it's like a goal
Absolutely, perhaps I was a bit quick on the ethnic card, it was pretty much extrapolation on my side in retrospect
they're mad that I'm saying Montreal Chinese Hospital is an inappropriate name for a CHSLD because it used to be a hospital and even if it's no longer a hospital it should still be called a hospital because it once was and they like to remember that it was.
Mais that's it, it's a completely reasonable observation. Judging by the responses one would think you were committing a hate crime.
I'm Chinese and looking to work there one day - it doesn't take a genius to point out that having a CHSLD called the Montreal Chinese hospital might be confusing for people when the Jewish general hospital and the children's hospital actually are hospitals. It doesn't take a lot of imagination too to see how pointing this funny little tidbit out isn't necessarily a condemnation of the decision to keep it named a hospital for historical reasons. Y'all need to quit getting your tightie whities in a twist!

Wire rope is incredibly strong. Those are like an inch in diameter. The breaking strength is probably around 35,000 Kgf
Selling those dodge chargers they got and laying off the useless STM security would probably help with that.
Transit systems all around the world suffered temporary shortfalls during Covid, and governments are helping to plug those gaps, to varying degrees. The province needs to take action to address the gap until revenue returns to normal. That's simply what you do when there's a problem with an essential public service. 
(As for why it needs to be the province and not the city, it's a simple matter of revenue. If the city collected the bulk of income taxes then it would be a different story.)
For this particular issue I'd sure feel better with a PLQ, QS, or PQ government than the one we have. It's been a hard sell in Quebec to support Montreal when almost every MNA from the island is in the opposition. But I'll at least give them a chance to get this right before I judge them too harshly.
Stop paying your executive so much. I‚Äôve always felt the metro service to be inadequate in this city. Buses are always late and the metro always had shutdowns on a weekly basis. Not only that but they spend so much money on STM cops to avoid fare skipping, but I don‚Äôt think it compensates for the salary that these guards make.

I have lived all over the world and the STM is by far the worst public transit in a city I have lived in..Seoul and Vancouver had the best. The buses here show up when they feel like it and the metro stops working in peak rush hour regularly. It‚Äôs so bad that at age 32 I signed up for driving school, did that whole process and now drive everywhere even though I live the Plateau. Also, there was an incident with a drunk homeless man yelling on the metro and that was the last straw for me‚Ä¶.the STM sucks at their job. Took public transit my whole life but never again (in Montreal anyway).
FML. Il est temps que nos gouvernements r√©alisent l'importance des transports en commun pour le bien √™tre des gens ET de l'√©conomie.
Chaque dollar investi dans les transports en commun rapportent des meilleures retomb√©es √©conomiques (ROI) qu'un dollar investi dans l'infrastructure automobile, √† long terme.
Les conducteurs chialent sur la STM sans r√©aliser les MILLIARDS d√©pens√©s pour l'infrastructure automobile et toutes les subventions pour le stationnement (sans compter que chaque utilisateur doit acheter et maintenir son propre v√©hicule!) L'automobile comme moyen de transport par d√©faut n'est pas soutenable, c'est une question d'espace!
Avec des meilleurs transports en commun, on peut garder √† peu pr√®s le m√™me taux d'imposition ET tous ceux qui n'ont pas de voiture sauvent des milliers de $ par ann√©e en co√ªts et assurances. √áa revient carr√©ment moins cher! √âconomie 101.

Can they move to a more on-demand model for lesser-used routes and off-peak hours?
Perhaps they should have done cuts when they were locking the province trying to get us to social distance and closing down every other business.  I mean public transportation is a lot more concerning in terms of social distancing than say a book store.  Instead they kept the system running at full scale at near empty capacity for months on end.
Hell they probably could have used the buses as Ubers and saved money during those months the system was so empty.

90 bucks for buses to be 10 minutes late and the orange line to fully stop afterwards. Throw the whole thing out and redo your service, STM
Maybe it's time to CUT the STM useless Cops/Security already?
Keep your car gassed up.
I'm not saying it's an easy job ... But drivers get paid crazy amounts for what they do. The dude's in the booth doing nothing also get paid way too much...

Every time I hear stories about STM security, it‚Äôs not good. At all.
Et faire travailler leurs employ√©s, ts√© quand pendant ton training on te dit constamment de travailler moins vite sinon ils vont grossir ta route, ou que les gars de nuit lavent un bus ou deux et passe le reste de la nuit √† jouer au cartes, c'est pas normal.
√âdith : je parles de l'entretien m√©nager
If I recall correctly, we've come full circle with this one.
1) corrupt and abusive STM security guard 
2) get replaced by actual MTL police, to at least have some kind of standards & hopefully accountability (well, we at least hope that real cops won't hold kids unnecessarily & run pimping rings)
3) back to STM security, let's see how it goes
Everybody is arguing about the cost of these guys vs what they bring in, but also one thing to consider is that the metro is freaking dangerous and these guys help a little bit with that. 
There is on average a violent crime a day in the metro according to stm data. Personnally, i've encountered crazies often enough that I bought my car as soon as I was able to afford it. Not looking to get into fights with coked up hobboes when I'm coming back from work if I can avoid it.
Fix the reliability issues, capacity, security issues and cleanliness issues and maybe people will ditch their cars.
Actually customers paying their fares would help alot, high percentage if non paying riders. The security helps alot by giving out tickets to non paying customers.
Supporting Montreal doesn‚Äôt win elections.
Legault does not really care to applaud Montreal as the major economic hub from which most taxes are collected. Now if it was Quebec City‚Äòs shortfall, there would be no hesitation.
It's an election year, no way they will let that one drop if the news takes traction. It would be the same no matter which party is in power.
Why would transit ever go back to its pre-covid levels, considering the permanent uptake in remote work across many industries?
> they spend so much money on STM cops to avoid fare skipping, but I don‚Äôt think it compensates for the salary that these guards make.
If they pay STM "cops" 2$ for every 1$ in tickets they collect, it can still make sense. If there were no STM cops, we'd save 2$, but STM might lose 10$, because there'd be so many more cheaters.
Your point reminds me of bad executives who think their high salary IT department is a waste of money because they don't have any IT problems. So they lay off half their IT staff and a year later there's a massively expensive long term crisis.
>Stop paying your executive so much.
Maybe they need better executives, not cheaper ones? Unless you want something similar to an IT crisis.
Good to note: I have no idea what their executives are paid and whether it's competitive for the skills required. Do you?
Seriously about the buses being crap. I got on the 144 yesterday (which is for some reason usually 10 minutes early OR 10 minutes late, never on time) and it went a completely different direction & route than what the STM site says. Like what the hell? No signage up at the stop to indicate a change.
They give enough tickets to be profitable, are all of those tickets paid in the end? That I do not know.
The main reason was to keep physical distancing between clients. Even during the peak of the pandemic, the busses on several busy lines were very crowded. 
They did cut on some of less busy lines, but most of them kept their normal schedule, as this it was a recommendation of public healthcare.
Bringing Asian-level or European-level public transit to North America would be amazing but it's a tough sell. People are obsessed with their cars here, unfortunately.
Many cities are in the same category as Guangzhou - much better public transit.
Is there a social point system in Guangzhou?
Communism.
I found public transport in Vancouver to be much better, too.

Il y aura une application mobile qui servira de carte OPUS quand, too?
Merci ! √áa marcher pour moi, j‚Äôai un iPhone XS sur iOS 14 et j‚Äôhabite √† Montr√©al. Je me demande sur quels crit√®res ils se basent pour s√©lectionner les gens.
En 2015 tout le monde riais quand ils ont sortie en grande pompe leur lecteur USB que l'on devais acheter. √áa leur a pris juste 6 et demi developper une application transactionnel mobile.  Sorry to be this guy,  slow clap tant qu'√† moi.
bienvenue en 2010 tlm!!
C'est le temps de relancer #innovercommelastm https://www.pascalforget.com/innovercommelastm/
Bienvenue en 2012!
Tu peux d√©j√† avec Transit. Il nous faut le NFC sioupla !!!!!
Manque plus qu'une carte OPUS virtuelle et nous pourrons dire que nous avons rattrap√© les autres villes.
I got accepted, but I wish this meant we can actually just carry our phones, and not a card
C'est possible depuis longtemps dehors Canada
Faudra un jour que quelqu'un m'explique comment Communauto est capable de recharger ma carte Opus tous les mois simplement avec le num√©ro au dos, mais qu'il faille que les particuliers niaisent avec du NFC et un logiciel propri√©taire ¬´¬†totalement s√©curitaire¬†¬ª.
Just signed up!
C'est tellement retard√©. √Ä Londres je pouvais prendre le m√©tro et le bus avec juste ma carte cr√©dit, m√™me pas besoin d'un t√©l√©phone, il y a 3 ans.
About time!! 
On a deja l‚Äôappli pour le stationnement, y‚Äôetait ltemps qu‚Äôils en sortent une pour le STM!
J'utilise encore leur cochonnerie usb pour recharger ma carte. C'est compliqu√© pour rien st'affaire l√†.
Bonne nouvelle!
Was about time
Nice. That only puts us 6 or 7 years behind the times.
Pour les usagers du train comme moi, est-ce que √ßa m'√©vite d'avoir a valider mon titre de transport a chaque passage ? 
Et j'imagine que √ßa couvre les navettes pour les trains aussi ?!?
Great!!  
Now, change the Opus card design!

M√™me a new York le monde swipe des cartes magn√©tiques alors faut pas virer fous non plus
Je veux pas d√©fendre leur syst√®me d√©su√®te, mais d'apr√®s Wikip√©dia, la carte supporte d√©j√† NFC.
https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carte_OPUS
Ce n'est pas marqu√© que √ßa utilise NFC, mais j'imagine que vous avez raison. Merci au journaux pour nous informer....
Tu veux dire bienvenu en 2009. C est vieux comme technologie
Moi aussi. Au d√©but je riais de √ßa mais j'ai finalement flanch√© et √ßa s'est av√©r√© super pratique! J'ach√®te habituellement des packs de billets alors √ßa √©vite les files et les attentes.
Lorsque le lecteur OPUS est sorti, nous achetions d√©j√† des choses en ligne avec nos t√©l√©phones. Je ne sais pas pourquoi on a investi de l'argent dans cette technologie.
I just put in an order for one 2 days ago LOL and it won't even ship until October... I guess I should cancel my order?
Juste pour pas me taper les files interminables le premier du mois, √ßa valait la peine!
I got accepted
My guess: ils veulent des t√©l√©travailleurs. C‚Äôest pas anodin toutes ces questions sur les habitudes avant et apr√®s covid concernant le nombre de fois que tu prends tel moyen de transport. Ils vont vouloir valider si tu prends plus les transports en ayant acc√®s √† cette technologie
En 2015, Apple ne permettait pas aux d√©veloppeurs d'applications d'utiliser les fonctionnalit√©s NFC.
Si on compare le d√©veloppement du lecteur √† notre industrie de la construction, c'est bien rapide.
Comment?
√áa me semble plus disponible dans transit‚Ä¶
Exactement! Surtout en Asie c'est bien implement√©
Si tu parles de ta passe mensuelle de la STM dans le cadre du programme Auto+Bus, c'est pas Communauto ni la STM qui recharge ta carte. La carte OPUS que t'as contient un titre de transport √† dur√©e "infinie". Tant que tu payes, ils laissent ta carte en fonction. Si tu arr√™tes de payer, ils vont finir par d√©sactiver ta carte OPUS.
Every phone I chose disqualified me so they might have criteria on the demographic and/or location.
Ouf, faut pas se comparer aux USA pour les modes de paiement, les ch√®ques sont encore tr√®s communs. La puce sur les cartes est une nouveaut√© pour eux.
Oui mais, il y a un [syst√®me](https://new.mta.info/system_modernization/omny) qui est disponible depuis 2019 en NFC et il vont l'avoir mis en place compl√®tement en 2023.
Il y a des endroits qui ont ou ils ont confirm√© qu'il va y avoir des NFC ou des paiements sans contacte dans [les villes suivantes](https://www.nfcw.com/technology/metro/):
* Londres
* Frankfurt
* Tokyo
* Sofia
* Moscou
* Paris
* Dubai
* Stockholm
* Dehli
* Boston
* Beijing
* Shangai
* Milan
* Helsinki
* Barcelone
* \[...\]
Oui, je lis mes titres en NFC.

C'√©tait pas vraiment une grosse d√©pense publique, c'est des lecteurs de cartes qui existaient d√©j√† sur le march√© et on les vend, on les donne pas. C'√©tait une solution rapide qui faisait la job en attendant qu'on change le syst√®me.
Pas tout √† fait vrai.
Les d√©veloppeur peut mettre leur carte virtuelle dans Wallet.
En plus pour le transport en commun, il y a le mode express card qui est utile‚Ä¶ pas besoin de d√©barrer le t√©l√©phone pour l‚Äôutiliser. Plusieurs compagnie de transport utilise cela. Plusieurs autres compagnies aussi l‚Äôutilisent pour tout ce qui est activable normalement avec une carte nfc
C'√©tait un projet pilote de l'ARTM qui s'est fini en juillet, une des mesures de la pand√©mie. Tu pouvais acheter des billets unitaires valides dans toute la r√©gion pour l'autobus seulement, et √ßa s'achetait √† partir de l'application Transit ou Chrono.
Et m√™me Ottawa !
Donc le t√©l√©phone pourrait √™tre utilis√© sur les bornes?
Thanks for sharing, that's an awesome app!
Just like the pink line, this is never going to happen. Would be really nice, though.
Je viens de me rendre compte que la section au nord de C√¥te Ste-Catherine est √©galement couverte dans cette image. L'image montre donc toute l'autoroute couverte √† l'exception de la partie qu'il a d√©clar√©e (et qui a √©t√© rapport√©e dans les m√©dias locaux). A√Øe¬†!
Je suis tr√®s content que de projet reviennent en avant plan, la derni√®re fois il avait √©t√© propos√© par Richard Bergeron alors √† la t√™te de Projet Montr√©al.
Mais la r√©alit√©, c‚Äôest que ce n‚Äôest pas Montr√©al qui doit payer pour √ßa, mais le minist√®re des transports. R√©parer une telle erreur, peu importe le co√ªt, ce n‚Äôest que rendre justice aux r√©sidents de ce secteur.
(Je crois que) Montr√©al a besoin de plus de pouvoirs √† ce niveau. On est la plus grande ville au Qu√©bec avec les universit√©s, les gens, les compagnie, la tech, les revenue et la population mais on doit faire du begging pour construire des projets de transport en commun qui b√©n√©ficieraient l‚Äô√Æle aux provinciales. Makes no sense to me. Ceci n‚Äôest pas pour dire que Montr√©al est mieux ou meilleur que les autres grandes et petites villes, mais come on, notre budget est tellement petit pour tout les projets de bon sens qui aidera les gens qui habitent l‚Äô√Æle.
Je sais que ce que je dit ne pla√Æt pas beaucoup de gens mais je vais voter pour la personne qui demanderont ce genre de statut sp√©cial pour la ville de Montr√©al. Its alright if you hate what I say, I‚Äôm okay with that!
Coudonc, y est rendu √† combien de projets, Coderre? 569? 872? J'ai perdu le compte....
Yeah, right, Denis. Been there, done that, not buying anything this BS artist is selling anymore.
Ca va √™tre si attrayant d‚Äôaller relaxer et marcher trois coins de rue entour√© par des boulevards urbains √† 4 voies.
C‚Äôest limite r/ABoringDystopia comme projet: un p‚Äôtit crachin de verdure dans un oc√©an de b√©ton et de chars.
Ben oui, imaginez le bordel de fermer D√©carie pour rendre √ßa "plusse beau". Si ils ferment que les fin de semaine pour effectuer les travaux √ßa va prendre 10 ans. Des belles promesses √©lectorales facilement oubliables une fois √©lu.
y'a pas de pistes cyclables  ?    
/s
J'suis sur que ca va couter pas couter cher en plus!!
So there are a lot of great comments here but, just to be clear, I posted this not because I wanted a debate about whether it's possible, but rather because what the image shows is the opposite of what Coderre has proposed.
Coderre said he wants to cover the section between Queen Mary and Cote St-Catherine; this is on the Ensemble website and it's what's been reported
But look closely at the image above: that covered section is from Cote St-Luc to Queen Mary. The Queen Mary to COte Ste-Catherine section has actually been left uncovered in the above image. The covered section then seems to begin again at Cote Ste-Catherine
It's funny because, obviously the person who did the rendering misunderstood Coderre's team's instructions, but they're running the image anyways because they know most people won't notice
related fact: paris has 2 million people and not a single highway. not an elevated one, not an open sewer like decarie. 
we could save money on a life without urban highways, or we can spend money hopelessly trying to make urban highways socially acceptable.
La longueur maximale pour un tunnel est de 125, sans s√©curit√©, ventilation, etc.  C'est pourquoi Coderre a fait 125m √† c√¥t√© du Chum. C'est pas faisable, et il le sait probablement.
Wasn't this already in Project Montreal's plans?
C'√©tait pas d√©j√† quelque chose qui √©tait entam√© comme projet?
[deleted]
Geez without any road work that highway is a shit fest, imagine if this happens
Couvrir de quoi!?
de la tarte aux pommes
Coderre en prend de la vraiment bonne mais il devrait slacker un brin.
Bullshit lol
Never gonna haooen under coderre.
Oui un beau tunnel couvert pour aller chiller avant d‚Äôaller magasiner dans l‚Äôaffreux capitalistland 15/40...Oubliez moi pour Coderre √† la Mairie, je reste avec Val√©rie. Fait que les gens bougent leur cul et ne voient plus le v√©lo comme un loisir...
Denis Coderre: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to cover Decarie‚Äù
Mayor Coderre: ‚Äúno money to cover Decarie, sorry!‚Äù
more piste cyclable!!!!
This is a must do project, please let me know how I may support and contribute to that vision
C'est poche un parc entre des routes super achaland√©es, √ßa va finir comme celui sur le bord du vieux port o√π y'a juste les itin√©rants qui se tenaient l√†.
This will cause much more traffic in the area than Royal mount project.
I like it. It‚Äôs been long overdue, will it happen? Doubt it, but hey weirder shit happened before.
Update: so I‚Äôm getting downvoted? Wow
Let's worry about getting a bilingual island/equal language rights for anglophones in Montreal before we waste money on this nonsense.
Omg just fucking pave the roads and cut taxes wtf is wrong with these idiotsss
Why is everything Coderre proposes terrible just because Coderre is proposing it? I don‚Äôt think this is so bad I think people in my class suggested this in the past
Yeah, I'm still pissed off with Projet for proposing a metro extension they knew the Quebec gov't would never allow Montreal to do on its own
They should have argued instead that Montreal needs the authority to plan its own mass transit, something the gov't of Quebec currently prevents
As to this project, don't get me wrong - I am 100% in favour of covering over all the exposed highways and putting parks or new buildings on top. This has worked really well with the Ville-Marie expressway so far
The problem is the cost, and the only way to offset the cost is to rezone some (or perhaps most) of the lots along the expressway to allow high-density and much taller buildings. So now we're building condo towers along the highway, facing the new park, and charging high property taxes to offset the cost of covering over the expressways.
That said, covering the expressways - and installing some kind of air filtering system for the tunnel - is probably the best thing to do in terms of our environment. The Decarie has left all of NDG/CDN covered in grime for 50+ years, it's time things change
This is nothing like the pink line: Plante *believes* in that project. Maybe it's overly ambitious and a bit naive even, I don't know. It was her pet project and she has never given up on it. On the other hand, that idea from Coderre reeks of electoral desperation. It's not sincere, and as the image shows he didn't give it much thought, he just bet that enough voters would just think "Coderre is green as well, I'll give him my vote".
And the green pedestrian bridge on the Turcot :) don't forget that selling point!
Est-ce qu'ils vont payer pour la 40 aussi? Au lieu de la refaire exactement pareil :facepalm:
I agree with you, Montreal should have special status similar to Toronto.
Y a ben des chums avec ben des projets a financer.
le nombre de projets grossit comme... son tour de taille.
edit: les/le
He'll be the new mayor taking over for the flake currently in office.
C'est pas sans rappeler le [Parc Bonaventure](https://goo.gl/maps/JQqgnbJj35vVkSSN9).
C'est quand m√™me une nette am√©lioration sur l'autoroute qui √©tait l√† avant, mais mettons que c'est pas en haut de ma liste de parcs pour faire un pique-nique...
Baby Bonaventure. 2-3 voies au lieu de 4. Tr√®s relaxant. /s
Pourquoi /s? Ce secteur n'a aucune bonne piste cyclable nord-sud, √ßa serait le bon moment pour corriger √ßa!
Oui, dans le tunnel! Les voitures sont pas permises.
Paris a un syst√®me de transport collectif pas mal mieux que Montr√©al. Paris se situe dans un pays plus petit que le Qu√©bec o√π il y a plus de transport interurbain (trains) et l‚Äôautoroute qui est autour de Paris est un stationnement (ils l‚Äôutilisent beaucoup cette autoroute!) Les qu√©b√©cois sont pas pr√®s de se de se passer de leurs autos, y‚Äôa pas vraiment de solution alternative ad√©quate sauf quand tu habites dans un quartier central proche d‚Äôun m√©tro, √† moins que tu veuilles passer des heures dans l‚Äôautobus/m√©tro.  Et √©tant donn√© que tout le monde vie d‚Äôun bord ou l‚Äôautre du fleuve, pas le choix d‚Äôavoir des grands axes tant que les ponts passeront par Montr√©al.
Le periph ressemble pas mal √† une autoroute
Look closely at the image
Coderre said that he wants to cover the trench from Queen Mary to Cote Ste-Catherine
In the image, that section was left uncovered
It's still on his website - he doesn't realize the image he's showing shows the opposite of what he's saying
That's not really the point - look closely at the image
Coderre stated his plan is to cover the trench from Queen Mary to Cote Ste-Catherine
The image shows the trench covered from Cote St-Luc to Queen Mary, then \*uncovered\* from Queen Mary to Cote Ste-Catherine, then covered over again
In other words, Coderre said he wants to cover a section of the trench, but the image he's using shows that specific area as being uncovered
And he hasn't yet noticed...
ask the CAQ for $1 billion from the Transport Ministry's budget
It's a neat idea, but it's also funny that Coderre is running an image of a proposal that's the opposite of what he's said to the papers and is on his own website.
Well someone missed the point
Complain to the city to install portable toilets somewhere in the old port for them. They did that in the plateau and the homeless people poop there.
Vote for politicians that will put more money into social services.
Install a sign with a poop emoji with a red circle crossed on it.
 üí©+ üö´
And that should do the trick.
Very bright motion activated security lights.
Tu baisse tes culottes, tu pop un squat a coter du gars pis tu le regarde dans le brun des yeux.
I'd install a motion sensor strobe light or something equally as attention grabbing, that should do the trick
Donate your money to [Mission Old Brewery](https://www.missionoldbrewery.ca/). They're next to your place.
call public works incessantly
I say shit before the homeless, show them that this is your territoryü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Malheureusement il n'y a pas grand chose √† faire mais tu peux aller voir √† ton poste de quartier. Si plusieurs voisins et toi porter plainte, la police fera plus de rondes dans le coin.
Install a camera. Unfortunately for homeless people, they will most likely not care, but the video can be provided to the police and such if you need to escalate the situation.
harass your borough councillor for safe injection sites   
when I lived on the plateau it was always the people shooting up losing control of their bowels
Someone in this thread hasn‚Äôt figured out nuance yet‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs okay to think that homeless people should get the help they need, vote for politicians who cares about the situation, AND not want people *literally* shitting in your driveway.
You can do all three, you don‚Äôt need to be this knight in shining armour for social issues and tell then basically tell someone to get fucked when they want help preventing the mentally ill and the homeless from using their property as a god damn toilet. Grow up. You think your favourite politician is gonna come down in the middle of the night and hiss at some dude with his pants down to scare him away?
People are naive.
So, as some people have already said: motion activated lights, cameras, perhaps an alarm of some kind? Sorry you have to deal with this.
That is a major health hazard. Harass the city to do something. Take photos, call the media.
If you have a serious homeless problem, contact the city and ask them to put a MrJiggs in the area... I too am in Ville Marie and had the same issue.. for a quick fix, get really bright  movement sensitive spotlights  .. not the winky dink light bulb kind ...get  one or two 2 spotlight light fixture and install them in a way that the moment they set foot on your property they go off.
Install a portta potty near your place? Support social programs that can help curb the issues that lead to people being homeless? Hire a cleaning service for a cyclical cleaning?
Living downtown in any city has its drawbacks. You are just being confronted to the fact that even the people abandoned by society have basic needs.
Install a porta potty. Do your part yo help the homeless. Mind you, one of them might move into it though!
Get raccoons for your alley
Get a motion detector spotlight/strobe light perhaps? Or an audio alarm might work.
311 or https://montreal.ca/en/contact-city also live in the same neighborhood, with the same issues. Sorry it's causing you and your family problems. If it's happening multiple times, it's probably the same person/ people... strong lights or an alarm ...?

My parents have a bright spotlight in the driveway that is motion activated and it would scare away most people trying to take a piss or poop. My dad did that after some drunk guy leaving a nearby bar, that no longer exist, smashed their car window back in the late 80s or early 90s.
One time, one guy was stubborn and still decided to proceed and get ready to do is business. My dad yelled at him to leave and he was still getting ready to do his business. My dad filled a bucket of water and poured it on the man from 2 floors above.
Rottweiler
Lived in the old port. Used to catch people shitting outside my apartment all the time. It's part of the reason I moved out. Its not really a livable spot long term IMHO.
Elect better politicians
It comes with the territory.
Get a camera, create a YouTube channel, tag your local politicians incessantly. Also, motion lights do wonders (6 pack of solar ones in Amazon for $40).
Human waste has no place in civil society. It's the absolute bare minimum for a working society. When people get to this point they shouldn't be allowed in public.
Motion activated water sprinkler
Put a water sprinkler out there‚Ä¶when the poopers show up, hit them with your best shot
Cam√©ra, 311, et poste de quartier.
Installes des cam√©ras pour prouver les faits.
Communiques avec le 311 pour demander de l'action
Transmets les vid√©os des gens qui vont ce geste la au bureau du maire de l'arrondissement, de la ville et a la police et sur les r√©seaux.
One of the things I hated about  living downtown/ old port. Shit every fucking step.
Pellet gun to the butt cheek.
le vieux porc.
Mets des boules √† mites dans ton jardin
Motion controlled sprinkler system . It keeps the racoons out of my garden at night.
Go
Out and watch them, bring them a magazine and toilet paper, maybe pull up a chair and start talking to them
Politely ask them to go poop in a park, or in a mcdonalds
The simple is to talk to them, permission them to access your bathroom. Put up a sign stating that if they're in a bind to knock or ring a doorbell. (involve nearby neighbors toilets) this shouldn't really become a nuisance, any more than having to clean up the alternative mess.
1. They're human, neighbors, on hard times/hard choices.(I've been there)
2. Get to know them better & dissipate unfounded fears in the process.
3. Familiarity creates an opportunity to help each other, us & them.
The fact is, you & they live together, collaborating will involve some compromises. I do not know details of your neighborhood(to determine what a homeless persons actual options are in this case), but this is a true issue in much of the city, the lack of public toilets. Our local park has open doors on a central building much of the time, but i know that downtown, when the stores are closed, there isn't much to choose from for places to defecate.
 It's funny a population this size does so little to influence the cities need for such places.
Although if you do not wish to become involved, you could handle it like people with dogs and put some grocery bags and toilet paper and a sign out there and hope they poo in the bags. :)
''how do I stop them from pooping''  suggest a habitual thing and I'm not buying it. The homeless I understand are not the cleanest but 'how do I stop them from \*\*itting in my driveway' is stretching it. I call exaggeration. (Homelessness)What Country did you move from for this to appear as new phenomenon? Sincerely It is unfortunate if your family has been made uncomfortable but some neighborhoods are better than others. Talk to the police & hope you guys stay safe.
This is sad on many level. Short answer:camera (real or fake shouldn‚Äôt matter)
Depends?
Move away from downtown
Montr√©al never ceases to amaze me with its lack of class
Motion activated water sprinkler
Cone to the suburbs
Funny this is you can look up Public Restrooms in Montreal, and realize we had some everywhere and even with Amazing Architecture. 
But we removed them all.
Look up 'Montreal Vespasiennes' 
It's the term used for public restrooms.
Also I might ad that with modern tech, self cleaning toilets is an easy thing to do... Unless your a politician.

Hahahha
Lobby the 3 levels of Canadian government for universal access to housing and housing as human right. And in the mean time, complain to the city to install portable toilets so people don't have to defecate in public and have access to toilets.
Have compassion. I‚Äôm sure being homeless is not easy. It‚Äôs crappie that this happened in ur building...
