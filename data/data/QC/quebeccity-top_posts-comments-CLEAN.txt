do you have a license? i thought amateur drones were banned over quebec city.
wow. it's not an angle we often see.
calvary yes!
beautiful!
legault su'l bol: is that what matters?
good shot, same man!
really beautiful the effect of the flag beautiful point of view
it puts the city in perspective, that. niiice
wowwww nasty beautiful shot

nice!
we are not talking about license but certification for drones (tele-piloted aircraft system or satp for transport canada)
most of quebec city is in a class c controlled zone from the ground up, which requires advanced operations certification and authorization from nav canada. as of february 25, 2021, 4,980 pilots had advanced certification in canada (source: tc satp team newsletter 'drone zone' february 2021)
in addition, you need a rpas capable of going into a controlled area, so with a manufacturer's declaration and meet certain design requirements. to go less than 30m or 5m horizontally from people not involved in the flight, you need other declarations, more complex to respect.
note that none of this is necessary for a satp of less than 250g like a dji mavic mini 2.
for the flight in question, it appears to be just outside the controlled area. the questions are then where it took off (if it is on parks canada land, it is not allowed) and if the drone weighs between 250g and <25kg, if it was less than 30m horizontal or 5m horizontal from people not involved in the operation, according to the manufacturer's declaration. in addition, was the drone at all times in the pilot's field of view or visual observers in communication with the pilot which is necessary for legal flight.
so the short answer is, it is possible that the theft was legal, but it is likely that one or two regulations were not followed.
for reference: map of where drones can fly (don't understand take off or landing): 
rules: canadian aviation regulations, see section ix: 
i am a pro with my drone;)
there is always one who needs to ask this question lol
shhhhhhhhhh, c bô
thank you for your nice answer :)
the flight was surely illegal, for flights in urban areas, it is not just the weight of the device, but the height of the flight! it is clearly at a flight height that he must have a license and also an authorization from the governmental authorities of the different levels to be authorized, so this flight was almost certainly illegal.
tabar!
you know your subject toé!
watch out for fines bud ;)
hello, i am the fun police: do you have your papers?
yes it is excellent! 👊🏻👽
there is no distinction between urban or rural rpas flights as of today's regulation (changed since 2019, which is also different from the 2017 provisional regulation). only the proximity to people unrelated to the operation will significantly change in the city from a regulatory point of view.
the maximum altitude is 400 feet (122m) above the ground or 100 feet above a structure if the structure is within a radius of 200 feet horizontal, whichever is greater.
source: canadian aviation regulations, part ix
> ** 901.25 ** ** (1) ** subject to subsection (2), a pilot is prohibited from operating a remotely piloted aircraft at an altitude greater than one of the following altitudes:
>  
>**a)** 400 pieds (122 m) agl;  
>  
> ** b) ** 100 feet (30 m) above a building or structure, if the aircraft is operated at a distance of less than 200 feet (61 m), measured horizontally, from l building or structure.
>  
> ** (2) ** the pilot is permitted to operate a remotely piloted aircraft at an altitude above one of the altitudes provided for in subsection (1) if he does so in accordance with a special flight operations certificate - rpas issued under section 903.03.

there is only one authority in canada for in-flight drones and that is transport canada. therefore, to fly in canada, the only level of government with the right to request authorization is the federal government, under the aeronautics act. however, cities can regulate take-off and landing areas, put rules on voyeurism or other regulations that may affect aviation or drones, if these are not specific regulations for the flight of devices.

> ** 4.2 ** ** (1) ** the minister is responsible for the development and regulation of aeronautics, as well as the control of all sectors related to this field.
available here: [ /lois/a-2/page-2.html#doccont)
i also see your mention of
>license
we are talking about certification for aviation. for example, i am a certified pilot for advanced operations, either in a controlled area, close to individuals (<30m horizontal) or above individuals (<5m horizontal). if i want to fly above 400 feet, i can apply for a special flight operations certificate.
i'm curious, where does your info come from? i like to know the sources of information of non-pilots on drones and aviation in general.
haha i don’t need a license i have a mini 2
sometimes the fun is to understand how things work. but continue to preach ignorance .. it looks like real american teenagers '' boooooooooooorrriiinnng don't wanna hear it, not learning any new facts today or tomorrow or ever,
i've got tiktok, trump said it was bad, so therefor
 its the best tool for free expression and it will make me smarter than all you boomers who ask questions' booooooo knowledge sucks, let's join up with every fucking divided group of society who now all fucking prone anti-intellectualism.  
everyone is pushing for a return to the dark ages.
but what a fucking hell
what temperature?
gorgeous
fun fact: at the far right of your picture is where the first french settlement in north america was built, in 1608.
attractive. the weather is perfect.
pretty, temperature is on point.
it really is a beautiful photo, thank you very much for sharing it with us!
ooh i don't know, that was last year. sorry. but very beautiful because i rode my bike all day.
cool fact bro!
wasn't the first french settlement built in port royale in 1605 or 1606?
it's my pleasure :)
don't worry, he's a granny. some time ago a tourist posted a photo of château frontenac with a title like * le château à 34 ° *. it has been resumed in all sauces since.
which street in quebec? vrm nice shot🔥
bo toutou
miaw
he looks smaller than he really needs to measure.
beautiful photo.
beautiful baby
it is the rue du sault-au-matelot.
charlesbourg has changed 😮
before the people of the region come to settle in charlebourg, mongolian radio broadcasts start off and give our city an image of mardy.
what an incredible photo, i would be curious to see others similar for limoilou, beauport, haute ville…
now imagine it in 2107
the dufferin terrace hasn't changed at all
people of the country
what about the little champlain ?!
in 1935 we had nazi parties
ah! i was writing this to someone recently in air quebec and it put him in a beautiful green joual. but it's the same! when i moved to montreal to continue my studies in 2001, just in my neighborhood, i regularly met people i had known at cegep (limoilou) and at u. laval. just last week i went to a new hairdresser, still in the same neighborhood, and she was from sillery, who left around the same time as me. there are also some in my community garden, there were also some among the parents of my children's primary school students. strangely, it looks like we recognize each other (there is even one whose mother had kept me a few times when i was little on the côte-de-beaupré and who came to see me because she recognized me by my son's face! anything!), but we come from a world that no longer exists. my partner is an engineer graduated from u. laval and even if he is offered paying jobs in quebec, he does not want to know anything. doing a technocratic job is one thing, but living in a technocratic atmosphere, he doesn't want to know anything!
there are 7 pages for the ad only.
another rabbit hole here: 
there is a search box by word.
well, quebec is not really the country. it votes opportunistically, it doesn't really have a principle.
for real it is a joke. there's no way we could miss 1935. the city must have been half english at the time too
i don't really understand your comment. i was saying that people from the region settle in quebec, but especially in its suburbs. several ham radio presenters come from regions (that can be understood by their accents). but it is not representative of the rest of the city at all. you seem to have a pretty negative opinion. things have changed since 2001. there is a really nice vibe in the central areas, the culture is bubbling. several artists and artisans have settled there for ten years. the population is more and more diversified and densified. maybe generation x people like you left before the city got cool.
aah a big thank you!
excuse but i don't understand anything
🤢
:o
i know there is a great vibe in the central districts, i still have friends there that i visit regularly. but your comment was about the settlement of areas not yet developed in the photo by people from reactionary places. want, don't want, it still has an influence on the atmosphere. also our families are in the suburbs and god damn it it's heavy. recently i went to a small shopping center in beauport and the charging stations for electric vehicles were all vandalized. not graffiti, but scrapped (cables cut) and therefore unusable. in my neighborhood the terminals are dirty and graffiti, but no ham proud of the oil in his suv would cut the cables. it's just so delayed.
a little welcome in order to not stay long, plans for me to go burrow into banq's online resources and not do my job!
much love from qc, hope we're able to get you to visit soon!
wishing you the best too.
we are all looking forward to the end of this pandemic.
ditto! i miss the new england area and the american road trip vibes. the white mountains, adirondacks, american hiking trails, the new hampshire and maine beaches, the beautiful baxter state park. excited to be able to come back!
what i'd give to sit and have a beer at le projet tonight.
come visit us soon.
goodbye!
i miss maine too, buddy. old orchard beach and the portland area has a special place in my heart since childhood.
i miss the beach and the seafood.
i've been to old orchard beach, maine since 2001 every, single, summer... except last summer, for obvious reasons...i broke that 20 consecutives years streak
i miss maine as well...
your comment warms my heart on this cold day. i cannot wait to come back soon in your beautiful state. be safe.
i never been to maine but i really want to go. you’re always welcome in quebec city!! ✌🏼
same thing for me, i miss maine. lots of very nice folks there! take care!
here is a cool view of the château 
the road from québec cité from maine looks so nice!!! northern maine looks really gorgeous!
i wish i could have gone to maine last year, i love going to acadia national park and old orchard beach.
is qc still on lockdown? like no entry/exit?
and vice versa...
i think we are though the middle of this. i hope you and i are visiting each other’s countries soon. best to you. :)
border supposed to open within a few weeks now that the pandemic appears to be on recess for good. up for both federal authorities to lift the gate now. my situation is the exact opposite as the poster from maine above. i was born and raised in maine but been living in quebec city for almost 40 years now but my relatives and lifelong friends are down there and i .miss them dearly. hi y'all, hope to see you soon!
i love this pub!
i’ve been to winter carnival every winter since 2000. 
and, unfortunately broke my streak too. perhaps the lesson in this catastrophe is to better appreciate what we have. you will be in oob and i will be in qc again. :)
pleasure for me too my friend. thank you. i just told maine to expect you soon. :)
thank you. great views.
it’s a beautiful spot. great drive. great poutine in st george's ashton :)
canadian border is closed with the usa since march 2020. any traveller that come to canada has to do a mandatory 2 week quarantine, from which 3 days in a hotel for 2000$, not negotiable. we've been in a lockdown and half lockdown for 10 months out of the 14 months this pandemic lasts. as of now and since october, all restaurants and bars are closed. since the end of january we're under curfew, masks are mandatory inside, gyms are also closed since october. however that might change soon, curfew will be lifted next week end (not this one) and restaurants and gyms will open in june, bars maybe at the end of june. all this because mass vaccination is ongoing faster than previously thought. movie theaters will be able to open in june also.
i live there lol first time i see someone talking about my city and yeah it’s pretty good
mario galaxy leak! 😂
the number of degrees above is fucked up
wow it's amazing
ah, i see you're a man of culture as well

that’s just home 😇
the city feels more like woodstock than europe if you travel there in july during the feq. they have that park that's shaped like an amphitheater with a capacity of over 100,000 that seem to attract every big name in the rock music business, be they from the 70's or current. for a city of that size it's not that common to have such a bounty of quality entertainment i am told.
as for looking european old quebec is somewhat reminiscent of normandy but also of southern england. much more so than france actually. with most of their ancestors originating in normandy, brittany, poitou and even ireland, there is no latin flavor... except in their festive spirit 😄
amazing photos..our one day there before the lockdown was cold and rainy....hope to come back in september
i'd move to qc on a heart beat if i spoke french and if they had a cfl team.
literally one neighborhood
yeah. i've heard several times that quebec city feels like a european city but to me that's just the quaint/touristy part of town.
there'd be latin flavour, but the cultural institutions, be it public or private (québécor) don't do enough for diversity.. and, there's a lot of latinos in québec city.. but their place in the touristic and cultural industry is that of servants with horrible salaries.
and landlords don't follow the rules & laws with them because they sure can get away with it.
we have a population of gringos to marde.
québec city is a big yay. definitely a place to be in july during the feq. the place to party for sure. je t’aime québec.
thanks, but i must confess that i had shamelessly ripped the pics off wiki. i don't know who has upload them there.
september is a good time to pay a visit but be advised that it can get surprisingly hot and humid even late in the month.
weather here is cantankerous. winter is ok if you like skiing and such but it lasts a month too long imho. snowfall amounts vary wildly from one year to the next, from lows of 26 inches total for the season to nearly 100 inches. but some of it falls as rain making the area too unpredictable to host the winter olympics for example. qc is flanked to the east by the appalachian range, which shelters it from the uber 18-inch+ snowfalls  that bury esst coast us cities several times each winter. 
to the north lies the laurentian montains which hold arctic air at bay. because of this and its location well south of the 50'th paralell the city is far from being the coldest large city in canada. that honor belongs to edmonton, ab followed by winnipeg, mb, calgary, ab and st.john, nf.
but that being said qc is very humid which exacerbates both cold and heat. summers here are warm to hot, and ac is strongly recommended. between june and september temps above 80f are common but with the humudid air it feels more like 90f. fall and spring are short and temperate to cold.
it’s not cfl but you could get your fix with the rouge et or!
been living in qc since i was 21 (1984). was born and raised mainly in the us so had to learn french. managed to but still have horrible english accent apparently. being able to live here was worth the effort. no nfl but they have the best college football team in canada. nfl scouts here.
the alouettes??????
europe is sometimes like that, too.
yeah there's been a phenomenal growth in the number of immigrants settling in quebec city over the last 40 years or so. mainly latinos and africans. vietnamese and chinese as well. 
when i arrived here in the mid- 80's i couldn't help but notice it was like 95% white, just like in my little hometown of 30,000, most of them bearing french canadian names, located in maine near the borderline with new hampshire. the population of qc then was about 600,000 (a lot more now) and you just never see such proportions in other (north) american cities on the million threshold now.
there were some immigrants back then but they rarely stayed for long preferring montreal and toronto. as you know qc was mainly an administrative center and university/research/military town with little to offer to non-qualified workers, so they left.
but then in the early 90's qc saw an economic boom that's still rolling 30 years and counting. even the pandemic merely put in a tiny dent on car sales and that was it. 2008 recession? never heard of it here, buildings are sprouting out like mushrooms whole new neighborhoods have been constructed and he who says construction says jobs galore and that attracts immigrants to this city which enjoys the lowest unemployment rate in the country, employers literally run after people begging them to work for him/her. there are many immigrants who settle here now, and many enjoy nice income.
as for the housing aspect, rent for decent apartments has rocketed through the roof prompting a lot of owners of aging dwellings to proceed to "renovictions" chasing away current tenants, renovate to luxury rental condo style and triple the rent. it happens to gringos as well as blacks or asians. problem is that unlike say, toronto or chicago, there is no rent control board here. landlords can charge whatever the market will bear. for example starting in august i'll be renting  a 4-bedroom ranch house with 2 friends. rent is a whooping $3200 all utilities included along with brand-new kitchen appliances and a swimming pool/spa that we can't use thanks toa defunct pump and the landlord who lives in galveston tx is not of much help. and people consider this a bargain fer cris's sake.
yes, gringos we are when we travel to mexico and such. mexicans make no distinction whether you speak french or english as long as you're "anglo-saxon" (it engulfs a broad meaning to them), palefaces from "el norte" (usa or canada) are all gringos to most of them. it's not always an insult though, akin to french and english canadians using the term "latino" referring to south americans.
in my previous post when i said people from quebec are not latin i was referring the culture not the language. to me their culture includes strong celtic and anglo-saxon imprints, plus that little je-ne-sais-quoi, an endearing mentality found nowhere else. but they are most definitely north americans in every aspect save for the language.
that chateau... when i was a kid living in maine we often drove to quebec city because it's the nearest large city for people living in western maine and it is a shopper's dream with numerous very large shopping malls.
 about the chateau, my parents would tell us it was the real cinderella castle, that the one in disneyland (there was no disneyworld yet) was just a fake. we kids believed it because it's the stereotypycal fairy tale castle, albeit an enormous one, that thing is unusually huge! sometimes we'd go there at the coffee shop off the gargantuesque lobby where they sold ice cream. the sheer luxury of the lobby with its leather furniture, stately chandeliers, oakwood appointments, deep soft carpeting... we kids were totally impressed, we thought only royalty of the highest ranking, people like napoleon... and cinderella of course, could have lived there. we didn't realize that, even by old europe standards, the building was much larger than any versailles, louvres or buckingham palace. 
even when i realized it was "just" a hotel i continued to consider it the best-looking such establishment in america, and i still do. it's not just the building, the setting is also perfect, manages to hide the taller office towers that loom behind it, thanks to the chateau's 22-storey central tower thst was built in 1920 or so, while most of the hotel dates back to the 1870's or 80's.
 i read the national geographic magazine and they have plenty of articles about chateau frontenac or historical events that took place in it. few people know that roosevelt and churchill met there in 1943 to discuss the best way to invade german-occupied france. d-day was incepted between those stately walls and again the following year the two allied leaders returned to decide on the course of events now that normandy was rid of german troops. it was decided during that conference that the allies would not bomb paris: instead us forces would let  a french armored  division under a general leclerc enjoy the honor of liberating paris from the few german units that had not yet fled as the allies were fast approaching and mortar shells were raining near the city.
26 inches is 66.04 cm
what about french though? can i get jobs in english or spanish?
what he says :)
that's very admirable. maybe you're right, i should stop whining and learn french like everybody else.
they are 3 hours away from quebec city. they should make a team called les foques du quebec (quebec seals).
yeah there has been a lot of latinos coming to live here. my dad immigrated to quebec 15 years ago (2006) from dominican republic and there weren’t nearly as much people from latin america while now you encounter a lot of families that are first or second generation immigrants
there is a strong provincial rent control board... not only that but within the first month of residency you can apply to have the reduced to what it was for the previous tenant if it was raised above the prescribed rate. but if this is a vacation rental that might not apply.
[deleted]
yes indeed, sorry i should have included the metric figures as well in my post.
short term for sure, but longer term you’d feel the need to learn french as the city is very francophone.
while spoken french is mandatory in businesses, most people can speak decent english so you’d be understood. but don’t try to speak english to clients, some closed-minded people will shout at you for that because "tokébec icitte calass"
yes imho you could but french would eventually creep on to you without you noticing, and i mean "creeping" in a good sense. like almost all of the other english speakers i know -quite a lot- who moved here over the years all without exception now speak at least enough french to engage in any conversation held in that language
no. if you want to live in english or spanish, you can go anywhere on this continent. stop breaking our balls.
french is relatively easy to learn for english speakers
at least the vocabulary is since both languages have around 60% of their words in common. but pronunciation, that's the real challenge.  they pronounce their 'r" and 'u' the german way and try as i might i could never master those. :(
indeed and that gives the city a more cosmopolitan atmosphere that is most needed. before that it was like a gigantic country town for most of the last century, after the english, scots and irish had left in the 1880's and  ,90's. at one time in the mid-1800's the city was almost half english and half french. the area today known as montcalm was exclusively english-speaking as one can tell by the street names.
that is quite atypical though but to each their own i guess.
i live in mtl and i took a french course but i already forgot almost everything. i guess my only option would be to win the lotto max, and with that money i will be able to lobby the major of qc city in order to heavily enforce spanish in schools, make spanish the official language, and change all the signs to spanish. then by 2030, everybody will speak spanish and i will be able to communicate effectively ;)
this is what i get when i search the phrase you wrote there.
rofl they sure have a colorful language at times but they are not rude, like some people from france or the us can be. i am told it's one of several anglo-saxon traits of character inherited from long british rule. there is also their religion (seldom practiced anymore), a form of catholism fraught with protestant beliefs such as the soul entering the hereafter immediately after passing instead of waiting to be raised from the dead at the end of times, like practicing catholics throughout the world believe.
at this very moment, i'm on my way back from quebec city. a couple my wife and i know just moved to quebec city from montreal and we helped loading and unloading the truck. the guy is quebecois and his friends are quebecois as well. since i didn't want to feel like an outsider, i practiced my french with them as much as i could and it made me very happy.
i also speak spanish which is very close to french. but i live in montreal. everybody at work speak english and my life is in english so i haven't feel the need to become fluent in french. however, if i learn it, i will get better job opportunities, so there is that.
we don’t need people like you here. if you appreciated quebec for what it is, you would gladly learn our language instead of trying to destroy our culture. 
kindly,
stay in montreal
indeed i spent a few years in montreal and hardly ever used french because as soon as french speakers heard my thick english accent they would switch to english. but it's statistically true that people there who are fluent in both languages tend to be better educated and land the most coveted positions.
relax, it was a joke my friend. even if i stay in mtl i would still want to learn french. 
i already know some expressions: omelette ou fromage.
i'm surprised the other poster didn't notice the ovious fake sarcasm in your post ,,😄
btw i doubt anyone could convince mayor labeaume that the sky is blue let alone enforce spanish lol
the bitrate is fucking mongolian compared to what it should be, given the date.

water water water! merry christmas.
it always annoys me to hear opponents of public transit use the argument that it costs too much. when you point out to them that more than 10 times the amount has been invested in roads, and probably more than 20 times when you count absolutely all the public money spent on cars, then they are never concerned about these costs- there, it only confirms that the cost of the tc has absolutely nothing to do with their opposition.
my expectations are very, very low so i am pleasantly surprised.
also if we look at the development of the 3rd link, i have the impression that they are quietly preparing the ground for an announcement that will be a tunnel that will only have one metro.
if public transport is too expensive, we cannot afford roads.
it would be surprising if it was a metro only, but last i heard they were clearly talking about a fairly imposing public transport system (with a series of underground stations along the tunnel in lévis) using reserved lanes. maybe some kind of trambus.
it's that i'm not an expert but i have the impression that some things on rails are much cheaper than a tunnel with several tracks and which needs a service track in case of breakdown.
but as long as you dig ...
it's maintenance costs too
the maintenance costs of a 4-lane tunnel are not much more expensive than a 2-lane tunnel. good i am for a rail transport and some tracks because i use the car a lot and if there are only rails, i will not use the 3rd link.
until next time, my friend
the lunches at the antique dealer are good in a chalice, the little potatoes on the plate that cook all day long with little bits of half-burnt bacon in particular
it's nice, come back when you want.
thank you to you for your visit. i'm a bit surprised that you didn't had more english servers but at the same time, if it helped you, that's nice.
my absolute favourite breakfast experience in quebec city is au cochon dingue!
hi! i am living in qc for the month of september. i leave wednesday. what is the weather like right now? currently, i have packed sweaters but do i need more summer wear?
i've been all over the country and i have to say quebec city as one of the best cities. there are some amazing food establishment and always a lively crowd.
itll get cold fast after september tho
you'll need shorts during the day and sweaters at night.  most important, bring a rain jacket and umbrella.  september can be very rainy (even if we've had little to no rain recently so all the grass is dormant).
september is usually the best month for weather imo, itll be around 15-25
septembre starts off like summer and ends up like fall.
so good strong 20-25°c days at the start and then 10-15°c days by the end of the month.
last week was out of ordinary, heat wave late august aren't common. for september, it's generally 15-20c the day and at the end of the month, we can near 0 to 5c during the night.
will it be cold in september?
thank you! i am planning on packing my rain boots too!
this is all very helpful. thank you!
not under 15c
my pleasure, if you have any other questions, feel free to ask :)
thank you! i most certainly will. i am so excited to get to town on wednesday!
enjoy!
colors are off.
it’s from an [artist]( i know. yes it’s photoshopped but with good taste.
looks a bit too canadian to me.
yeah, it's obviously photoshopped
the photos taken during the pandemic, with few people / people in the streets sometimes give the impression of standing still.
beautiful pictures !
very beautiful pictures ! thanks for sharing
eille c beau en calisse
wow   .... stunning ..... 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
is there going to be a christmas village this december?
my pleasure:)
the more things go, the more i think about it, but questions about tourism often vary and evolve rapidly. information from last year may no longer apply today.
i tell the other mods, we will try what and potentially ask for contributions if it can work.
thanks / u / user_8804 for the post, that will prompt me to do it instead of just telling myself i was thinking about it!
very good idea! for restaurants it is possible to make shareable lists directly in google maps, it would be really good to have a pinned post with all the info
good idea 💡 💡 💡
i agree, good idea.
i agree! i think another should be created for people who are new to the city
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
i like the very colorful, almost naive style.
yes! she seems to have some wall sagging problems this one! but she is charming like all the others in st jean :)
it is very peaceful and pleasant to watch.
which village on the island?
thank you! you are so nice. i was inspired by many pieces from the montreal museum of fine arts. have a nice day!
haha. yes, they all have their own character. it is also a lovely place. thank you!
this is the spirit of the island. this is what i feel when i visit. something i hope to do again soon. thank you!
it's saint-jean on île d'orléans. thank you!
andré montmorency and montmorency falls have no more connection than patrick huard and the fall of the dollars.
explain my boyfriend haha
canadian tire!!!! canadian tireee!!!!  siiiickkk!!
it is true that the old man is very pretty, however when your friends try to visit you, parking is a nightmare (especially in winter).
it's not better in montreal / ontario. good luck finding free street parking in ontario.
there are like 56 underground parking lots in the old town, you just have to be resourceful and have a few dollars frankly
it depends which neighborhood!
what was your favorite restaurant and activities?
i have to agree it’s a great city. so much to explore.
pierrot in limoilou has amazing poutine, la pizz in place royale, old qc has delicious pizza and sangria, and is situated in the most adorable courtyard…just a short walk away from the st. lawrence river and petit champlain, my favourite place to explore 😊
glad you enjoyed my city. always interesting to know where people enjoyed themselves!
i've been saying it for years, pierrot has the best poutine in the world however if you think quebec is amazing, you should go to europe.
lol i was curious about that restaurant, and was wondering why i never heard of it.
went out on google with street view to look for it and i just couldn't find it!
turns out they moved like 2 months ago and the new address is on google maps but not street view, it's the old business.
took me way to much time to figure this out so i wrote this in case it helps someone lol
awe thank you! i have family who live there also, so i try to visit at least once a year 😊 🤗
it’s the squeaky cheese for me! and the “sausages” y’all put on them too 😂🤤
lol thank you! you’re the real mvp! 🍟 🥇
next time , hit nina pizza on st-anselme , my favorite pizzeria in quebec and both owners are incredible. they also have an ice cream comptoir with very very specials recipe.
not all the poutines have sausages. personally not a fan but to each his own
omg i will have to try it out! thanks for the recommendation 😊
i know lol that’s just the one i like to order, it’s basically just a fried hot dog, but so good 🤤 maybe i have cheap taste 😂
you had me at ‘’fuck andré arthur’’
i would tell you one of the reasons why cyclists are less reckless in quebec is that motorists are really more dangerous (towards pedestrians too). it is not safe for cyclists even on certain cycle paths, i do everything to avoid the one on 3avenue, i almost took 3 doors in the face to date, also a car has to decide to leave its parking lot in the street very quickly in front of me (on the cycle path). at a place to get to the job i should do a little bit of charest with the cars and the world are not paying attention, so i walk a block with my bike.
yes, we still have a beautiful cycling network, especially on the east-west axis. north-south it becomes more limited on the other hand.
it is really more suitable for hiking i find. if you have the opportunity to do the quebec-lévis circuit, i highly recommend it!
thank you! i prefer cycling in quebec city than in montreal. leaving the path along boulevard champlain, taking the ferry, and going to montmagny, it's wonderful.
as for the city bike, i still sweat every time i pass near the grand théâtre to take rue fraser - an intersection that seems made to favor blind spots. at the same time, i'm less afraid there than when i take an overpass at the corner of van horne and parc in montreal. next step: clear the snow a little bit :)
i am from montreal so since being in quebec i have really noticed that people here drive (not less well) but are less safe. the light next to my old apartment (intersection st-vallier ouest / charest). when the pedestrian light is green, motorists can continue to go straight. so there is a green arrow that goes straight ahead only. green signifies an obligation. it means you have to go straight. if you want to turn right, wait for the solid green light or a green arrow going right (i know it's supposed to be common knowledge but it looks like it isn't).
the number of times that i almost got hit on this intersection because i was crossing in my light and the motorists think that a green arrow which goes straight ahead means "you can do anything if you want my boyfriend" is amazing !!! once i was crossing and a driver braked sharply in front of me in anger. we persisted, but he was sure he had the right. (hey boy). from a moment i made a detour because it happened far too frequently.
now i live on the 4th in limoilou. people are driving really fast on the 4th. but at least we have "right of way" everywhere. quotation marks are important. do the world know what is a pedestrian passage priority in quebec ??? i swear i have to wait a long time to impose myself before a tank lets me pass!
in short, i love quebec and i don't regret having left montreal. however, i am afraid for the moment when i am going to have a child and he will walk or cycle in the city.
i have done montreal and quebec and i find that montreal is more suitable for cycling, but it's so full of people that it gets dangerous sometimes. in quebec city i find that cycling is good on the boulevard, there is not always an efficient cycle path to get you where you want. it's beautiful and there is less traffic. i haven't really had a problem, except sometimes to go up to the upper town you have to take detours if you don't want to climb too steep hills.
about dangerous motorists: i know i speak only for myself but if you see a cyclist in the middle of the street for (it seems) no reason it is always a defensive move either to be visible or to stand. keep an exit door on a road in poor condition. it is more difficult to understand when you are not riding a bicycle elsewhere than on cycle paths.
it was one of my hypotheses since quebec motorists cut buses in the same way that cyclists in montreal cut cars.
my other assumptions are:
- no bixi. if you own your own bike you probably ride it more often
- more cyclists know how to drive so they are aware of blind spots.
i am unable to recover from the summer when i had to borrow marie- de incarnation from wilfrid-hamel to climb on rené-levesque every day ...
the railway cycle path should be! cn refused to let the city plow that, but a guy from limoilou started doing it himself with a snowblower and cn said that the city could finally do it.
i can't wait to see how quickly they will do this.
hahaha, passing priorities make me laugh, i think they don't teach it in driving lessons in quebec. i sympathize. now i cross it even though the driver wouldn't let me pass. it forces them to brake and give way
the most visible place is to the left of the middle, directly in front of the driver. this place also makes it possible to occupy the space and not to be passed in its lane by the left. this is the place where motorcyclists are taught to ride.
unfortunately, many people on scooters tend to ride to the right of the middle where they are less visible and can get crowded into the lane on the right by cars. but since you can drive this without a lesson (just need a tank driver's license) their owners rarely know about it.
in my opinion, all of these factors come into play. we can also add the slopes and hills, as well as the weather: you have to be in better shape, or more motivated to get around by bike in quebec city than in montreal, that keeps * sunday cyclists * away, or it limits them. to designated cycle paths.
phew ... my sympathies
i do the same thing sometimes, i impose myself according to the speed, in order not to put my life on the line!
motorists who complain that cyclists are * in the middle of the street *, that's exactly the point: if cyclists stand there it is to be seen, therefore to avoid accidents. normally it is the last resort, after the dedicated track and the cycle lane (far from the doors of parked cars), but if there is none of that, in the center-left of the lane, it is the most safe.
there are several things we can do about this. in the long term, our road network must be reconfigured.
but in the short term i believe that a road sharing component should be added to the driving theory test. both to prove that we know what to do with heavyweights and featherweights.
and import the longueuil * swap your ticket * initiative and adapt it. basically if the longueuil police see reckless behavior on a bicycle they will give you a ticket but instead of paying it you can take their free bicycle safety course. here we should focus more on reckless behavior towards bicycles.
it could be good for everyone: motorists, cyclists, pedestrians, scooter or motorcycle riders.
the habitation was at the foot of cap diamant, but otherwise, very pretty!
wow !
thanks for sharing
that cross 😔
yes, or where notre-dame-des-victoires is located today.
yeah, unfortunately bill 21 wasn't in effect yet at that time...
sorry guys... i draw a cross to remember the 18 or 19 dudes who died during the first winter in quebec. btw, you're right, history teaches us nothing.
the size of the market probably only allows one business. they also probably deal with a lot of bad situations if they're an emergency vet clinic. 
i brought in a cat i found dying and they didn't charge me. i'm guessing that it's a question of high fixed costs and relatively small market. it sucks.
veterinary healthcare is private in quebec. 
daubiny serves as a good reminder why our public health system is important. they are competent, but fact is that healthcare is expensive.
[deleted]
very nice experience there. watch the distribution of the star on google, its 5 star or 1 star, almost no in-between.
there's only one option, probably because it's a real chaotic private (dogs in general) business with close to little help from the government. so no one wants to do it.
daubigny is overwhelmed because no one else is doing it.
and they'll continue to push the prices up in hopes to reduce the amount of people they get.
something else to keep in mind... the vets think they can do everything pets. it's weird because real doctors never claim they can do everything human. for instance, psychologists is a very different kind of doctor than a surgeon... well in the pet world, the vets claim that they own all of that. many organizations are trying to create an association of specialists for pet behavior, and they're being blocked by vets.
we're lagging behind in pet health. europe is the one we should try to mimic here.
you should check out lachapelle, they do their own emergencies but only for their regular clients (so go there for your vaccines, check ups, etc). not sure they take new clients is this covid period though.  hopital vétérinaire de lotbinière does small animal emergencies too, and for people that are not their clients (pre covid though, better check if it is still the case). both these places have less equipment than daubigny but will charge less. also, i heard through the grapevine that dmv (an emergency center already located in montreal) plans to come to qc city in the next year.
i know i had trouble with obedience lessons because of the language barrier. i went all the way to montreal to find an english dog trainer. it might be worth the two hour drive depending on the type of emergency your dog has
speak in tabarnak french?
there’s actually a lot of 24h pet hospital in québec l’ormière, saint-louis, moffet, globa vet, anima plus, cimon ect we have more than fifthy of them in what city are you talking about?
is the er very different from the specialists? i've been to see the cardiologist and internal medicine specialists there from new brunswick and, although expensive, they were worth every penny. my cat wasn't expected to make it a year, but because we saw the specialists and got a treatment plan in order, she is now on year 3. it's weird because on google there are some terrible reviews. :/
went there by night, they took 500$ out of my pocket and told me my dog was fine and it was its period. went home, morning later my wife woke up and found the dog in a blood pool making convulsion. went back and werent even sorry and ask us a other 500$ for another exam than told us the dog as to go under operation right know and ask another 3000$. went to another vet and they did the operation for 1000$      daubigny are fu@@ing assh@le only interested in how they can suck out of your bank account.
[deleted]
wait wait, there are emergency vets here and there in the "regions", but yeah it's emergency vets, it's not a complete emergency clinic, you gotta have vets on guard for anything farm related. plus, normally, for every veterinarian clinic, somebody should be on guard to answer the phone and provide help.
of course it's far from perfect ... but mentalities are evolving. recently laws have been adopted strengthening animal rights,with a couple steps in that direction, hopefully they'll get pressured to increase the coverage for emergency veterinarian clinics.
oh really? thank you a lot for the information. this is what i needed.
i went 1 year ago to dmv in montreal because my cat labor had stopped. may hundreds dollars later , we went back home to wait and see as recommended by the vet . i ask how much it would cost me if we need a c-section . it was 3000$ + . it is not a cheaper alternative. but the care were good .
what do you mean?
shut up. french is extremely difficult.
all of them you mentioned seem not 24h.
plus, if it was true that what you just said, people would’ve already pointed it out. but all of people in this post know which hospital i’m talking about.
that's what happens when you sell healthcare. you get to play with people's emotions to maximize profits. they also  have a monopoly for emergency veterinary care, and i doubt that'll ever change because the costs involved to open a competitor veterinary hospital would mean that new hospital would need to charge even more to be profitable.
at what cost ?
also,  if the emergency units were used as they were deisgned for by the pooulation, wait times would be much lower.
competition tend to lower the price. daubigny business model are about playing with emotion and monopoly, both, 3 000$ was for the operation under the normal business hour schedule, they would probably asked 2 the price at night.
we get it, all the problems with the healthcare system in qc is because of the population, it has nothing to do with wasted ressources and the huge bureaucracy. wait lists for operations, family doctors,  waiting at the emergency, it's all our fault. we must be really awful as a population because it doesn't happen elsewhere...
i meant the newcomer would probably have to be more expensive than daubigny in order to be profitable. 
the number of veterinary professionnals willing to work night shifts/being on call seems to be quite low too. they would want to make it worth their time.
a)it does happen elsewhere.
b)most problems regarding ressources availability could be avoided with a cultural approach that favors prevention instead of curation. it's not normal for a population to require so many cabg procedures per capita, for example. most of these people could never afford the 6 figures bill that comes with such a procedure, by the way.
b)when i see someone bitch at the emergency waiting rooms that they've been waiting there for "6 hours", then maybe their situation really isn't that emergent. we still have door to needle times between 15-30 minutes for acute mis or strokes, which is right on par with other highly regarded healthcare systems. i never had to wait more than 2 weeks for an appointment with my family doctor. when the situation was a bit more urgent, i went to the "sans-rendez vous" and waited 3 hours. not that bad for something that could've waited for a couple days more.
of course, if you hurt your ankle and require an x-ray for proper diagnostics (even though we know that it's most likely just a sprain from looking at it) and you show up at 20h30, when the radiology department is 1/3rd staffed maybe you'll wait after sever trauma cases, the acute pulmonary oedemas, the routine cardiac and thoracic surgery post-op chest x-rays, the elderly patient who fell on the geriatric floor and whom we suspect might have suffered a cranial or hip fracture, etc.
c)i will agree about the bureaucracy part, but that wouldn't change much. at best it would allow 200-ish more nps to practice throughout the province. and those 200 nps would mean 200 less floor  nurses. fact of the matter is that there just isn't enough people that want a healthcare career to meet the needs.
d)we are the ones that keep voting for governments that promise new bridges, wider highways and lower taxes at the expense of healthcare and education. spending 15 minutes less in traffic daily because you bought an unconviniently placed house (hey it was bigger and cheaper !) is much more important than the one time you spend 8 hours waiting in the er because youbhave a cough and couldn't be bothered wating 5 days to see your physician.
i am constantly fascinated by the inability of my compatriots to look at themselves in the mirror and to take everything as a personal attack. we will never improve as a people if we are devoid of any capacity for self-criticism. the only thing that awaits us with this "mindset" is the status quo of the
mediocrity.
have a nice day.
you could be right if they were in a cost plus business. but they are on a how much i can suck    your wallet model. that is the problem. i wouldnt mind paying an extra if is was legit. but my own experience with this clinic was feeling i was dealing with martin shkreli
"take it all as a personal attack. one will never improve as a people if one is devoid of any capacity for self-criticism."
says the nurse with a family doctor, who think half the population goes to the emergency for a cold or light sprain... please, do you know how much time i've been waiting on the list for a family doctor ? i would love to have person of trust, aware of my medical history, who i could give a call to answers some medical question...
it's not because you're frustrated with your er being full of people waiting for something totally not urgent like a cold (hey i get the feeling, total waste of money), that automatically everybody does the same. especially the part of the population with a family doctor, between calling your doctor or going to the er, waiting how much time, to be given the same kind of answer, pretty sure they would choose otherwise given the choice.
for decades, quebecers have voted for the political party that promises to improve the health system .... not for wider roads ... you don't have to be from the area to say that. we could ask labaume to invest its big 5 billion tramway (the most expensive in the world per kilometer) in health, it would do good instead of a means of public transport that nobody wanted even before the pandemic.
i understand your situation, for my part i let go, i will see my friends whether or not they respect the sanitary measures, but i will make sure to respect them when i go to see them.
i sliced the pear in half
i understand you, for my part it's mostly family members who have been breaking the rules all the last year.
it's a clash of values, but now that we are deconfining i am relearning to rub shoulders with them, i put aside the animosity. in my case, since it's family, it's impossible to burn bridges.
same :(
hm yes it is a good moral consideration to judge your environment. if i was really hungry, i could eat a raw dog to survive ... but when you are really hungry, the moral is low.
good advice? no idea.
looks like you're making a problem for yourself.
i don't see the problem if you are vaccinated.
yes, i was doing the same. i was holding my two meters. now that we've all been vaccinated for 4 weeks with a dose, i think i'll be more relaxed though.
i understand.
i was telling myself that too, and we tried to reconnect recently, but they annoy me when they say that they go and have been at parties, or that their entourage has caught the covid but that it does not matter. and they find me boring because i really care.
with family it's often a clash of values, and not just about covid, right? ;)
i think you're not in the right place ...
he didn't shop around for that feeling on his own. i understand op.
[deleted]
i see no problem with your french.
i realize i'm lucky the few friends i love to see them are paying attention. my entourage seems to take everything really seriously so i forget that in quebec we have pockets, but hey, there are everywhere.
ho if you knew
blaming your friends who are (i guess here) young for the pandemic that "never ends" is completely foolish.
no need to be 100% protected. after 3 weeks of the first dose the risk of complications is equivalent to choking on a hot dog. opinion ofc.
so much the better! because let's say it was not the right year to renew those around you.
but at least it encourages me to know that there are other people who are taking the situation seriously.
did they say that? i think you said that.
yeah, this just in,
that's you, saying that, no one else in this thread.
so yea, stupid assumptions are totally stupid, agreed.
... is because the risk of complications from choking on a hotdog, it's not bad just death ...
there are a lot of people in their 70s who use reddit, that's a real good point!
a perfect death on the other hand.
i like hot dogs.
/s
shit, i can no longer lie to tourists by inventing stories about the ball.
from another article: "on march 18, the trunk and its cannonball (which is in fact an inactivated bomb) will be removed in the presence of the canadian armed forces."
it's still funny that part there
:(
they could keep the bottom part.
nonnnnnnnnnnn
very ironic
they think they will do it: taken from another article "the trunk and the metal object will be preserved to make a public work of art. the population will have a say since there will be mediation workshops in the presence of artist paryse martin "
i hope they can recreate a bronze tree trunk and reincorporate the ball and put the work back in the same place. elm and fetlock have an aesthetic quality in themselves
some good news!
50% of the top 10 come from the last 9 years.
it's sad how quickly we go into the wall
people here are really happy to see this news, very immature
fantastic!
we're going din tropic bro not in the wall. fuck yeah!
interesting! and very ironic, after also having registered the hottest temperature ever in the same month!
hi rolf! i recently moved from ottawa to qc. nice to see that you are producing/publishing data for quebec city. thanks!
amazing ! i've seen your promo video on ig, it's really good 👌
is drone shooting your specialty?
i like landscape videos like that!
would be a million times better during the summer instead of a trash ass winter time 😭😭😭
unfortunately, it’s misleading. it’s a very racist & xenophobic place. speaking something other than french will get you in trouble. the only time your safe from the québécois nazis that live in the capital is during high tourist season; they won’t say no to your money but don’t stay too long...
appreciate it ! thank you!
partially. also photography and promotional videos with camera. but the drone videos are very cool.
soon!
i'm sorry you did not have a positive experience but i can't agree with your comment.
you don’t need to. as a non white 30+ years resident of quebec, i’m letting you know about the reality of the capital

when the daycare starts in 5 minutes, it's time to deny it!
the number of times i have missed getting hit in quebec (including the times i was crossing on a red with the pedestrian guy on), i wait until the tanks are far away before crossing any street. . i work in old quebec and the more people i see driving crookedly and going one way in the opposite direction, the happier i am not having to rack my brains and take the bus.
it has already happened that my boyfriend and i have been cycling on the sidewalk along a boulevard because of the tanks driving madly and that a guy yells at us from his pick-up saying "a bike that's going to go on the trottoir »no shit sherlock, but you drive badly and it doesn't tempt me to die in the morning.
i moved from montreal to quebec city 5 years ago and i find that there is less aggression in quebec city, but people heat really less well, that is to say in general they have no situational awareness, half of the people drive in the left lane, every day priorities are not met at stops, etc.
quebec is full of "stroads"
[
yes indeed, even worse in the northern suburbs of the city. to get to the city i have the choice between 45-50 minutes by bus or 15 minutes by car. i invested in a hybrid to have a little better conscience. each time i see questionable behavior on the road. again on this saturday morning a tank decided to turn left on its flashing green step while 2 cars in the opposite direction almost crashed into it.
totally agree that urban development has been too focused on the automobile. in my opinion if we end with a 3rd link it should be for mass transport only. the city is hostile to anything other than an automobile, even more so in the winter when the kinds of cones flats that mark the curb bike lanes are removed. motorists are burnt by the minority of tour de france cyclists who ride in the street just next to the bike path, so they oppose any investment for cyclists justifying "they use it mm not, why we should pay ".
quebec is built around the car, for the car by people who love cars.
if you stay between le revenu and downtown, the car is not necessary, the 800 routes are frequent. ditto if you stay alongside henry bourrassa or in le bourgneuf. other than that, it will depend on your patience.
it takes a lot of courage and caution for a pedestrian wanting to cross a street. the only exception: on salaberry, in front of the le saint patrick seniors' residence, a super showy and safe crossing, let's say, because vulnerable customers. ideally, this kind of system should be installed throughout the city.
this is one of the reasons why i don't like quebec (i've been living there since september). i have hiking shoes and a bus pass. no bike, no communauto, no car. i have lived in several cities (in quebec and in europe) and cities significantly smaller than quebec. i have rarely been so disappointed.
it is a "chariot city" where pedestrian safety is sometimes questionable and has an awful supply of public transport.
when you stay in your arrondissement, it's average and if you have to get out it's awful. i live close to laval university: from my home to bulk barn (6 kilometers), by car, it takes 11 minutes, it takes 45 minutes by bus (and three buses) and 1 hour 45 minutes of walking (during which we do not cross any green area). the train station (5 kilometers)? 45 minutes by bus (which runs every 90 minutes - don't miss it, and you have a transfer), 1:05 walk ... we get along, i don't expect that i will be able to get there in 10 minutes and i just take a bus. i choose active transport with full knowledge of the facts. but screech that it pisses me off that it's still like two hours of commuting to get you not so far.
there are places to walk that it is sincerely dangerous - on the route of the bulk barn precisely for a while you find yourself walking on a cycle path just marked on the ground (no demarcation) between a service road and a motorway . short on the service road to cross because there is no stop sign.
worse i literally saw, on a heavy rainy day some drivers see me walking on the sidewalk with my backpack weighing down on the fungus and stuck to the sidewalk to purposely water me down (i mean he made a change of lane before to get closer to pedestrians and after having watered us). i deeply hate the experience.
i echo the attitude behind the wheel. it really is a matter of habit. in montreal, drivers know that pedestrians and bicycles are everywhere, you have to know how to share the road. in quebec this idea is absent, especially when it is less than 10 degrees. i make myself look funny looking like it's crazy to be on my bike not in spandex or in june.
note, with electric bicycles, the practice is democratizing and people have voted in favor of improvements in this area. i think it should get better over the years. i hope to be able to say in 5-10 years that we have really started a culture change. certainly in the central districts of quebec in any case.
i started cycling as my main means of getting around last spring. not a week has gone by without a driver honking me afterwards or yelling nonsense at me. it's truly heartbreaking, the sense of supremacy some drivers - often alone in big, empty, clean f-150s - feel entitled to.
my brother who has lived in montreal for 10 years, every time he comes to quebec i tell him to avoid rush hour otherwise he will ruin his life. as in fact every time he answers me "let's see then in montreal it's much worse and there is work going on all the time.
each time he arrives at my place, crowning like a lumberjack after the "ostis of backward drivers from quebec."
it's not as if i don't warn him every time ... / shrug
being a pedestrian or a cyclist in quebec is very dangerous, the tanks own the street. anything that slows them down or worse yet stops them is an enemy to take down the other tanks included. i would love to see a shoot at an orange line crosswalk that counts how many tanks don't stop for extra speeding pedestrians.
of course i do not put everyone in the same basket: we only notice delinquents but the behavior of several motorists is simply unacceptable.
yes quebec is a city of chariot where you wait 40% longer (compared to mtl) for your pedestrian light to pass.
yes when i am a pedestrian i look over my shoulder before committing myself to make sure that i will not be hit by a car ... when i normally have right of way.
yes, i often have my pedestrian lane cut off and i have to walk in the street to get around a car that blocks the direct access to the sidewalk.
yes, the speed limit now set at 30km in the residential area where i live (st-roch district) is only rarely respected.
yes, the police are very lax and do not intervene more or less with regard to all of these offenses provided for in the highway safety code.
having lived and traveled in other provinces of canada, we stand out for the low consideration of safety rules: it is only in quebec that the yellow light means "clanche!" and that vulnerable users are 2nd level citizens.
unfortunately, coercion at its limits ... but not selfishness.
[deleted]
yes i learned pretty quickly to have to wait a few seconds before crossing even with a pedestrian light on a red ... the big neon orange jeep that looked like a pumpkin didn't matter to him i think below his tank.
and i am guilty too. i had never been on a sidewalk on a bicycle, i found it a sacrilege ... before arriving here. 2-3 times i just didn't have a choice in terms of security.
i can not answer honestly here i will be negotiated endlessly.
but let's say that as a pedestrian, i'm not afraid of a tank, and if i have to cross, i'll cross lol
\ ^ \ ^ there you go. they are not aggressive, just oblivious.
source: former resident of both cities who loves quebec except for travel.
i know what video this is without clicking on it. i had a eureka with this stuff. you know when you ignore the word, it's hard to place the concept. the word stroad and the explanation, my outlook on hamel, boulevard sainte-anne has changed.
wow, see that i had never seen neither this video, nor this channel. i have for a few hours to look at everything but my god. revelation. also, i love canada, i love living in quebec in french but i miss europe too much watching that.
i save this comment because it describes so simply that i think too.
i live in the corner of the university also without a car and it is really manageable, i am still surprised by your experience. i recommend you go to the harvest on cartier rather than the bulk barn, a nice little ride of 800/801/807! :)
you are part of the problem then, having a bicycle does not mean no longer respecting the rules of the road, the lights are not for dogs but for road users. do you ride on the road? you are a user of the road and you are subject to its code.
lol my colleague told me the same thing, he told me "if you have to cross, you cross and the tanks will not have the choice to stop". but frankly after getting on the tank of my friends who are yelling at other drivers who are angry every 5 minutes, i don't trust people who are frustrated behind the wheel so much.
yes, i had the same reaction when i saw it for the first time. it is really intimidating to cross a stroad on foot.
grass is alway greener :). but yeah cities in europe are generally more pleasant to walk.
these are the prices that justify my decision to favor bulk barn rather than harvest. many of my frequent purchases are twice as expensive at this store as at bulk barn. the lack of green space in sainte-foy has a lot to do with it. this is the first time in six moves that to get to a park where i can walk, i have to walk 45 minutes.
hi!
my partner (33) and i (31) live in beauport with our 11 month old boy 😊. i work for the government and my partner works in the video game industry. i come from trois-rivières and my boyfriend from beauce, i would be very happy to have friends "in town", and even better with a child of the same age!
welcome to quebec!
hi! i am 31 years old and my partner is 30. i have a 5 year old daughter. we are near lebourgneuf and we really like friends' evenings with wine and beer. but above all, i go out of my comfort zone by responding to your ad haha !!
good neighborhood for family life. i suggest you bond with your colleagues as well as with the families of your children's friends.
do you like board games? there are several groups of players in quebec and it forges links quickly. if you do not know modern games, i suggest you spend an evening at la revanche (on charest, but 2 branches will soon open near the galleries of the capital and in beauport), at the joker (lévis) or at the future randolph (on submit to vanier, near the fleur de lys shopping center).
i heard on the radio this week. that employers were looking for a lot in it.
greetings and welcome to our beautiful city. we are 37 and 34 years old with 5 children from 2 to 13 years old, from beauport! come and have a chat, it will make me happy to get to know each other.
hi. i am belgian (here since 2010) and my wife is from quebec, we both work in it, we live 5 minutes from costco lebourgneuf. we are ten years older than you, but hey, that's okay, we're nice anyway 😁
if you need advice or other info, don't hesitate. it will please me.
and if you're looking for a job in it, my employer has hundreds of openings.
i answer everyone here, it will be easier! it would be downright cool to set up a meet and greet with everyone here on reddit who responded to my word! 😁
hi ! my partner and i live in beauport and we have an 8 month old friend, but no children yet;) we are both 29 years old and new meetings and possibly new, caring and pleasant friendships are our current goal !! we also like wine and less beer for me hihi.
[deleted]
it would be very cool to meet, the children are quite close in age indeed. if you want to send me a mp, we can exchange more easily and give you my coordinates
thank you!
ahaha yes i understand, i admit it's the same for me, it's not easy to meet people in a new country, especially when you're introverted \ ^ \ ^ it would be very cool to meet anyway. if you want to send me a mp, we can exchange more easily and give you my coordinates
this is one of the best things i have seen. my ex-wife, who moved here on her own from another country, made a lot of friends with the parents of our children.
edit: syntax
thanks for the advice :)
hi! thanks for the advice. we like board games, after we never had a game night, but why not! we will take a closer look :)
grooooossse shortage of manpower, on the scale of the planet. it's completely crazy right now.
yes, my wife in health is also in the same situation as me, shortage of manpower ... moreover, quebec released a few months ago, two simplified immigration programs for it and health
hi ! thank you for your word, i'm sending you a mp
what the..
i think you interpret the term "introduction" in a way that is a little too literal.
indeed, i have the impression that it is much cooler and easier than in france
in industrialized and aging countries, yes.
for quick mexican food in quebec, don't shit and go to quesada.
my best mexican-style restaurant in quebec:
restaurant la salsa
(418) 522-0032
i also suggest the mexican restaurant jalisco in limoilou! really excellent tacos!
jalisco tacos & drinks
if you liked the station tartare, go try the san ogari a little further away, it's incredible bowl (chirashi) pole with "local" ingredients or at least that advocates sustainable development
thank you for your sacrifice.
why is le 3 amigos just in montreal? i went last week it was really good
it has lot of negative reviews on google but maintains a 3.9 rating. sounds awful!
thank you
i find it so uncomfortable basing a business on reddit. google reviews, their facebook page, the manager on site when eating it could have done the job too i think.
in mexican restaurants there is the grocery store / restaurant [le mexicain] ( in charlesbourg, not too far from limoilou, run by a mexican family.
1000 rue de l'oise, quebec, g1h 2n4
i also like [señor sombrero] ( in beauport
732 avenue royale quebec, qc. g1e 1z4
deux22 no worse pentoute
in my opinion quesada c not so better but there are not too many options in quebec for the mexican buffet: s
i went once to quesada, a horror in the plate according to our experience ...
it's true that it's good there i agree
yes. i live next door. it's great, on the other hand they don't deliver and unless you take it as a takeout, it's really long as a service
it is salvadorian, but it is indeed excellent.
wow! i, who are always looking for some in that corner, had never seen. thank you!
yeah at the pyramid it's ogari san or centrale bergham, the rest is to be avoided.
what the fuck y'en a 30 seconds walk from my house, i'll try then!
shit yeah bein, i think it's nice because the ingredients are really cool and there are good mixes, but there are things that i like less like the fact that you have to take 3 tacos the same, there is no 1/1/1 option even if you can pay more
jalisco tacos on 1st avenue in limoilou is really good. but it is sure that it is far from ste-foy ..
weird, every time i went to him on avenue st-david i was very satisfied.
yes you are right indeed for the slowness of the service.
but it's worth the wait imho :)
salvadoran-mexican fusion cuisine :)
bah the victor is excellent the fried is ok and the sushi x makes a lot of sense too.
i never tried the bergham power station, i will try it next time i go
yes, the tacos were better anyway. on the other hand the pozole and the birria were excellent, as in mexico: 3
yes excellent choice, best tacos in quebec.
the soups are very good indeed!
as someone air bnb-ing this summer, in saddened by the lack of air conditioning here. still enjoying this beautiful city but not todayyyy
i wish him a very well deserved rest.
shit !!! big news anyway! gosselin must be happy.
i am curious to see who could replace him as leader of his party?
too bad he did a lot for quebec
gosselin has competition. bruno marchand (strong and proud quebec), jean rousseau (démocratie quebec), jackie smith (transition quebec) and the citizen alliance of quebec (a hay spit party that never won more than 1% of the votes).
and there may be even more suitors now that the king is gone.
gosselin, he's not the most thawed pogo in the box. he must still be digesting the information ...
the party is called team labeaume, not sure if he will survive his departure 😄
honestly, i didn't follow much the municipal politics of quebec other than regis it's only been 1 year and a half since i came back. i can't wait to follow the mayoral race because the municipal is what touches us the most.
i don't know much about the others, but i can't wait to get a hold of it.
the more i think about it, how is he going to build his platform if he can't just say the opposite of regis?
as long as there is a bus shelter or a tree in quebec that has not been transformed into a parking lot, mr. gosselin will have enough to write an electoral platform.
this is a really good question !!
i found his electoral program: 
in addition to being practical, i hope they will make it beautiful so that our beautiful city is picturesque with ti-train! nice!
i wonder what percentage of the population is going to use it? 🤔
waste, for the same price they could have bought a bus for each citizen and when they have finished their ti train, bin the suburbs will always be as badly served by buses which pass by the hours, when it is not the 2 hours in streets full of holes.
it is not exceptional in the models, but it has a certain elegance
you don't need everyone to use it for there to be a positive externality for everyone.
the people who are in the streetcar have fewer cars on the roads, so less traffic and less pollution.
the tram takes the place of 6 or 7 ford f150s. at 1.2 people per f150, that's less than 10 people. what percentage of the population is that?
we should not speak of% of population, but of volume of transport.
and for the same price that everything that was spent on cars would have a 6-line metro that would go to charlevoix ... i don't see what your argument is.
the suburbs will be served by high-frequency metrobuses which will link with the tram. the tram is the backbone of the structuring network, but not the only component. it could be extended in future phases too.
it's easier to connect the suburbs with a tram that better serves the major poles. for example in cap-rouge, the buses will only have connected the suburbs with the tram instead of connected them with the university.
a bit like the mtl metro, which has only one stop in longueuil, helps the entire south shore to get to the city center.
too bad that some people vote down the opposite opinion of theirs. i agree with you, the tram doesn't even go through beauport. i'll keep my car.
it's true that i would have put more color but i don't think the design is final in the models, right?
yep, pi fuck the price. not part of the equation.
it's simple, however, we don't need a train in the best-served sector of the city, we need more buses in the suburbs. even bus stops in charlevoix would make more sense than a train in downtown quebec.
even if my house was in front of a streetcar stop i wouldn't sell my car. it is a false debate. you can go to work by tram and to the grocery store by car!
no i think there were two options but the two look the same as i remember. very dark i find.
indeed it is important to make a comparison in relation to the cost. on the other hand, a cost-benefit analysis of this kind of project is quite complex. i won't pretend to be an expert.
on the other hand, i am studying economics and what i know is that in a period of recession like now, the best way to get back to growth is to spend massive amounts of money on infrastructure. during the crisis the bank of canada printed 600 billion new money which mainly has to support the values of the houses. and i am not including the deficits that the various levels of government are making. this money was used to support the values of people who had assets (stocks, real estate, business etc ...)
so what will remain with the younger generation? overpriced houses, but also, at least a tram.
i also invite you to go see the price of the car for the company.
do you want us to calculate how much the mtq costs for each motorist per year? quite certain that it is cheaper by public transport and that we prioritize investments for cars in town just out of habit or to please the acquired rights of motorists.
no. we need both. if we block one of the two by saying that we no longer need the other, we shoot each other in the foot. and meanwhile, another billion is spent on a highway with utter indifference.
effectively too dark!
yes in an ideal world it would be perfect to have everything but we don't have a cent and the need for transport in quebec at the moment it is not in the city center, it is in the suburbs and could be settled for a fraction of the price from the tram.
> but we don't have a cent
no. the federal and provincial governments have released funds specifically for that. if quebec does not do it, another city will have the funds or no one.
> the need for transport in quebec at the moment is not in the city center, it is in the suburbs and could be paid for at a fraction of the price of the tram.
no and no. before the pandemic, the métrobuses were crowded and in a single file on rené-lévesques during rush hour. the system will saturate in a maximum of 3 to 5 years if nothing is done. also, to have a chance to improve ct in the suburbs, you have to improve everywhere. and the full plan calls for improvements to buses throughout quebec city. finally, it is completely ridiculous to hope for a public transport offer at the same frequency and as widespread in the suburbs as in the city center. there just isn't the population to justify it. also it has been between 10 and 15 years that experts in town planning, land management and organization and transport planning have been studying the question and they have almost all come to the conclusion that a project similar to the one presented is ideal.
that doesn't lie, that ...
damn it is teak the rain at christmas! i don't want to see my grass!
i would have preferred a little snowfall like at the start of the week ...
thanks for the graphic!
yeeee from the rain!
how many years before we break the record? 3-5 years seems a reasonable guess.
he seems to be better established in the game than in real life!
is this a recreation of quebec city?
this doesn't look like my city at all.
i don't think so... i believe the building was part of a workshop on steam
i'm looking to go to qc in november and just started following the sub, i appreciate the recommendation!!! thx
good choice of restaurant! le légende is one of the best restaurants in quebec city
thanks man been living here for 8 years and first time hearing of it will definitely try it! nice to see americans enjoying our city so much.
i will! i also made one at restaurant tanière³
seemed to have good reviews and a unique experience
has anyone been there?
thanks for coming, and don't take this the wrong way, but... this is the city most of the people on this sub live in lol we already know the great places to eat at ahah
you bet!  as soon as you solidify your dates, make a reservation. you’ll be really glad that you did😁
it really was superb!
you bet 💯
oh man that looks amazing!  i wanted to go there but it was booked!  hey if you can, get a table by the window (at legende par la tanière).  another fun night i’d recommend is doing some bar hopping at st roch. you could start at macfly and work your way down, hitting some bars on the way and ending with japanese dinner at hono izamaya.
> restaurant tanière³
it's one of the best restaurant i've ever been, and i have been around quite a lot! ;-)
well, i was wondering if la légende would be where i would take my wife for our wedding anniversary and i am happy to read that a fellow foodie recommends the place, even if i live 1 km from the place. :)  thanks!
i’m a tourist coming on the weekend of the 30th, i’m looking at this sub for recommendations, so this was helpful to me!
amazing thank you!!! i'm planning on proposing the weekend of nov 13th there. we are staying at the fairmont. trying to get a bunch of ideas so we can celebrate. thank you kindly!!!
welcome 👍🏻
lucky he was there! what would you have done without him!
nice! trick or treating in québec? 👀
one thing i might consider. i ended up at place royals at about 1 am. it was beautifully lit, and we had it all to ourselves (unfortunately i was there with a a friend so it was nothing romantic)—but i’d imagine it sure could have been!  look up “place royale” at night. other things you can do is a tour of the plains of abraham and also drive to the ile d’orleans (just a quick trip
over the bridge). there are a bunch of wineries (but several may be closed in november, so call ahead). if also recommend a trip to the montmorency falls, which are super close.  worst case, you’ll see the falls from the car on your ride back from the island. one other thing, if you’re so inclined, you could take an afternoon trip up to st anne de beaupree basillica—its absolutely beautiful. 
okay a couple more things—check out bar sam at the cheateau (perhaps see if they take reservations. a very romantic place to have drinks). finally, the “grand allée” connects just outside the old city, and it’s a fun walk to some neat and hip bars and restaurants. 
i seriously love this city—feel free to ask me anything ya want!
you bet!
you are the best thank you so much! i'm building my plan over the next couple weeks and appreciate your offer to help with questions! any recommendations are greatly appreciated as i was really stumped on what to do!
about place royale at night, it's where they shot one of the last scenes of catch me if you can, when franck abagnale (dicaprio) is arrested in mont-richard, france. it looks exactly like in the movie. there are pictures of steven spielberg (and many others) at the château frontenac, where he stayed when they were shooting that scene.
keep me posted!!  i’d really
love to help. make sure you get dinner reservations tho asap (if you haven’t already).
very cool!!  i wasn’t aware of that.
>you are the best thank you so much! i'm building my plan over the next couple weeks and appreciate your offer to help with questions! any recommendations are greatly appreciated as i was really stumped on what to do!
wow, op, if i were the tourism office, i would hire you as an ambassador!  
you made some great and off-the-beaten-track choices: macfly, hono izamaya... i am curious, where else did you go? tourists rarely comes to st.roch but the food scene is amazing.
thank you!!  it’s a job i’ll certainly accept 😄. i’ve traveled to a lot of places, but qc will always be one of my favorite. i hope you all realize how lucky you are to live there. it’s so interesting to me how it’s a slice of europe just a short drive away from new england. 
i also love traveling places and making my own itineraries. i’ve been to qc enough times that i’ve spoken with locals and gotten some good suggestions. 
unfortunately i haven’t eaten at too many other places outside of the old city (i’ve only recently become more of a foodie). i’ve tried getting reservations before at l’affaire est ketchup, but haven’t had any luck. is there a restaurant that you’d recommend for my next trip?  😁
l'affaire est ketchup's owners have some other restaurants in town worth looking for (albacore for fish, kraken is an oyster bar, patante et machin which was amazing before the pandemic). it is hard currently for some restaurants, some  might not make it, let me know next time you are in town.
sounds great and will do 👍🏻
i actually know!
the national fine arts museum (mnbaq) put together two paths in the city. one about public art, the other about heritage/history. check out with the mnbaq for details! they have a booklet available for visitors to follow the path and discover art pieces of historical monuments on each paths. i’m simplifying but that’s the idea.
yellow line for dog owner to follow
green line for dog
it may be linked to this event 
sorry for the typo in the title. i was walking along avenue cartier and noticed the area has those colored lines... does that have any meaning? or just some art intervention?
thank you!
lol i was actually thinking if single line was for pedestrians and double lines for cyclists
thank you!
ive never seen them lmao. im also curious now.
i want to see our bus stop on the final, and nothing less. we wake up, people!
it's been a long time since i've been so committed to a common cause.
vote!
i just voted! we win hands down! ✋
did you also vote for wilfred?
i don't need to pretend
that is not a tourtiere, it’s a meat pie.
is ax throwing really popular?
sugar tartine ... wouldn't that be rather sugar tart?
so a nice article on how to pretend to be in quebec and interview montreal restauranteurs.
well done for the article ...
do not.
unless we're talking about a slice of map'o spread bread!
seemed to me too!
it's a cool activity to do. but nothing that is really in vogue.
hi! for the french the more you know is the best. but people are very forgiving if they have the feeling you’re trying your best. they’ll switch to english if they are able to. i don’t know in which domain you’ll be working but if it’s a professional job, you should not have a problem. but be ready to learn french and follow some course if you want to stay on the long term.
never been to toronto, but it’s a calm city. it’s a mix between a big city and a small town, you’ll find everything you need without the big traffic and the big problem. but there’s less thing to do than in montréal. condo and house are really cheap.
it’s only bus for now. they will build a tramway in the next few year. you can live without a car if you live downtown or in the upper city. after that it’s possible but with more trouble.
i don’t think you’ll have any problem regarding your race or religion. people expect that you keep the religion at home and most of québec is atheist.
assalam aleikoum brother,
* you will learn french quite fast if you practice while living in ville de québec.  considering what you wrote in french, i'd say most people will understand you. i don't think there are many people who don't speak english at all but i might be wrong, and even then, i found a lot of helpful people here in quebec-city, so you shouldn't be worried about that.
* life in quebec comparatively to toronto or montreal is less stressful and less crowded. there are a lot of stuff to do, depending on your hobbies. quick access to nature, lot of historic spots etc.
* as others stated, there are only buses for now. most parts of "downtown" and the closest suburbs are connected through routes that have a lot of buses (every 10-15min during rush hour). some other remote parts have one bus every hour or so, so it will depends where you work or where you want to go. might be helpful to choose where you live depending on that if you don't plan to have a car. you can check [the official website]( for more informations. also the city is trying its best to improve the bicycle lanes. and there are more and more people using this way to move around the city. 
only problem is between "la haute-ville" and "la basse-ville" which has a great difference in altitude so climbing up with a regular bicycle requires some strong legs.
* as for the muslim life in quebec city, we have 3 mosques and quite some places to buy halal food. *(you should definitely try the french tacos at épicerie quatre-bourgeois, in sainte-foy, if you like cheese)* i have zero issue since i live here and i'm arabic. but there are some racism, just like every places. i know friends who had less luck than me in their encounters but i wouldn't say you need to worry about it. people here are quite respectful and it should go both ways.
you will surely be able to get by already with your level of french, but if you want to meet people / socialize well you will probably have to study to get to an intermediate / advanced level - immersion will help you a lot :)
life compared to toronto (or any metropolis) is much quieter. me i come from a city of 2m inhabitants and in quebec it is not at all the same thing in terms of "nightlife" for example, but if you like to play sport, to benefit from the life in contact with the nature, without too much rush you will like it here :)
there are several choices of bus lines (especially 800/801/804/807), try to live close to these stops, but otherwise i would recommend buying a car - especially for the winter.
\ * that's a perspective from an immigrant who has also lived in quebec for a little over 2 years
hi my friend,
your french is already excellent. of course, to have a good quality of life in quebec and not to feel limited, you have to speak french.
i don't know toronto, but life here is relaxed, the traffic is not very intense and the people are friendly and welcoming. curious too.
public transportation works well with buses, for the quebec city & lévis region. but eventually, you might want a car to feel free to go elsewhere.
my wife is south asian and has no problem fitting in, making friends, getting a good job. in 4 years, no comments or mischievous, racist or even inappropriate looks ... and even, we are in rural areas.
the worst she's ever had is being greeted in spanish by people who assume she's from south america ...
as for religion, most quebecers have no interest in religion, catholic, muslim or otherwise.
i would even say that i notice a slight hatred of religion in general in my entourage ... which is based on the oppressive role of the catholic church in the history of quebec
i think your french would be fine and you’d get better at it much quicker in quebec city than in montreal. 
life is great here, but i’ve never lived in toronto and can’t compare ;)
yes, it’s only the busses here. i personally don’t have a car, which i’ve managed through living near a 807 (800 and 801 are even better if you can find something there - of course it depends where your job is) and making sure i’m walking distance from the grocery store. 
there is racism in quebec city of course, but i don’t think it’s much different from montreal or toronto. i live in a part of the city that’s pretty diverse. it’s definitely more multicultural than it was a decade or two ago.
1. your french is fine, no worries there. you'll learn faster in qc city than in mtl but it's not mandatory, moreover if you live in downtown. 
2. never lived at toronto but went quite a few times. qc city will definitely feels like a small town for you but it's also less violent and less stressful. housing is waaay cheaper here too. you can have a regular home for 300-400k if you are ok to get a car to move around. 
3. only buses. you need a car only if you want to live outside the city otherwise metrobus are fine 80x.
4. nah, canadian news about bill 21 are overrated, no one cares about that around here. the city is way more multicultural than it was 20 years ago.
there's free french classes offered by the government if you are looking into improving your french. i got to a b2 level before moving here, generally speaking it should be enough to get by. and i find that people here are really really nice when you make an effort to speak in french! 
i lived in toronto for a bit, and life in quebec city is really less stressful financial-wise. i can be with or without a partner living in quebec city and still afford a 1 bedroom apartment on my own. in toronto, the price of a room is already 1200.... not to mention the bidding wars for a room rental ( i wouldnt be able to afford 1 br)... of course much much less variety food wise compared to toronto, much less entertainment. 
u can get by without car but maybe live in downtown or stefoy? buses are mostly punctual. but also i realise car insurance here work differently. you can be quoted high insurance if u live in  markham or brampton ... but so far my insurance is about 50 to 60..
welcome to quebec!
having lived in calgary and ottawa for several years before recently moving back to québec city, i wanted to add a few things.
imo, for a city of its size, québec can be a pretty exciting place, especially compared with places in the gta. decent nightlife, a good arts and culture scene and great outdoor recreation opportunities make it a great place to live. it's certainly no montreal, or toronto, but i don't find it boring either. the low cost of living and fairly relaxed attitude of many locals also help make it a place where people make time to enjoy life.
however, you may be surprised to find that :
* francophone québec, of which our city is a major part, can feel like a self-contained society, as opposed to canada, which is kind of a like a cultural extension of the us. you may love or hate this, but you'll learn a bunch of new cultural references and idioms and will discover that people can have different concerns here than in ontario. major kudos to you for speaking some french and showing an interest in improving it, you'll find that this will go a long way.
* the canadian stereotype of politeness does not apply here. people are sincere, honest and friendly, but will not be polite or apologize just for the sake of being nice and keeping the peace. i personally find that canadians can sometimes be passive-agressive as they will be respectful to the point where they will step on their principles in order to be "nice". work culture may also be different than what you're used to, as confrontation may be more common. (i'm a teacher and i find québec parents a lot more confrontational and up front about their concerns than their anglophone compatriots)
* many québec city residents, most of whom reside in very white suburbs, have not encountered a lot of diversity. while most people are accepting and open to differences, you may be the first south asian person they meet. this is not necessarily a bad thing, but it will feel different for sure. a decent person who is not a racist may still make awkward comments when they first meet someone whose name they have a hard time pronouncing.
* although 2/3 of québécois people support bill 21, and there is an unfortunate current of  xenophobia in the older generations, it's worth taking the time to understand why many older people here deeply resent organized religion. there is a broad consensus that islamophobia is unacceptable and that we need to do more to welcome people of diverse backgrounds, but "becoming a québécois" can seem like it's harder than "becoming canadian". while justin trudeau's canada is *a patchwork of cultures where everyone is welcome to live as they please*, people here think of québec as *a great,* ***french-speaking*** *nation which you are welcome to join*. (i think bill 21 is a clumsy way to play to the nationalist vote and it sends a bad message to muslims who love québec. any human who treats you badly because of your religion is a d\*ck, but paying attention to "the concerns of québec", as opposed to dismissing everyone as a bunch of troglodytes, is worth your time)
you'll love it here : there is so much to do, we have many walkable, bikeable communities where driving is not required and the pace of life is slower than in toronto. i hope things go the way you plan and that you at least come apartment hunting :)
happy to pm if you have any questions!
hello,
it seems to me that you know the french language well enough to live there. ;-)
i don't know toronto very well, but i think house prices in quebec are at least 50% cheaper….
for public transport if you live near an "80x" line, it will be fine. look on metrobus on the rtc quebec site.
i don't know what to say about the fourth item… ..
i think quality of life depends if you like big cities or being outdoors. if you like the latter quebec is way better than the gta. nature is very accessible here. if you like the former you might find quebec's nightlife dissapointing. speaking french is pretty important if you're going to be here for a while and want to make friends.
hi! i was born in quebec city. love it, it's beautiful and all, but... it's very small, very french and very white, therefore aren't a lot of good choice when it comes to multicultural food etc. and since it's very small and not a whole lot of things to do, you can get bored fast. i lived in toronto, shanghai and now i live in montreal. i've got used to live in big cities and having a lot of choice when it comes to asian supermarkets, restaurants, things to do, etc. and as much as i love quebec city as my native hometown, as much i can't really go back to live there as i'm afraid i'd be bored out of my mind. anyways i don't know you very well so you may be looking for a more quiet life i don't know, however if you need the big city life, go to montreal instead.
hi! i second what others say about the quality of life in quebec.
automotive side, i work very well without it for everyday life. it limits the places you can go a bit (especially as soon as you leave the city), but you learn to function very well. i live in montcalm; i have the 800, 801, 802 and 807 passing nearby; i can walk to the grocery store, the pharmacy, the library or the plains. for trips outside the city, it is certain that a car helps a lot. i have several friends who have a tank so i often carpool with them. otherwise, i also recommend communauto: their cars are really practical and that gives a little more freedom!
for french, quebec city is really a french speaking city. so, others said, the more you speak the better and easier it will be. if you have the will to learn, it will be quite an immersion and i'm pretty you'll rapidly get fluent enough to hold a conversation. on the other hand, if you want to stick to english as much as possible, it might be difficult on the long run...
compared to toronto, life is different because it's so much smaller. it's definitely quieter, even if toronto is in itself somewhat for a city this size. i would say that the main difference is that nature activities are all around the city. you drive 30-45 minutes and you're basically in the wild... most people that don't like the city are people that don't like outdoor activites. and winter can be quite long with six months in the snow if don't like some winter sports or activities. and yes, housing is much cheaper than toronto (average house price fro april 2021 was 230 000$).
the bus work fairly well on the east-west axis along the main streets and boulevard. going north-south is much more akward and complicated. if you want to live without a car, your best bet is looking somewhere along the 800-801-807 bus rides. 
for religion, people don't care as long as you don't push it on them. so, keep it personal and in your house and you'll have no problem at all.
i was a bus commuter before covid and it was fine.
the bus are almost never late and the rtc app show where the next one is.
you should nevertheless be cautious about where you'll live and where you'll work because you could be 5km away but without any direct bus, it could take 1h to get there.
you should check the bus routes to get a good idea.
depending on your budget or your desires, there are several districts where the 800,801,802 metrobus pass very frequently.
i spent several years without a car but with a communauto subscription. this company allows you to rent a car by the hour and everything is included in the price, even fuel.
you even have a special bus + communauto package: 
usually people here have no opinion of what you think or your religion and respect your beliefs as long as you respect their beliefs too.
wherever i have worked, i have never experienced a single problem between my muslim colleagues and others.
even at my old job, everyone used to say eid mubarak to celebrate eid.
if that happens to you, i'm sure you'll love the accent of a guy from saguenay trying to say eid mubarak.
if you like to ski, you will be at the right place! great mountains within 45 minute drive. there is an english community in quebec city. quebec city is quite homogenous, lots of nice suburbs to choose from. québecers are really welcoming, even more if you make an effort to speak french.
i recently made the same move as the one you’re considering. looks like you’ve received plenty of answers already but let me know if you have any other questions.
hey! i live in mississauga but my partner is from quebec city. ive gone many times for extended stays and might move there eventually.
awesome city with non interrupted bike lanes.
way cheaper.
learn french as people arent the most open minded.  i am trying to learn french and when i visit all the store clerks change from french to english and snarl a bit.
people go out every day to parks at 5pm for all night, very different vibe than the city.
i recommend in being in low downtown near the river.
very freakin safe city! youll never feel unsafe even if you only speak a little french.
> i am ethnically south asian, and i am from a muslim background (though only semi-practicing), with bill 21 and all, do i need to worry about racism? i am male so the hijab issue isn't a direct concern
there is a cultural difference that is important to know. if people ask you where you're from, * that's legitimate curiosity *, it's not a roundabout or passive-aggressive way of telling you that you don't belong here.
**how much french would i need to know? i can kinda speak it, but i stumble a lot and am not at all fluent in it.**  
i would say some basic french is alright, the quebec government offers francization courses, people will try to speak english if they see that you're having a hard time however some people here have a difficult time speaking english as well. more info can be found on their website: [online courses, learn french](
**how is life like over here compared to toronto?**  
quebec city is a lot quieter than toronto that i can say. there's not as many events, or restaurants as say toronto but if you like the quiet life, you'll like it here. it's like a blend of a village and a city. usually we joke around here about how much construction work there is, especially on the infrastructure part but i feel like this also applies to toronto...
** what is the quality of the transporte-en-commune here. you know the buses don't you? no metro or regional trails? can anyone live here without a car? **
the only public transport we have right now are the city buses, depend on your work location or where you live, it is entirely possible to live with just a bus. there's the metrobus that arrives every 5-15 minutes so you don't have to wait too long. there are plans about a tramway system being built but it's been delayed so many times that i have no clue if they'll ever build it... more info on the city buses can be found here: [rtc]( 
**i am ethnically south asian, and i am from a muslim background (though only semi-practicing), with bill 21 and all, do i need to worry about racism? i am male so the hijab issue isn't a direct concern**
there's a community of muslims in quebec city they have businesses built up in the city as well. islamophobia is sadly still a thing around here but as far as i can tell it hasn't gotten any worse over the past few years. speaking of islam, happy eid!
don’t worry you will be fine.
i wouldn't count on any public transportation until the tramway comes in which will take a couple years (and will cause a nightmare of construction in the meantime); quebec city is a car-centric city where pedestrians and public transport commuters are second class. 
where's your workplace? if you're downtown, get a place to live nearby. check to make sure that you have a decent grocery walking distance and activities you'd enjoy. i'm working in st-roch so i got myself a place in front of the old port; there's a communal garden nearby and a marina where i can take sailing classes. i take walk in the old quebec and go to the public library on the regular. 
is it safe for muslims? if anywhere is unsafe for muslims in canada it's probably here:
[  
also the birthplace of la meute:  
[  
... and atalanta:
muslim women who cannot have certain jobs are certainly more impacted than you are, a little empathy would be in order. "no one cares about that", certainly not among your entourage, but you were not the person targeted by this law either.
a 200k condo in quebec would easily cost 1m in toronto. we are talking more about a difference of about 500%.
not quite sure about the "unsafe for muslim" part. the guy targeted the mosque because a lot of world news where talking about islam. a few moments before shooting the mosque, the guy was in the laurier mall and wanted to shoot everyone there.
the sick fuck wanted to be "famous", he had no specific opinion regarding muslims.
i have a bunch of muslim colleagues of both sexes and they themselves say it's rubbish ...
except they can get the job if they leave their religion at home.
it's hard for them, but that's life. religion is a choice so they can decide for themselves.
imagine being a jew and applying for welfare, and being turned down by someone who wears the veil. the person is definitely going to have religious discrimination in mind as the reason for refusal, and with what's going on in the world, that wouldn't be too "far fetched".
quebec abandoned christianity en masse in the 1960s, see the quiet revolution. we don't want "our" church in government decisions, why will we have to accept that other religions are?
law 21 has 1 problematic, it does not go far enough towards the christian history here (the famous cross).
😳
a fairytale that doesn't fit with the facts...
at 4:14 p.m., he consulted the facebook page of the centre culturel islamique de québec (cciq). at 5:28 p.m., he looked at the twitter account of canadian prime minister justin trudeau, and more specifically a publication entitled “to those fleeing persecution, terror and war, canadians will welcome you regardless of your faith, diversity is our strength.” a short time later, at 5:56 p.m., he again visited the website of the centre culturel islamique de québec.[8]
[15]     bissonnette then went to his parents’ home to have supper with them.[9] he knew that he was expected to go back to work the next morning, january 30, 2017.[10]
[16]     after supper, he went to his room to look at other sites on suicide and mass killings. at about 7:00 p.m., he turned off his computer, took two of his firearms and ammunition, and then left[11] the family home, telling his mother that he was going to run some errands and might stop at his gun club.[12] he considered himself fit to drive his father’s mitsubishi vehicle[13] at that time.
[17]     bissonnette went directly to the great mosque. on arriving, he remained in the vehicle for a few minutes, overwhelmed with anxiety. he said to himself: [translation] “i can’t do this.” he then went to a convenience store and bought a vodka ice that he quickly drank. he then decided to return to the islamic cultural centre and parked behind the building, on monseigneur-grandin street.[14] he had the impression that he had been seen, in possession of his weapons, by an unidentified person. he then believed that he had reached the point of no return.[15]
i know what this sickfuck (i won't say his name) did and i know he targeted the mosque.
[
*two months before killing six men inside a quebec city mosque, he sat in the parking lot of a nearby shopping centre, debating whether he should go in and kill unsuspecting shoppers, then commit suicide, a quebec city court heard monday.*
*he was obsessed with the need to give a "a sense of grandeur" to his death*.
[ 
* obsessed for months by the fear that immigrants would commit attacks on quebec soil, he thought he could “save hundreds of lives” by attacking muslims on the evening of january 29, 2017. *
* "i said to myself that, perhaps, thanks to what i have done, there will be a hundred people who will be saved. maybe 200, maybe 300 people there too. you never know "*
what i meant is that whatever mind issues this guy has, he is not the proof that québec is the worse city for muslims in canada. (especially after what happened in london last month)
is it you me or we beat a lot of records this year
summer is getting longer!
as well to get used to beating some unfortunately
it will be fine. having already lived in montreal, it was not so long ago that st catherine was completely in the dark and to be avoided as a pedestrian and st denis was dying.
on st joseph, soon a new library, pedestrian street, tramway. we still have plenty of super hot commerce.
it is certain the construction is flat and the world seems to have a more noticeable problem with the inn. but, i found st joseph to be very cool all summer long, very crowded east of the crown. the only place that is not as crowded is the st joseph part west of dorchester. but, he only had the deux22, korrigane and post office open. district and d'auteil was closed, and this part of the street has been less exciting since the circle left.
it's just little growing pains.
i went for a walk on monday at noon i think and the weather was great. there were really quite a few people on saint-joseph. the work was really noisy on the other hand, it was very unpleasant and it affected my pleasure a little.
also this summer when i went there was a lot of bustle. i went there mostly during the day though.
but it is certain that on saint-joseph there are still quite a lot of all kinds of people, if i may put it mildly.
it's boring to say, but the move from auberivière didn't really help ... i live between the two buildings and the difference is obvious since the move. the outdoor space is more limited so the clientele of the place is held directly in the rue du pont and as far as charest. it's really a funny atmosphere and with the calm of st-joseph you can only see that ....
i live in the neighborhood ... it's really since the pandemic that rue st-joseph has fallen back into the void. construction does not help. :(
you yourself say that it is "the first day in the office since the start of the pandemic".
is it the chicken or the egg?
i work in st-roch and it is indeed sad. 2-3 years ago it was pretty good.
now we are back in zombieland.
call a spade a spade.
just a block change has such a big impact?
for my part, to live there too, i find that it is not bad all the time like that. we remove the workers from 9 to 5 and voila ...
maybe it's just just me going out at the wrong time!
it is not false.
what's the name of the cat?
oh sure. it surprises me that the majority of restaurants have survived. but this summer, with the pedestrian streets, things were moving a lot!
yeah, it's the same. there's just less people so we don't see the bums anymore.
at the beginning it was funny, there were only police officers and bums in the street.
i recommend you read [this article]( we love our pools.
i was talking with a swedish friend and he said "hire the guy who managed to convince quebeckers to buy swimming pools and he'll be your best sales person".
it's so strange. why are we obsessed with pools? we can barely enjoy them work our short summers.
it's fucking funny right?we got a saying, " inflatable neighbor"it might have something to do with it.  
also water tribe
i can't wait to have a pool when we buy a house.
haha yes in the suburbs most people have pool. it’s so strange to see that from a plane.
i don't know if this could be related to the fact that there's still a lot of people "watering" their asphalt entryway so water isn't really a concern especially in the me myself and i suburbs of qc
also in quebec, you don't pay your water, unlike in ontario. so i'm guessing that's a huge factor that come into play.
we love to gather around the pool. it geeks like we're enjoying the summer more
we do (my family)
i used too but it broke
i didn't give a shit about pools until.i got.my.own with a decl and straight accès right from the house...i cant go back...
this is great! thank you
summer is so short yet very hot and humid and most people do not have ac. i love swimming too so when the three month window of pool season presents itself, i just enjoy a good refreshing swim.
we can only enjoy our pools for a few months, but be enjoy the fuck out of them when we can 😎
i can't wait to has't a pool at which hour we buyeth a house

commands: `!shakespeareinsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout`
it's a great article but i think the reason we have so many pools is more than just a good marketing ploy. we (quebeckers) seem to have a "gene" that makes us want to live closer to water.
we're all descendants of people who built houses by the st-laurent river. there are 6 millions lakes in québec and probably more than 6 millions km of rivers. every family i know has someone who owns a cabin, a summer house, a house or a fishing camp by a lake, a river or the river (st-lawrence). i'm not rich by any measure but i'm self employed and do not need to be close to the city. my house is right by a lake (a very small one). water is everywhere here and we seem to need it. 
the other possible explanation is that we just can stand the heat! our winters are long, cold and brutal. when the heat comes in during summer we just need something to cool down.      
just my 0.02$
bad bot
when i travel between my home region and the south i need to go through a lot of wildlife reserves. they seem to be nothing but a series of ascents and descents and whenever you hit the top of the hill you get great views of sometimes dozens of lakes. always look forward to those sights even if the drive itself sucks and i hate it lol.

hey there! hope you settle well. what is tech industry for you? software or hardware?
nice to meet you! in the tech industry here too !
almost all tech people speak both language. what kind of tech sector? i'm a programmer for automated web processes.
me too! moved from toronto, both me and my partner work in tech. feel free to send a message!
difficult time to make new friends when moving in, but we'll do our best! feel free to drop me a dm. (i'm also working in tech; video games counts, right?)
do you prefer to chat in french to improve yourself or in english to stay comfortable? because i noticed a phenomenon that seems to be confirmed by research: when you establish a relationship with someone in a language, it does not matter if it is the mother tongue or not of one or the other, this language is strongly associated with the relationship and it seems unnatural to speak another language with this person, even if both speak this other language better. i noticed that two english speaking ontarian friends who got to know each other here speak french for this reason, despite their accents.
i don't want to tell you what to do or judge yourself, i just want to warn you of what might happen so that you realize it and decide what you prefer (between making new relationships in english or in french). of course, nothing prevents you from finding certain friends with whom you will speak in french and others with whom you will speak in english. but don't expect it to be easy to switch from one language to another with the same person, even if they are fluently bilingual.
that being said. i also work in it (it). i would be happy to speak to you in the language of your choice between french, english, spanish, italian or esperanto. i have a basic knowledge of german and hungarian too, but i am not comfortable enough to have a conversation in these two languages.
if you are in it, you can join the open code community 
it's good people!
i can't give the info now i'm on the go, but if you are looking for linux, opensource, devops leave me a message i'll make you a meetup bundle and similar activity. it can help you "meet" people and make connections! also i can give you a hand with some work if you haven't found it yet!
welcome to quebec!
actually it's neither, i work on the data analytics/data science side
that's good to know. i'm more on the data analytics/data science side of tech. is there a big tech scene in quebec city? or is that more montreal?
awesome! just dm'd
that certainly counts! dm'd you
i don't really have a preference but it's more to just inform people that i would not be as efficient in french :-p
vetiq, it's an organization called "voix des entreprises en technologie de l'information de québec."
for about 90% of french-speaking quebecers, that doesn't bother them at all, quite the contrary: it shows a desire to integrate and discover quebec culture. and in the 10% that it bothers, it is especially when it is a oriented conversation (an interaction in a business, a request for directions in the street, etc.) that it bothers them. when it's to discuss everything and nothing informally, like we do with a friend, there is a lot less pressure to be efficient in our exchanges!
my balls felt it
since friday(august 27th) the temperatures have been really pleasant!
sounds about right. i’m so glad the temperature has dropped since!
i have the ominous feeling that we are, somehow,  going to pay for this in a not so far future.
funny having to sleep with a fan in mid-october
hurray for climate change i guess
calvert that this is depressing.
racism in quebec is grossly exaggerated by canadian media. you’ll find no more or less racism here than you’ll find in any white communities in the rest of the country
to improve your french it's simple. speak french as often as possible. if people answer you in english tell them that you want to practice your french. it will be difficult at first but it will come quickly. probably some course exists but i can't help you on that side. doing activities in the evening can also help you a lot with your french. but i don't fear, a good majority of quebecers speak a minimum of english.
depending on what you're looking for, central neighborhoods are good options. limoilou, st-roch, st-jean-batiste, montcalm and st-sacrament. i do not recommend st-sauveur due to the transport in commum which will be more difficult for you. if you are looking for more suburbs, beauport or charlesbourg and even st-foy are good options.
i'm a white man so it's hard for me to give you a concrete opinion on racism. i will therefore abstain.
i'd suggest living in uppertown where you have 800' lines which are frequent and will get you pretty much anywhere, walking to work might be an option too if you don't have to climb the hill. racism isn't a big issue in quebec city, at least not in the open and especially when you're downtown, suburbs can be another story.
montcalm is probably your best option to live. a bit pricey but close to your workplace, grocery stores and plenty of activities. about the racism, i can only speak from my perspective as a white male in couple with a black haitian woman. in 20 years or so, she never came up to me saying she’s been involved in a racist incident; same for our kids. i sincerely think quebec is an inclusive and really great city to live, whatever your ethnicity ans sexual identity or orientation.
stay close to the main arteries (with the rtc express, that's fine!) as for racism, i myself am a person of color but unfortunately there are some. it's a lot less worse than before, but there are some. i would use the term ignorance more than racism but still it's present
frankly, your french is already 1000 times better than mine was when i arrived here.
my opinion: we must not give up. in several shops / restaurants people will switch to english to help you when they hear an accent. the temptation might be strong to accept it, but don't. you have to insist in french otherwise your french will never improve.
as for racism, there is of course, but no more than elsewhere. in my experience, the vast majority of people are super nice.
where you may be a little shocked is in some boomer media. stay away from the quebecor media (journal de quebec / montreal, tva ...) and you should get by.
im born in qc and lived 10 years in toronto, now back in qc
learning french should not be a challenge, or at least you wont lack opportunities to practice since 99% of everything is done in french here with some ppl who dont speak english at all.. should be fine just doing your own thing, is work going to be in french? 
public transit in qc is nowhere near as good as torontos or mtl, if youre going to go carless my advice is stick to the ste-foy / montcalm area.
stay near blvd laurier (biggest bus line) and stay between the plaines of abraham and place laurier (shopping centre) public transit is half decent anywhere in that area. 
i live in montcalm by the plaines, right next to your work, its the best area imo, a bit more expensive but youll find it cheap compared to toronto thats for sure. its the nicest imo with lots of small shops and restaurants, kinda feels like young and eglinton?? 
racism, i honestly dont think there is much but im white, so i have no idea, i really really dont think youll encouter much of it, hope you wont! however, 9/10 person here is white, its much much less diversified than toronto or mtl.
i also think if youre gonna travel and discover this beautiful province be wary, once u exit qc english speaking goes way down and i think racism might go up a tad, but dont let that scare you, hope u enjoy cheers
health,
i suggest that you speak and write as often as possible in french. i have no doubt with your level that you will progress quickly. i suggest you write to me privately if you want to have a conversation via reddit. i can tell you about the city and the different things i know about it. i have lived here all my life.
it would be best if you get better in french but this isn't mandatory; if you go to stores / restaurants, folks will probably be able to help you in english. they'll appreciate if you do the effort and they'll probably switch in english for your convenience. 
there was a case of extreme racism a few years ago but as far as i know, my non native colleagues told me it's not a racist city. there's always some dumbasses and it's no different in quebec city but the city is enough "big" that people aren't surprised to see some from another country / nation.
for your accommodation, look in montcalm and saint-sacrement. these are very good neighborhoods, close to your work and well served by public transport.
welcome to quebec !!
you could look around in other neighborhoods that have express buses that go in town. i live on the 804 route, nice superb and it takes me 15 min of bus service to be in laval university's bus hub, then take another 800 that goes on renee-levesque (couple minutes walk from grande allee)
look into veq.ca, they could help you out with french and finding support in the city for anglophones
i highly recommend you the carsharing communauto. it’s a really cheap and really reliable way to get cars for doing to groceries or going somewhere poorly deserved by public transport. with that, i’m able to live in downtown qc without cars even tho this city is so much car oriented.
the best neighborhood are st-jean-baptism, st-roch, st-sauveur and limoilou. they are all near old québec. i would stay away from old québec since it’s poorly deserved by public transport and groceries and all other things a neighborhood usually needs. housing and rent went up since the pandemic like everywhere else, but it’s still one of the most affordable place in québec.
i’m from montréal and coming to québec and meeting quebecers was quite a challenge. i’ve noticed people from québec tend to be more rigid and harder to develop bond with. but i’ve also had to same problem in toronto. what i would recommend you to find an activist group that would suit your value. it could be a political party or a social justice group of an issue you find important or even just volunteering. you will find that way people that share the same value and that are open to create bond.
good luck and chat with my if you have more questions 🙂
[deleted]
write to me in pv if you want us to go and walk on the plains to practice your french!
this.
ok. good to know! living in an old building does sound exciting!
health,
thanks for the help!
>they'll probably switch in english for your convenience. 
please stop doing this.
if i am speaking french, and the point is understood, switching to english won't help me learning french.
signed- an anglo who lives here now and still can't speak proper french after a year. working on it, but, too many want to practice their english.
should mention my work is in english, so, that doesn't help me. i can't write french, either. but, i can read it pretty good now.
thanks for the insight!
thank you for the help. so from what i gather it is best to be near old  québec but avoid old québec itself because that is more tourist oriented and not really a place to libe.
> o find an activist group that would suit your value. it could be a political party or a social justice group of an issue you find important or even just volunteering. 
interesitng. thanks! any idea where to find these opportunities? i guess joining a political party is something i can do
thanks for the help!
until you pay thr hydro bill in winter!
it's 50 50, some people are glad that we switch, some others asked to continue in french.
just be consistent and continuous in french even if the person answers you in english. she'll figure it out and switch again, or in the worst case you're going to have practiced anyway. it's a little too easy to blame people because you're not comfortable in french after 1 year when you can easily continue practicing.
also every neighborhood in québec city has citizen committee. they are citizen organisations with a small budget given by the city to organize event in the neighborhood. they are called “conseil de quartier” and everybody can participate. 
or the mold smell...
i do try and stay in french, but i find that most don't switch back to french, then we both end up like we are now, speaking both languages, except most of the time i get someone that can't really speak english, and they get me that is not really good in french.
but, ya, it's not others people's fault. i am trying to get some proper french instruction, it will really help. i won't be living here long (3 or 4 more years), but, it will be a life skill that will help me in the future. especially since we want our daughter to be perfectly bilingual.
cool. thanks!!
hey welcome, 
yes shipping is reliable, just make sure to be home for big stuff that is not coming with post canada you will need to go super far away to get it. with post canada not as problematic they will have a place near your address mostly on pharmacy stores. 
appliances: depending on where you buy they can connect it for you, it will be specified to add it when purchased. if delivered yes, they will take it to your appartement. i don’t tip if there is already a delivery fee. for best prices check online is mostly the same stuff everywhere. 
the only shop in old quebec that locals buy is simmons. they have more locations. to find normal shops just go to the malls (laurier quebec, place sainte foy, galeries de la capitale )
water is free you will not pay for it. 
electricity: yes you need to register / create an account on hydro-quebec. you can do this on their website directly, your need the appartement address. you don’t need to be in the appartement to do this. is mostly an account transfer procedure and not anything that will be physically connected.
prices vary a lot, depending on size, insulation of the place and season. on hydro-québec you can choose how you will pay (same each month, you will pay the difference after or you can pay real consumption every 2/3)
 hope this helps!
will try to help.
first, welcome!
as for your questions.
- shipping is generally very reliable, but not so cheap nor ultra fast. the national post service have fast options and there are numerous private shippers who handle both incoming and outgoing mail/packages. experience vastly depends though (if you can, always ask for a signature upon delivery). pretty sure plenty of people had many bad experiences.
- appliances: service varies quite a lot, but with most large retailer (best buy, check also home depot, canadian tire, leon or local stores like tanguay), they always can include delivery and the hooking of trickier devices (ie: dishwasher). check during checkout.
- daily shopping: malls are probably your better options but they are not that close to old quebec (think 30 minutes bus ride), yet easily connected. large ones like laurier or fleur de lys might do the trick. near old quebec, walk up and down st-jean outside the walls or go downtown on st-joseph and you should find shops for your needs. food wise, check for supermarkets. unfortunately, old quebec is very much geared towards visitors or short term stays, so most day to day shops left...
- water is included. what you need to connect is hydro quebec (power). call them/go online for an appointment, it's easy to setup. prices can vary depending on your use and heating during winter (and how well isolated is the appartment). i'm pretty sure that hydro have an "estimate cost" website in which you can try with your address.
hope this helps. every bit of french will also help you tremendously as quebec city is very much french, much more so that montreal, where service is english is a bit more widely available. check out community organization in english if you fear this might be an issue, like voice of english quebec.
also, you'd be surprised how much of the basic daily stuff you'll find in big pharmacy brands (jean coutu, brunet, uniprix) drugs and pills are far from being their only business (i don't know how it is in china or japan, but in comparison to europe our pharmacies are... weirdly packed with stuff.)
as a local, you'll want to shop **outside** of the walled-city. apart from a few notable exception, everything in there is tourists orientated.
i settled downtown when i came in the city and you'll find cool stores and restaurants on saint-jean street (stay outside of the fortifications), saint-joseph street in downhill saint-roch and the 3rd avenue in limoilou, you'll have to visit ste-foy's malls (bus 800-801) for clothes mainly. forget about fleur de lys it was dying before the pandemic and it somehow got even worst now.
i would like to add that a place to buy small stuff (nails cutter and such) close to old quebec is escompte lecompte on rue st-joseph. things on that neighborhood will be cheaper than in the old quebec, that's more where young people lives.
during the worst months of the pandemic, big appliances installation were suspended, but i think it's all good now that people are getting vaccinated and restrictions are being lifted. but you do need to confirm the delivering and installation while buying as they will charge you for that. 
i only tip in bars and restaurants or when i order food at home, as the incoming of the people working on those services usually haevly depends on the tipping. otherwise i just don't tip.
hey! i'm a university and currently study chinese  language as a side program. send me a dm if you have any questions!
that wasn't in your questions, but knowing french is gonna help. in fact, it won't just help, it will allow you to properly live here. québec is a french speaking province (outside of montreal let's say, which is still mainly french but more international) so naturally, understanding the language and being able to communicate in it are going to make your life so much easier on many levels. that said, i know learning a language takes time and it's not easy, and i wanna add that i noticed the few words in french you added to your post and i highly respect you for doing that. cheers :)
if you want to reach out to others in the english-speaking community here, i recommend joining the "anglophones living in quebec city" facebook group. 
all the best!
thanks for the tips! :-)
thanks for the tips! :-)  
haha i realized old-quebec is too tourism as well,   
that's one of the reason i chose my next apartment to be a more residential location. (in 
a district called limoilou)
living in old-quebec is not easy to sleep as well,   
since i'm hearing loud and noisy car engine running every night lol.
thanks,   
actually in japan it works the same that i can buy lots of stuffs in pharmacy. 
good to know.  
:-)
thanks, i will go visit. :-)
thanks for the tip (pun)! xd
thanks, will dm you after work! :-)
yea french is absolutely the language i’m learning, 
i know it’s not an english territory.
and will register to quebec french learning program too when life is settled down.
thank you! :-)
it's all beautiful, but will the police be present enough? surely not. on the corner where i am, people are not making their compulsory stop and are clearly going faster than 50 km / h. if there are no tickets currently being given and people do not respect the 50 km / h, i can not wait to see if these new limits will have a result.
“quebec city is unveiling an interactive map of streets where the speed limit will be restricted to 40 and 30 km / h.”
it would be helpful to put the link to the map prominently in the article ... anyone have the link?
sounds good, anyway. i did not know that such measures were coming.
good news
i didn't know it was coming but i like it, if you drive more than 35 in these streets it's cowboy pretty much anyway ...
am i the only one who spent more time trying to understand the map than reading the article?
this regulation is nonsense. just enough to give the oxen the opportunity to give you an igv. what about the signage ...
colist, it's cave, all because the little mother complains
the [best i found] ( .. .
the map shown in the article is not very clear. the city has posted the information here and it's easier to understand: 
username checks out.
all this because more than 150 pedestrians are struck by cars each year in quebec, of which between 5 and 10 die.
it does not seem to be broadcast yet 
edith: it's available on the map now. check out my link.
if they have been hit, it's because they are crossing in the wrong place and they are not on the sidewalks, that's the problem, walking in the street, that street is not for pedestrians
ahh. i imagine you got that out of a credible article and not out of your ass. and secondly, when you're driving in town, it's not just on street corners where you have to look for pedestrians. it's * all the time *.
i think that's the most dumb comment i've read this month, and there have been some good championship contenders too! congratulation!
welcome to quebec, where the motorists are driving too fast not to pick up a yellow / red and lose 4 minutes in waiting, or the pedestrians cross the streets dangerously because if you don't step on the piton enough in advance you will miss your pedestrian and have to wait for another cycle (4 minutes).
criss that i hate the lights here, as much as a pedestrian as a motorist.
quebec and montreal have a different approach to integrating other road users.
montreal has integrated these other road users, everyone uses the road at the same time.
quebec has been with an exclusive approach to the road. which means when it's time for pedestrians only they occupy the road. and the rest of the time only cars are on the road.
quebec is not the only city with this approach in the province. in fact, the more i think about it, i have never seen the integration of pedestrians into automobile traffic anywhere other than montreal and its surroundings in the province.
when i'm on foot, i find the exclusive right of way quite interesting: no pressure from motorists pushing you in the ass to go faster. during the 18 years that i spent in montreal, i always found it really kidding. this is something that i like in quebec (where i have lived for 1 year), even if yes, it is true that it is long. :-)
in my suburb in sainte-foy, one or two winters ago, the city thought it was a good idea to change the cycle of lights on boulevard quatre-bourgeois, near duplessis.
before, you could cross the boulevard up, down or across, one-shot in 20 seconds.
now you can only do it long or wide at the same time and you have to wait a long time, extremely painful in winter ...
it sucks on pedestrians in the administration.
the problem in montreal is that pedestrians do not respect the red tite-main which says not to engage. cars have to cut nasty pedestrians while checking blind spots to avoid bikes / scooters / scooters / scooters / dogs / cats / skunks / groundhogs / pigeons and squirrels who don't care about the light to cross. on the big lights there is a precise order, the pedestrian must respect the red tite-main!
clearly. as a pedestrian it is direct blade. tlm try to cross anytime because of it
even the police can roll over the world without any consequences
i have a beautiful view of 1st avenue from my office, the number of people i see jaywalker quietly on the 4 lanes even if there are tanks arriving. mongolian asser.
totally agree! it's nuts
i am convinced that it is a plot by labaume to take the bus and want the tram. it desynchronizes the lights, makes roads that have no meaning, eternal work that fixes nothing, the list goes on.
without forgetting the priority crossings of pedestrian or you have to impose yourself at the risk of losing your own life so that the motorists stop suddenly while being angry.
or the synchronized light handle in quebec, you pass ready to get hit because motorists think they can turn right when the signage indicates an arrow going straight (which means an obligation to go exclusively forward ).
or pedestrians do not look at the bike path before crossing the street.
i'm a shovel, but i'll calm down haha.
continue in the same way, you will be able to replace gravel with your choice.
it's on it's so optimal han it's like putting a lot of effort into the problem. : p by the way, i don't even know who i don't know if you're trying to insult me or i don't know. you don't have to be a genius to realize that it can be improved quite a bit.
131 rooms, when they serve 400 soups a day and help 5000 different people in 2020, i feel like it's not enough rooms. is there anyone knowledgeable in the field who could explain this to us?
i'm guessing not everyone who eats there necessarily sleeps there. but i don't know the details.
the biggest danger in quebec is to cross someone from montreal.
for its category, quebec is the safest city in america.
i live in old quebec and i often find myself walking alone outside bars in the middle of the night and i've never had any problems. i never even felt stressed to be alone
i'm a man in his thirties and a woman stopped me in a dark street, the only two other people visible walking away, approached me to ask for directions.
i walked alone in the st-roch district (probably the place most associated with hard drugs and prostitution) at midnight and saw nothing illegal.
quebec's mascot should be the quokka.
quebec is comparable to dubai or taiwan in terms of risk. 5th out of 433 major cities in the world: 
no worries for quebec, beautiful city and very safe!
not in quebec, no, really not.
thank you everyone
living in old quebec, my only advice is not to follow someone who "needs help", especially in dark places. walking the streets of the old is safe.
the main problem with quebec is probably its racist and violent spouses. if you are white you don't have to worry if you are not, you might get insulted. this is the main type of misadventure i have heard. otherwise, there is no danger unless you are really unlucky. you just have to practice normal safety rules like watching your drink if you go to a bar alone.
no quebec is ridiculously safe
ta yeule, i went to st-roch and it was full of quirks. worse than what i see in montreal.
and ~~ 3rd ~~ 5th in the world.
edit: my sources date back a few years. we have lost 2 ranks since.
i live in st roch and the scariest thing in quebec is the restaurants that catch tourists who charge exorbitant amounts for uneatable food xd
ah! we dropped 2 ranks ... we were 3rd a year or 2 ago.
edit: i wonder if the attacks of 2017 and 2020 are the (only) cause of this tumble ...
i was talking about the katana episode my little 2 watts
unfortunately, wherever there are humans there is mental illness. the reason that there are a lot of "tout croches" in saint-rock is because the services for people without resources are located there.
but, to say that it is worse than montreal, do not exaggerate ... then, saint-rock is far from being a tourist district ...
lol all the misery of quebec goes into the bonaventure station.
the very crooked ones would do a lot of harm to a fly. a juicé mtl douchebag on the other hand ...
statically speaking it's probably because of the guy who thought he was a samurai on halloween that we dropped so much.
source?
i worked in saint-roch and it sure happened to me to be hissed / accosted by a suspicious guy in a tank (in broad daylight ...) / yell at someone who is not well in the corner of a street, but i was never afraid
there are tourist trap shops too that sell out of the box things.
certainly, it increased the number of homicides. but even despite that, it remains in 5th place, it shows how the city is not a risky destination.
if your definition of intelligence is measured by your knowledge of the tv show you watch, it's you who is not fast my big.
since he called it the nouvo st roch, it leads to thinking otherwise!
lol in both cases they are juicés and can act impromptu.
and by the way, there are more ti-coune douchebag in quebec.
yes, that and the mosque in 2017. that's what i thought too.
criss yes!
/ u / geologue-666 gave it [below] (
another time i was walking at night and saw a cat that i called. i didn't see a woman who was also there who thought i was doing a catcall \ *. she felt safe enough to piss me off even though we were alone in the street at night. i guess she wasn't scared either.
\ * technically it was true, but not to her.
ok i'll take a little 2 minutes to help you.
on october 31, 2020, a young man from montreal traveled to old quebec to attack random victims with a katana. he thus kills 2 people and injures 5 more.
this is the episode i'm talking about.
when we use the term "episode", it defines a period of time or an event associated with a collective memory. not necessarily the chapter of a series.
hope my explanation is clear enough to you.
it's definitely a new neighborhood if you compare to when st-joseph was still an mall. they didn't give this name for nothing, it really made a nice place.
"enweye kitty, don't be afraid, let yourself be flattered!" i admit that if she hasn't seen the cat… lol!
it remains the same principle that intelligence and knowledge are not the same thing but it got you 20 feet above your head
oh boy
apart from being patronizing i see that you have nothing to say. have a nice day!

we tried 2 bikes last week. one of the 2 bikes did not work with electric assistance, i called the rtc and told me that it happens quite often, to put the bike back in its anchorage and start over ... then, they have to make a withdrawal of $ 100 by bike, thats fine but i used it on july 18th, it is the 23rd and still no refund on my card. let's say that there is still a long way to go.
yeah the $ 6 per use is not cheap ...
i think their goal is to promote monthly subscriptions. it costs $ 30 per month for an unlimited number of trips of 30 minutes or less. it must be said that we can still get far in 30 minutes by electric bike.
the main problem as much as for me, it is the obligatory wearing of the helmet which removes any room for spontaneity and the use by the tourist clientele. i hope the saaq will loosen the rules eventually.
i think they are targeting the world of suburbs who come to town, park their tank further and take a tit ride on an electric bike.
but i liked the experience, you can handle the 35km / h without forcing
ordeal, if you are not able to put that for a service of this quality, pass your turn and it is over.
[deleted]
criss shut your eyes off
the goal is to make the bike available, if you want a bike for the day, you will rent one, this service already exists.
did you wrestle that it's electric bicycles
it's nice that you share this! let's help this country boy.
i hate it when the world just disappears. i can hardly imagine what terror that would do to my family.
he has been found!
not stupid, it would make it possible to undertake the long-term transition to rethink our cities and lifestyles ... elsewhere than around the car and the suburbs
what i dream of at least ...
completely agree with that. gosselin must think it's heresy again.
they need to significantly improve the transit system (frequency and route density) before making it free. otherwise ridership won't increase because it continues to suck outside of downtown, they'll lose a ton of money and declare it a failure, and then jack the fares up even higher.
seriously, it's almost always faster to walk/bike than it is to take the bus anywhere slightly far, or during off-peak hours. cutting the fare won't encourage anyone to switch to the bus.
i find it completely counterproductive as a solution to public transit. they need more money, not less.
for the majority of people, at least those i know, they don't use public transit for the sake of speed, not cost. how will reducing the possible revenues for the rtc help to correct this problem?
getting to work takes 17 mins in summer and 20 mins in winter by car vs 45mins for the perfect situation until 1:10 by bus, for having done it for a long time it already goes up to 1:30. with so much transfer and waiting outside that the only advantage i would have to take the bus, reading a book is not really practical.
under these conditions, even being free the bus would not be attractive to me.
are you the worst? there is a perfect bus for me, but i am not allowed to take it because it is an express. i live next to the first stop in the residential neighborhood and my job is the last stop in the residential neighborhood before the freeway.
i have called the rtc several times to tell them how ridiculous my situation is, but i doubt that will change.
rethinking our cities? the suburbs are here to stay hahaha
the two are not in opposition, but complementary. as seen in the 120 cities in the world that offer free transit, the services tend to get better at the same time, because the costs per travel goes down (with the increase in usage).
this is doubly true in quebec, because the provincial financing of public transit depends on its usage, so the more people use it, the more money the rtc gets from the provincial government.
1. free access increases usage, which reduces costs per trip (because most costs are fixed: the driver is not paid less when his bus is empty). so gratuity usually comes with an increase in the amount of service, as counterintuitive as that may sound. the examples of some 120 cities around the world that already do this demonstrate this.
2. modification: in fact, the waiting time on the climb is reduced by the fact that people do not have to stop to search and find their payment.
3. for your particular case, the rtc has already launched the idea of removing the up-hill limitations on the express routes and i support this proposal 100%.
modif: example of [dunkerque] (
about a third of the rtc's budget comes from users. if the service becomes free, there is a way to compensate for these losses otherwise.
ok ... so your solution is to do nothing at all?
i agree that transit should ultimately be free. but in these cities, was transit a viable option to driving throughout the service area before fare was abolished? my concern here is that cost isn't the main barrier to access. if service was instantly made free without very rapid improvement, i don't think ridership would increase by any significant amount, because most people won't want to switch from a 15 minute car commute to a 45 minute bus trip that makes you walk 15 minutes in the cold as well. not only that, but a gas tax would unfairly impact these drivers that really have no other good choice but to drive while the system is in its current state, while not being harsh enough to convince them to switch. 
i believe that by implementing urgent improvement before fare abolition (well ok, maybe at least reduce the fare a bit from its current absurd height), ridership would drastically increase, while they could keep fare revenue and then phase out fares while easily attracting more government funding.
maybe instantly abolishing fares would eventually accomplish the same thing, but it would happen much more slowly, while drivers would increasingly resent the government due to gas tax. the article didn't seem to suggest the the party has any sense of urgency to improve the system.
2.5, it is really unpleasant for the chauffeurs and firesides the conversation "ah bin mautadine, i forgot my opus pass in my other pants / i forgot to recharge it / my dog ate it".
i'm not convinced that free is the best solution if you look at other studies that show that people place little value on what they don't pay. for example, the free condoms distributed in some countries were not used while those at 2 or 3 cents (well below cost) were.
has anyone ever tried $ 1 for the ride? how does that compare to free?
what is your solution? i don't see a problem with the suburbs. if people want to live there, like me, it is because it still has its place.
the article covered the only announcement made in regard to the election that will happen in 6 months. there will be plenty more until then. no other municipal party has made any announcement yet, neither for a policy nor for a candidate.
i feel bad, the person who had the conversation, it was me a while ago when i realized that the nomad app had disconnected me and that for some reason x and that the connection was not working. i was like "scusez madam that's bug scusez scusez i'm trying but it doesn't connect me sorry i'm sorry" hahaha
i understand your point, but if you load an amount, it doesn't matter which one, it cannot completely solve the problem of "ah bin mautadine, i forgot my opus pass in my other pants / i forgot to recharge it / my dog ate it ”, nor that of the slowdown caused by all customers who must validate their payment. nor the saving of having to count all this.
indeed, if the rest of society has to pay for urban sprawl, to build new schools further and further away, new aqueduct, new roads, etc., society has to pay for your suburb.
sometimes people forget that their choice is subsidized by the rest of the world. your choice is not free. so yes, there is an interest in rethinking the city.
the first thing is to understand what the problem is and why it is.
rather than going over what is already known. i'll let you watch [this video] ( you can come back to me if you have any questions.
> i feel bad, the person who had the conversation, it was me earlier
there it was me. i arrive at the stop and the bus is already there. quick, i get back on the bus buying my ticket ... expired credit card. so the time to get the news, not very pleasant.
> if you charge an amount, it doesn't matter which, it can't completely solve the problem
sure, but if the * almost * free public transport carries more people, it's worth the cost. that's why i would like to know if there are any studies.
free is either the best solution or the second. it would be nice to know which one.
one idea that i have in mind that i wonder if it has already been applied somewhere is a substantial discount or free public transport for motorists. knowing that the world who already pay a butter for their tank and feel rightly or wrongly that they need it are not ready to pay the full price of public transport and will therefore instead just use their tank, if they are aim we get users who would not have taken the bus otherwise and we free the roads.
a city is not just the city center.
i'm already pretty sold on the ideas for the video but i'm not sure who the video is for. there are people like me who already agree and others who will be repelled by the hyper-moralizing tone.
most studies on free transport have been done in dunkirk, but some 120 cities around the world offer free transport in one form or another. in quebec, sherbrooke and quebec offer public transportation with university registration fees. it is not free, since the fees are taken with the registration fees, but students cannot opt out, and it allows a comparison with before its implementation. the results seem rather positive wherever we measure impacts.
i meant to compare the free to a minimal amount.
there are still too few studies on the subject, but it would be interesting indeed.
whoops.
quebec journal .....
there would be a parking lot not far from my home.
> in addition, 65% of those polled say that they would not use the tram to go to work or school after the pandemic.
this is the most important figure to remember. the majority of people are not interested in having electric trains on the road networks already served by the métrobus, not to mention the mess that this hasty project will create on the roads for the next few years.
perhaps 65% of respondents do not live near the tram route and it could not lead them to their work. i do not really see the relevance of this result without also asking who, among the respondents, lives or works near the route.
also, have you ever taken a metrobus at rush hour? if they are not saturated now, they will certainly be saturated by the end of the construction of the tram. the smart thing to do in transport is to build for the demand of the following decades, not the demand of the past.
the fact that 65% of people are not interested in taking the future tram (whether they live close to the route or not) proves that the future users of this gadget will be essentially the same who have adopted public transport with the routes of 'bus. what is the point of spending billions on a project that will be coveted by only a third of the population?
i worked for a long time on parliament hill, near the stop at the congress center. 90% of metrobuses were half full, even during peak hours.
metrobus full? we're adding metro buses ... problem solved?
i will repeat what mayor labeaume was told by young montreal graduates during a seduction mission in order to convince them to come and settle in quebec: almost all of them sent him for a walk. without efficient public transport in quebec, they would be forced to buy a car, so it takes them a salary of $ 5k to $ 10k more than quebec to justify a move. once the transport is built, many will use it. and if it isn't the current workers, it will be their children and the new inhabitants of the city.
it has been shown that most of the world say they do not want to change their habits when we only ask them to do so, however, in all the cities in the world where we have built a structuring means of public transport, the share of use of ct has increased considerably. can you tell me what makes quebec city particularly exceptional? what would cause the people of quebec to be more retarded than the rest of the planet? do garbage radios really have such an influence?
they are already enough ass to ass at rush hour to slow down car traffic, * despite a reserved lane * ...
> i will repeat what mayor labeaume was told by young montreal graduates
lord, labeaume is so desperate that he has to go to montreal to hear their opinion on the streetcar. why not stay in town and meet the workers, businesses and schools who are affected by the said project? it would make a difference for once.
the frequency is at 5 minutes .. so we can still put 4 ... 3..2 minutes etc
he did it too. the vast majority agree with the project.
with all the express, the reserved lane is full, the buses must take the car lane next to it. when are there too many buses for you and we have to consider another way? when cars can't pass at all?
modif: not to mention the waste of money, you have to pay all the drivers, when we could better serve the more distant places with these buses if a single driver could embark between 3 and 5 times more people in a tram or 10 times more in a metro.
are you really going to bring the money argument to this discussion? this is probably the strongest argument against ..
you don't seem to understand the employer of this amount when it becomes public money, it seems to lose the real value. especially when you factor in the city's small population!
and must i remind you that the "problem" of bus traffic is in a very localized area at very precise, very marginal times.
phew! do you want to know what costs society to build and maintain highways in quebec? and the parking lots, do you want to talk about it?
the money argument is [the best argument] ( that we can make in favor of public transport.
to think that a solo self-driving lifestyle is economical for society is the biggest cognitive dissonance i know.
so the roads cease to exist when you buy a tramway! sure!
i see you are in bad faith ... a 2-lane highway might be sufficient, but we have 4-6. shops and houses are further apart to make room for all the road infrastructure and parking lots. if we eliminate 20% to 30%, we can certainly eliminate 20% of the roads, or increase the number of taxpayers who pay by 20%.
do you have other arguments to the straw man as well?

[at the request of several, follow-up on the 10 questions of the #debatqc @iciquebec quiz of candidates for mayor of quebec. who got it right and who got it wrong?] (
[final results: smith: 9/10 gosselin: 8/10 rousseau: 7/10 marchand: 7/10 savard: 4/10] (
savard who thinks that the bus is free, it's a little insulting
i must say that i am not terribly further along after this debate. my decision is really not made. they all have something that i don't like
not strong savard
i missed the debate. have any candidates proposed a management like montreal? that is to say stop maintaining the city to raise the salaries of elected officials?
it's quite fluffy as a quiz, but savard's performance is not very impressive!
i find that unforgivable at a time when there is so much talk about the development of public transit in quebec. eille worse it's been a long time since it is more free there. it's not like it was from last week.
truly!
yeah, i was counting on the debate a bit to make up my mind. it missed. not a bad debate, but nothing decisive.
the questions about the bus and about the debt ... that was not strong though. i didn't really think i'd vote for her originally anyway, but it shows me that she's completely disconnected from public transit and for me, that's the priority.
will they invite the duplessis orphans to join them?
they invite everyone.
lol, the caq wants to forget about charlesbourg, fuck them i guess ... they will take their tank and will stay on the beautiful renovated laurentien hahah
thank you caq!
but what are the people of beauport doing to governments so that they are offered a tunnel and a tram?
the only release we want to see is when we put this divisive and unpopular project in the dark.
they vote caq at a large percentage ...
the only unlock that you want to see, nuance
i thought about it. i sincerely hope that is not the only reason!
honestly, if you think this project has significant support outside of the media and politics, i don't know what to tell you.
i will tell myself that it is to serve the super hospital ...
_bot maître capelo_ 
apparently you made a mistake, the correct conjugation is
i know**
and if you think that the population is overwhelmingly against the project, you listen to certain radio stations too much.
indeed, the population is divided on the project, but the majority still support it, according to the latest polls. do not mind ...
edit: oh! and not a self-respecting urban planner or transport specialist is against it. the lack of serious public transport in quebec prevents some young people from other cities / regions from wanting to move to quebec for their job or their future. the mayor was told directly by the so-called young people on a mission to encourage graduates of higher education to come and settle in quebec.
there is more than one reason. the first one would be that a big part of our jobs are really stable. a lot of people work for the government, so they don't lose their jobs during economic cycles. which helps other sectors have steady clients. it really does help us have a steady growth. we also invested in jobs in sectors that were growing in the last decades like video games or pharma.   
this is the positive side, on the negative side, we struggle to attract immigrant. because, first, the province limits a lot the number of immigrants, and second, the language barrier. an immigrant who doesn't speak french can find work in montreal but in quebec city it is really  hard.   
so to oversimplify, the growth of our gdp is too high for the growth of our demography.
"according to statistics canada, 94.6% of quebec city's population spoke french as their mother tongue. in addition, more than a third of city residents reported speaking both french and english."
before the covid times, i've heard a lot of friends talk about how hard it is for restaurants to find workers. 
my personal opinion is that the french language acts as a barrier to immigration, you have to speak french to move here (or have a kick ass job, or be with someone who does). i think most of the new immigrants in the last 30 years has come from small town quebec. this means slower growth, smaller labour market, higher demand for workers. hence, low unemployment.
at least, that's my 2¢
🎶la pcu, la pcu la pcu la pcu!🎶
> an immigrant who doesn't speak french can find work in montreal but in quebec city it is really hard. 
that's a plus in my opinion, that's why i moved from montreal to quebec.
>an immigrant who doesn't speak french can find work in montreal
isn't that illegal though?
i've had lots of anglophone co-workers who got jobs here (video games sector) and moved to montreal after 2 or 3 years because the language barrier was too hard to overcome.
feedback was always the same: great city, great coworkers and work environment, but its hard to just enjoy daily life because people don't really understand either english or their very rudimentary french.
furthermore, in the non-touristic sectors, some people are downright hostile to non-french speakers, which is quite embarrassing to be honest.
this is the reason why i decided to settle in quebec when i immigrated to canada. i knew that if i went to montreal, i would end up relying on english.
i also find quebec a more beautiful city.
illegal to not speak french?
not really. you can not make not knowing a language illegal for a job just because of the state.
that said, it is harder to find a job if you are not bilingual. it is not not is not impossible though since there are a lot of multinational companies now in montreal where bilingual may not be as important as the skills for a job. 
it is still low though and depends on the job.

i participate in a francization group to help people who make this decision.
you can't get a work visa unless french is part of the equation. to legally work as an anglophone only means you were born in canada and you didn't learn french.
yeah because of loi 101 ?
french is pretty hard to learn, especially if english is your only language. it can easily take 2-3 years of continuous classes until you're fluent enough to get around 100% on your own without using english at all. it's a crippling commitment for some people, especially if sometimes on top of that they're working long hours and adapting to a new culture/country.
the charte de la langue française and other assorted language laws don’t make it illegal for an employee to work in another language, they make it illegal for employers to make their work space inaccessible to working in french.  broadly speaking, if a boss and a new employee decide to speak italian to each other that’s fine, but if a boss requires that their employees speak italian to each other without a valid reason, that’s illegal.
i’ve worked for startups that needed programmers and hired recent immigrants who spoke some english and no french, it wasn’t a problem from the law’s perspective, but it was tough because not everyone else on the team spoke enough english to cooperate easily.  since québec city has a lower rate of fluent bilingualism, it’s sometimes harder for english-speaking immigrants without solid french to integrate to new workplaces until they learn more french.
and the "recent immigrants" have a valid work visa? when my la boss flew here he had to take french lessons and send proofs to the immigration department that he was actually learning french as part of his visa conditions.
you're right about the work law. but i'm under the impression that it works hand in hand with the visa stuff which acts like some sort of firewall. clearly there's a grey zone for anglophones from canada, but i'm not so sure for immigration. 🤔
thank you! this makes more sense. when i have seen this issue is servers not knowing french well enough to serve customers, and i misunderstood the fallout as requiring french employees, but really it’s requiring a french-inclusive work environment.
>they make it illegal for employers to make their work space inaccessible to working in french.
in practice, this is completely ignored in montreal.
the visa process is very complicated and knowledge of french is one aspect that weighs in heavily, but isn’t definitive on its own.  if you’re in a very high-demand job (like programming) you can get a visa with very limited french.
there's quite a few people at my work from all over the world who had no knowledge of french upon arrival (me included). 
i think to get a permanent residency i'd have to do a french course though
very general impressions.
team mj savard - the party that best masters the issues of the city as a whole (in its program anyway). but there is power fatigue that can set in and the team is different from labeaume.
qc forte et fière: ob cannot blame the chief, a former centraide employee, for not knowing the city and the region. seems to have better taken the pulse of the suburbs.
democracy qc: the leader is probably the most cerebral, but masters the issues of the city center very well. it happens less in the suburbs.
in the end, these three parties have platforms that are quite similar.
qc21: jf gosselin seems to have difficulty explaining what he wants for quebec. he took ease as an "opponent" but it is another game of "governing" ...
transition qc: ecologist party not bad on the left. very different platform on transport and accommodation.
citizen alliance: they shoot in a lot of directions, including saying that islam is a cancer (it's on their website). they also want a 3rd link that lands on the plains.
it looks like this. their websites are no worse. i would say that transition quebec has probably the most daring program and one that would create the most change in the region. the alliance and quebec 21 are more "right" and the other three have some points of divergence but offer a menu that tends to be similar ...
i mainly know the positions of tq. they are against the 3rd link, the only ones besides. they also want social housing to be built, new constructions of 5 or more housing units would all have at least 20% social housing. their program is really interesting honestly. [their platform] ( also, they want to introduce free of public transport. in the context of the climate crisis, i find that relevant.
do you know where we can consult a summary of the electoral platforms, a comparison would be even better? it's not easy with so many new people this year
thank you all for your comments, great to read you! nice group work.
good summary!
i would add that team mj savard and qc forte et fière are quite close ideologically and in their proposals. it is the leader who will make the difference during a debate, i believe.
is there a party that does not want a 3rd link?
i didn't know the last party but clearly i wasn't missing much.
the huge problem with tq is its boss who, in my opinion, is no match for others. there is a big lack of charisma in her interviews, she does not have the makings of a mayor of a large municipality. too bad, because its base seems to be well mobilized.
his main strategy was to put up election signs in the city. at 3% of voting intentions, if you didn't manage to stand out with so much spending, i don't know what tactic to use to win the election. an anti-3e-lien demonstration was organized a few months ago. we remember what was at stake, but not the party that organized the march. but yes, you're right, it is possibly the most original platform on local social issues.
as far as i am concerned, it is better to read the programs themselves directly from the source. it takes 5 minutes each and it gives an idea of the tone that the parties choose.
* [alliance citoyenne de québec] (
* [quebec 21] (
* [démocratie québec] (
* [québec forte et fière] (
* [team marie-josée savard] (
* [transition quebec] (
wikipedia is well suited for this. reference all party websites and identify the biases of each issue.
the radio-canada municipal elections site can be separated by region and gives all the relevant articles for the city concerned.
transition quebec seems to be the only party that clearly opposes the 3rd link. they want to reinvest the funds in a complete reorganization of the region's public transport network, in particular by transforming the old quebec bridge into a link reserved for public transport and active users.
démocratie québec rather wishes to make it a link dedicated solely to public transport.
the other parties all seem to support the 3rd link in one way or another.
edit: on october 13, quebec 21 announced that it wanted a 4th link. the quebec-lévis tunnel would become solely dedicated to public transport and a new highway axis would be built in the east of the city.
i read that the only party that openly opposes the 3rd link is transition qc (left ecologists, so not too surprising)
qc forte et proud and mj savard have said they will not speak out during the campaign.
démocratie qc and transition qc are against.
alliance wants a different 3rd link than the one advertised.
qc21 is super in favor.
edit: démocratie québec would like a 3rd link only for public transport in fact…
same thing here. when you need to defend the legality of what you say on your website's home page, things go wrong.
i offer 3 links. who says better
why would they not speak out during the campaign? it's a bit scummy.
vote for us is full of surprises!
the goal seems clear. 49% of the electorate is not in favor of the 3rd link according to a poll released today. not to comment on the issue while awaiting "further studies" is a way of not being officially labeled during the campaign, while the unofficial position of the party is pro-3rd link.
just look at the platform of the marie-josée savard team, which refuses to support the 3rd link, where it is nevertheless mentioned that it wants to "[p] rotect the quality of life of residents of central neighborhoods in connection with planning exits from the quebec-lévis tunnel [...] ".
it's a political communication tactic, but in reality, a vague position on the 3rd link is essentially unofficial support, at least in this municipal campaign.
on the other hand, during the federal campaign, the liberals' refusal to speak out against the 3rd link aimed above all to safeguard the seats of deputies joël lightbound and jean-yves duclos in the central districts, clearly knowing that an unfavorable position would be detrimental to them in the capitale-nationale region.
silence does not mean consent, but it is at least an indication that the decision, which is moreover already taken in the offices of the party, is not unanimous. we therefore prefer to avoid giving a sentence that opponents can quote, at least not before the election.
ouuuuuh i like surprises!
it's a bit like what labeaume did with the tram in fact.
meh. i find that insulting. it's taking us for idiots. assume your position.
absoutely. but ultimately, since there are few people who find themselves 100% in a party's platform, if they even take the time to read them, it's hard for parties to please everyone. so when it comes to very divisive issues, the famous "wedge issues", parties tend to be content with an artistic vagueness, to avoid losing a large section of the electorate.
this is an issue that we have seen in larger-scale campaigns, such as the federal elections, where the conservative party of canada must satisfy a diverse electorate. so when it comes to guns or abortion, we try to hide the message in footnotes to avoid making too many waves, so as not to alienate part of our electorate.
to be pro-3rd link, it is to put an cross, or to put in play 49% of the electorate of the city of quebec. for now, marie-josée savard is ahead of her closest opponent by 21% (36% vs 15%). why put these figures into play when she did not even have to take a position? as long as she is not forced to answer, saying nothing remains the best solution politically for her.
it's not much, but she loses my vote.
thanks for the answers and the prospect.
i'm curious, is the question of the 3rd link for you the question of the ballot box?
personally, i'm so sick of hearing about it.
this is one of the main issues for me, yes. financing a tunnel at a disproportionate price to promote urban sprawl is nonsense in my eyes.
> i'm curious, is the question of the 3rd link for you the question of the ballot box?
for me, yes. that and the tram. what would the other important issues be?
as long as it's not gosselin who comes home.
personally, i would have expected bruno marchand to be higher in the poll. if the trend continues, he will have my vote.
i heard marie-josée savard in debate. honestly, for a woman who was basically # 2 in charge of town, i expected more from her and i'm not at all impressed with her style.
jean-françois gosselin is not fit to lead a city of 600,000 inhabitants. but i believe that his presence is necessary at the town hall as an opposition.
mjs is the only one i have heard advocate for the revitalization of boulevard ste-anne and the establishment of an urban boulevard in place of dufferin montmorency. she will have my vote. maybe other candidates mentioned it but they didn't shout out loud. it's high time the eastern part of the city got its share of the pie. bin beautiful the marc-simoneau arena but there it takes a vision of town planning and especially access to the river for the population. it seems that i live in beauport ???
on paper i like the ideas of transition quebec. it's very progressive and it speaks to me. not really surprised that it's not high in the voting intentions, but so low it's sad :(
transition quebec had a 250% increase in its voting intentions in 2 months. looks like they're building a worse momentum with the ideas they come up with, i can see why. they will surely exceed the 20% mark by the time of the election. i wonder how many councilors they are going to elect. at least 2, that's for sure.
i don't have to watch too much, who should vote for if we are against the tramway?
it really surprises me. i expected gosselin to dominate.
i support marchand too, but i would have liked them to communicate a little more "ideas" and his vision for quebec.
there is access to the river from a place commonly called "the tip" or from the flats, but nothing more.
no one is talking about the revitalization of vieux-beauport either.
ish ... access to the river? from the party which wants to sell 15 lots to the private sector to build factories in maizerets and which is doing everything to destroy the bay of beauport, the only current access to the river?
the mass media don't talk much about it. it is especially qff (marchand) and qc21 (de gosselin) who are talking about them.
same here. their program is well developed, but with current intentions, i prefer not to divide the vote and run the risk that jean-francois will find himself in power.
by the way, if you're kidding, go read the [acq program] (
i hope they will have representation in the heart of the city, especially st roch to work with qs at the provincial level against the 3rd link.
you stay at home and you don't vote, out of respect for all those who endured the preparatory work all summer. one imperfect project completed is better than two unfinished projects.
gilles lehouillier
goglin is the only one who is against
what? truly?
same thing here, it was marchand to lose my vote. i had a favorable prejudice. but ultimately nothing particular in his plan, in the limit i find that the plan of jean rousseau is more punished. he cannot distinguish himself which gives the lead to continuity, savard.
250% increase? they are at 3% of the voting intentions. it will be a marginal party for the positions of councilors, no one is put forward and few have any real political capital. in st-roch, to my memory, the initial candidate of tq was crushed and presented itself as independent. nolin is a big size, lachance is well known in the neighborhood. i don't really see tq having more than 10% in the central districts, and that is where all the energies are put.
being in lévis wouldn't be too hard hehe
we are in quebec. people love to vote very right around here.
so i expected that with labeaume gone, the only other "noisy" voice in municipal politics would be the one that dominates. i'm glad to see that i was wrong
i have the impression that even the right finds it stupid a metro in quebec
i do not agree that it votes very right here. remember the orange wave of 2011 ... or the trend more to the left in the upper and lower towns of quebec and the surrounding area ..... however, i would be comfortable to say that the suburbs actually vote more in right, especially the south shore. in short, it's just your "very" that annoyed me ;-)
quebec is not lévis. if one day the agglomeration is unified, it would no doubt be a little different.
light rail*.
dig in rock the same
i have the impression that even the right finds it stupid a 3rd and a 4th link.
for pâté chinois and pouding chômeur, i suggest [la cuisine]( on st. vallier street, it’s a family style restaurant with a retro/kitsch decor that also becomes a bar at night. great staff and the owners are the nicest people !
if you want a classic poutine, i would had suggested ashton but fromagerie victoria got the first position with an intense poll on /r/quebec. i have to say that there's a lot more cheese curds on the fromagerie victoria one, just be sure to take pepper sauce or bbq sauce. the regular one is really watery. 
as for other dishes, i think the best way to taste them is going in small family restaurants. within the old walls (the tourist zone), you'll probably get a reinvention of the classics, not the classics.
you could try cipaille (sea pie), which is a eastern quebec meal (gaspésie/bas-st-laurent) traditional meal. it's not french in origins, but it's been adapted to quebec, using game meat (venisom, moose, etc) found here and potatoes, which was a staple of quebec cuisine.
i think le buffet de l'antiquaire sells some. don't know if they use game meat.
check out la bûche in old québec! traditional menu with a twist, fun decor and not too pricey.
you should try le pied bleu on saint-vallier. brunch and dinner is great, traditionnal french food with a québécois twist and a focus on homemade french charcuterie. great wines, and good atmosphere.
i know there's a lot of duck and rabbit on the menu at the lapin sauté. the restaurant is located in the very touristic petit-champlain.
thread somewhat inspired by this wiki article:  
i wish i was here from a few more weeks. i really like qc and the people i've met so far. but also i'd like to go explore montreal some (particularly schwartz)
coquille saint-jacques ! :d that’s my recommendation if you like seafood
for a more upscale menu, bistro boréal chez boulay is an incredible experience. everything is cooked with local ingredients, inspired by the boreal forest.
for the paté chinois, try the diner saint-sauveur. thing is, some of these classics are family meals type stuff, not really made to be delicious as such. the diner has a version that is imo true to the ingredients but presented in a way that is unlike anything my mom could ever cook, no offence to her. they used to have a pudding chaumeur too but it seems it is not on the menu online atm. patente et machin used to have one as well with bacon bits in it and it was amazing. for tête fromagée you can find it in a grocery store, its very cheap! i recommend eating it on sliced bread toasted in a pan, my dad also adds yellow mustard and another toast on top and he flattens it with another pan. i love it, tête fromagée is full of fat so the vinegar cuts through it and its very nice. you can probably find a tourtière at the grocery store too, i think the restaurant st-hubert have one on the menu that is also sold in grocery stores. foie gras is more french than québécois i think? you can try the restaurant le continental, prepare for a high price. imo its very overrated. for fèves au lard, we often call it "binnes" (as in "beans") and you can find it a breakfast places like cora déjeuners or normandin. we usually prepare it with maple syrup and eat it with a english breakfast type meal including eggs, bacon and toast. there are also cans of it at the grocery store. for the pot-au-feu and the civet i don't know, my granpa used to hunt hares and its the only times i've ever ate it. ahh and for poutine you can try poutineville, they have a good variety. for a classic one with no frills, try chez gaston also. if ever you come back during the maple syrup season (the end of winter just when the temperature goes over 0 celsius) you have to go to a sugar shack (cabane à sucre) everything on the menu there is all classic stuff. the most famous one is au pied de cochon sugar shack but its closer to montreal than québec city. i saw some "oreilles de criss" (crispy pork rinds) frozen at the grocery store, its not the same as fresh but hey, while you are at it! if you pass by a saq shop (where we buy alchool) ask for "caribou" and "coureur des bois", its the traditional winter carnival stuff. have fun and careful with your arteries, all this stuff is... not healthy!
for the pouding chômeur, try bistro sous le fort. they have really good dinner fare too. a bit pricey but so worth it. i recommande the salmon if you’re into that.
we stopped over an evening at the hotel at wendake. food was great! our kids loved it and tried deer, wild boar, duck etc. the hotel is beautiful!
do you mean tourtière as pâté à la viande or as the one from lac st-jean? if there is ground meat it is the first one. the second one is definitely better. i usually get it at the grocery store if i don't make one myself. not sure where you can get it in a restaurant.
so, we are all curious... where did you go?  what did you think?
pardon ?
i went last night and the pouding chômeur was out of this world. thank you for the recommendation!!
thank you so much!
intense
i'd +1 the antique dealer
cipaille is definitely my favorite traditional meal from here. not easy to find in restaurants and even harder finding in a restaurant where they make a proper one. one of those things where the best ones are made by your grandma :)
also worth noting it’s similar to tourtiere on your list.
fantastique! exactly the kind of thing i was looking for :d
i see the cipaille on their menu, but it is crossed out for some reason. is it a seasonal dish maybe? 
i tried this, but i thought it was ´six pattes’ as in six feet/legs/hooves, not cipaille 😂 can anyone confirm?
i walked by it, and it looked nice!
we were visiting last week and had dinner here with the kids. food was good! not fancy but hearty and delicious. pouding chomeur served in a maple strip can. 6 of us shared it and couldn’t finish!
there's better smoked meat in montreal than schwartz.
the main deli which is right across the street is better imo.
i do very much - where might i find it?
what a thorough response! thank you for sharing.  when i head back home i will be on a strict veggie diet but for now i am living it up haha
you’re welcome ! i’m really happy you liked it !
well, i didn't know what word to use to indicate that it had been commented quite a bit, suggestion?
yeah my grandma makes some using game meat my grandpa kills. it's our traditional christmas meal. takes almost an entire day to do but it's just next level.
no idea. i never trust online menus because restaurants rarely updates them. could be a seasonal thing, it's more of a winter dish.
it's an alternative name, "six pâtes", because the meal has six layers of dough (pâtes = dough/pastry).
a man of culture, i see. any smoked meat in quebec city by chance?
if you can't find a nice grandma to make one for you, they're fairly easy to find in the seafood section of most grocery stores (iga, metro). we don't see them often in restaurants sadly 😞
i just wanted to back up your saying
there are others, but i know phil smoked meat on rue saint-joseph. it does not have the cult status of the mtl smoked meat tough.
brynd on maguire is pretty good, though it's not as good as montreal smoked meat.
they have it at côtes à côtes near the sightseeing port downtown!
ah thank you! i misinterpreted.
hey man, you dont get much upvotes on your posts, and i aint in a position to give an award, but you do an excellent job and we appreciate what you do!
[deleted]
that record could be toppled tonight, still 25 at midnight. and that's at the airport, cooler than in the city. we're at the beginning of the longest heatwave so far this summer.
thanks!  it's a lot of work, but hearing your appreciation makes it worthwhile.
i think you misunderstood the statistic given by this post. we are talking about the "highest low temperature" here. each day has a minimum temperature. so, among all the days of august since we recorded the minimum temperatures, that of august 13 was the 3rd hottest.
it eventually dipped down to 21.1°c around 6:30am.
i think he knows it, maybe he wanted to say “to all those who say we still have very cold winters, global warming doesn't just mean always hotter”
yeah, bummer isn't it.
seriously now, we're experiencing weird weather since the turn of the century. while june remains pretty much as it always has been september is not chilly anymore. as a matter of fact over the last two decades the hottest day of the year occurred in september three times. it's at the point that i consider september as part of summer rather than fall.
the contrast of september vs october is very obvious. fall is very short here, only about six weeks and then poof! winter is here, and it's here to stay. four long months when people who aren't into winter sports or operating snow removal machinery rarely venture out of their homes.
for myself i loved winter. i operated a 360hp tvm the wheels of which were taller than me, and i',m 6' even. for those who don't know what a tvm is it's a very large and very tall articulated vehicle with a rotating platform in the cab. the platform comprises most instruments and, obviously, the operator's seat. rotating the platform meant that you were never in reverse. there is something exhilarating sitting way up in your snug cab in the midst of a blizzard,  knowing that nothing will stop you. nevertheless i had to retire six years ago at the age of 52 due to a bad back. now i find winter boring and too long.
in my future rental housing ad i will write: * 420 friendly *
do like everyone else and smoke it at night on your balcony.
r/vaporents
disposable vapes are very blah, especially at $ 70. invest a $ 200 (one time), take a good vape (i have the arizer solo 2 and i really appreciate it). no combustion, so better for your lungs. you will consume less because it heats up more slowly, so you will save money in the long run (especially if you consume regularly). you really taste the terpenes more than with combustion and yet it hardly gives off any odor! i have a small essential oil diffuser, i turn it on and i vape in my room, no problem!
\ + with a vaporizer you can use abv (* already-been-vaped *, weed already vaporized) to make edibles or oils / butters / milks ... with thc.
good day:)
take an empty plastic water bottle, make a hole in the end, fill it with bounce for the dryer pi blow your puff in it, it will smell the bounce in your apartment
my landlord at ste-foy had added this clause to the lease when weed became legal, but too bad for him i just started smoking under my oven hood;)
i have always smoked in my apartments in limoilou..a ste-foy also in fact ... they weren't really big blocks however (3 or 4 apartments)
a smoke buddy and chronic orange spray while puffing through a window, i have had several apartments and i have never had a complaint. i hope its gonna help you man!
vape d'huile is the way to go !
op, i'm late, i've just discovered the sub, but check in the maizeret district in limoilou or the montcalm district near sainte-foy. the apartments look ugly on the outside, but are super beautiful on the inside. costs a little more expensive in montcalm.
i have just moved to limoilou //// 3 days notice of eviction !!!!!!!!!! the world has driven crazy i had to type me a saaaaale seuvrage otherwise it was the street 🤔🤔what the fuck serious? ! i tried the bounce hood i even bought a kind of charcoal fucking bounce in quebec mix nothing to do
i told myself that it should exist precisely since it's legal because without it being complicated to know or what you can really legally without having a house. in which corner do you rent them?
dude i would like it so much. this is what i did at the beginning but apparently just having a container for the sqdc my neighbors felt it xd and the balconies are really close to each other. or what i am he clearly has no one who smokes and it smells really strong to them. as soon as i started to roll or prepare it in a one hitter i would hear people whining. plus i don't want to get out of my accommodation either. i almost visited another place (same company on the other hand) and he only tolerates the cigarette that the guy said. at least i just have to touch another year. i should px be mentioned that i am more suitable for seniors or quiet families with their kids if that doesn't help either. the more i work during the day i am not for lack of sleep for that no i want to be able to smoke a little when it does not try. like a little girl on saturday morning it starts a weekend
[deleted]
the best answer for sure, i'm an argo team, if not a duplex with a smoking owner ... or buying a house.
yeah, i'm not sure with cardboard walls that you can hear quite a lot. the more i have already tried with a candle made to hide the smell, the more the window open plus a smoke buddy. it wasn't long since i heard my neighbor upstairs wondering what was it that felt worse start to whine directly. xd i really live in a worse place for seriousness. by taking a quick little puff (so that he doesn't smoke escaping) from a one hitter outside with the smoke buddy. it was like i was using nothing.
yeah i would like that but my kitchen is drett next to the door not sure i could. but i am checking the vapors there are no worse deals and it doesn't smell too much.
yes that's what i'm checking the damn dropper at the sqdc it's worth nothing it's so imprecise that you never know what to expect. 50% of the time it buzzs not even xd
lol the advice you received was not good. you have to go to nlp first before you can kick someone out.
it's non-smoking accommodation in town, but what you smoke on your balcony, me and your neighbors, we don't care
i am in limoilou near the 3rd and 18th. lots of apartments for rent, from 3½ to 6½.
[deleted]
and it's canadian if i'm not mistaken!
naah does not buy her men, even the nordic rosee, her kalis nothing
yet made the men
ok but limoilou? beauport? is it possible in the corner of syllerie? my job is close to that corner
i can get evicted even if i smoke on the sidewalk as it seems on the ground. even just the smell can make me evict. it's mark black on white in my housing paper. worse, it wasn't just a can. when i went to the balcony. 5-10min i was waiting for the two neighbors upstairs to cry and hell for a good 30 min. i am just in front of the rue campanile if that can give an idea. not to mention that when i arrived i had a bag with all my things in it and just opening the window i was woken up by neighbors who shouted that it stank of carrion at 6.30am.
it depends on the dude i already had buzz which lasted until the next day anyway xd but i had with nordic dew. usually i've been taking thc 30: 0 lately. but like i said i look at the vapes like. honestly i miss the feeling of smoking too
he would not have obtained the termination immediately. unless you were really abusive indoors, it takes a lot for a judge to kick you out of your home.
no more trash than that, but most of the landlords, at least around me, don't mind anyway
the campanile is pretty much the worst place for that. just families or "little old people". there must not be many who are for legalization there ...
fyi, i don't smoke and i don't give a fuck when someone smokes outside, although the smell is not that bad, but i have already taken the bus with a guy who reeked of weed.
it was painful to stay close.
for people who have never smoked, it smells like skunks and they don't want to have that smell in their homes.
small random tips:
1. the young people from the school go to smoke in a bus stop in front of the school, facing rue senneterre, not many houses there.
2. a friend told me that the sqdc weed had a very strong smell that bothered his girlfriend. this was not the case with the one he "found elsewhere" than at sqdc.
[deleted]
bad spot indeed. i don't think i heard such a story! rolling one up and having a complaint.
ah men, i tried everything but i had to smoke a 30 to 4 day i had to stop even the broken coast did nothing 😮
idiot was indeed throwing 😂straight edge now so its just done right!
but where? it would be fun to know
yeah, i had quite a two week ultimatum to find myself a place so that's really my luck. there is a field (open space between two blocks) next to my house but i make it look crooked every time i go there because i am directly in front of their backyard. there is another place too but walking 20min to smoke 1-2 puff is not worth it. it's been a while since i bought it from the sqdc but what i found on the internet the smell was worse the more i prefer to stay legal. the guy on the bus had to get out of his house smoking without worrying about the pentoute bucane or there is hot boxer somewhere. i use a smoke buddy which absorbs the majority of the smoke and the smell while exhaling the puff in it so not too much of a problem on that side.
shit i still have a bong, you tempt me to go and buy a small 3.5 next week xd
> it's really complicated to put a tenant out.
i lived in a block where it's more old people and / or young family and there was a guy who was made sacred outside because his immediate neighbors complained about the smell of weed in the evening.
that being said, he was a problem tenant and it was probably the drop that broke the camel's back.
haha me too when i was still with my parents i had to take a break for at least a week to get back to feeling what xd i feel you. but it's been so long that a one-hitter hit will do the job en masse.
lower town
seriously, this is the 4th apartment i have in limoilou / st-sauveur, for sure it's not the high class, but i never heard anyone speak because i smoked.
yeah, i don't mind that for non-smoking accommodation it is quite easy to get kicked out, especially since when i called for smoking accommodation from the same company they told me that they were really strict about it even though you are supposed to be able to anywhere or whatever cigarettes are allowed by law.
this comments section is now a family picnic airw
low key, i don't see the point. isn't the rtc doing the job?
i would like to have opinions opposed to my point of view? maybe there is a detail that escapes me?
it's a shame that high-capacity, high-speed public transport is cool
in my opinion, the tram is just going to be useless, another multi-million dollar project that will bring nothing at all to the city.
will municipal and provincial elections take place before the project is well underway for economic rather than political reasons?
will citizens finally have the chance to make themselves heard on the subject and finally to speak out clearly so that elected officials cannot ignore the popular will and at two levels rather than one in addition?
i am cautiously interested and quite amused to imagine the reactions to labeaume since he heard the news.
thank you lego dad
it will never happen, let's see. quebec likes to think of it as a large metropolis when its population is similar to that of winnipeg
yes the rtc does not do the job. have you ever taken the 800/801 at rush hour? there is demand on the central roads for a tram. the rtc can therefore better serve the rest of the city with the largest corridors covered by a tram.
what are you missing? a few hours of reading .. we've been talking about it for quite a few years in quebec city, it's not recent.
i'm not going to question your age .. but it reminds me of the 17-year-old in my dec, who comes out that he is going to vote for the caq in the next elections. it was fitting that he was going to be 18 2 weeks before the election. he had a chariot, his parents had paid him, his parents who live together, at the same address, in a stable marriage with good jobs, had no trouble paying him a car, a license, private primary education until college.
when you are privileged .. then you are not forced to use public infrastructure .. you can imagine that everything is rosy.
i'm leaving your city .. your comment pissed me off somewhere because this is what you say: hey guys, i read nothing fucking all about the subject, eli5 chu too lazy to inform me even .
crisse, google search for jdq and sun articles, there are archives, then go back the last 20 years. or pay someone to do it, boy.
and that i would like to see you manage this city. you have no idea how complex it can be. the supplier market has transformed with the merger of bombardier-alstom. there are fewer players who can offer these services. and, let's try to forget the chinese. but given the context it wouldn't be surprising to see them in the portrait immediately. they are big players.
as a person who lives half and half in quebec and winnipeg i agree with your point, but ouch. :( don't underestimate mid-sized cities! we deserve a good public transport system too.
edit: i agree on the size comparison not that there will never be a streetcar.
and that there are negative people. you remind me of those who are for all that is against and against for all that for ...
in the last 8 years i have surely taken the rtc once?
okay then, i figured the 800/801 was okay.
i can begin to understand the need then.
was i just open to seeing other points of view because i'm open-minded?
the rest is you who made prejudices, but thank you for your “opinion”.
relax dudu, the world can be well informed when and how they want. report to be triggered on it? precisely, he does not see what it is for, he evokes it, asks for opposite opinions. then you happen to you and you scream that he should know? 😂
just because it's an important social debate for you doesn't mean it is for others. reddit remains reddit esti, if someone wants to explain it to him, he will explain it to him.
🤷‍♂️
the fact remains that he delayed the launch of the project, which was almost tied up before the pandemic. if it hadn't been for this, we might not be where we are today.
my two cents
by not commenting on the subject, i want to say that i needed to recover six times to read your comment
i just hope they have planned their finances well. it is expensive to build a tram. travelers must be there to ensure income
please don't vote.
you are crazy about asking questions without doing a little preliminary google search. yes, there are stupid questions.
then yes it purges me man, quebec, city of char, mentality of char, char char char char char. sorry to have feelings about things .. i must be a hysteric huh? 🤷‍♀️ not sorry for not being a complacent city dweller.
how do you know that? are you in the front row to know the whole file. speaking without knowing is the property of platform managers.
i believe that we can rely on accountants, engineers, architects, etc. who have to assess the estimated costs of the project. here again there are so many imponderables that having an exact calculation is a possible mission. where they succeeded is with the turcot interchange. budget and schedule respected.
please don't vote.
🤦‍♂️
hysterical, it comes with the tone of voice. i would have to hear you to find out.
in fact you reminded me more of an episode of road rage 😂
you may be wrong. fix a vehicle problem with more vehicles, blah. look at places with a high population density. are not much better and it's not a tank story.
the problem is rather that we ask everyone to do 8 to 5 outside their home. give them the choice to show up at the office whenever they want - no need for 100 homes and 100 offices, just 100 homes and 40 shared offices. we can see it with the containment that many companies are capable of.
your bus / tram problem, we find it quite ridiculous when you have gone through all the complications inherent in being a parent who does 8 to 5 while your children do 8 to 3. and i'm talking to you. not even daycare. a tram will not solve that, it remains a plaster until it stops flowing. spending 2 hours in traffic or in the bus is scary, but you have to ask yourself at the start ** if it was really necessary to move **? why are we moving?
it pollutes more! we ask the majority of people to spend cash to burn gas and pollute the environment, as a gang, in order to go and do elsewhere for 8 hours of time what you could do at home at the start ??? 😨
there you are going to tell me "yes but the tram ..."; well no, the tram does not scale either. he can't go * everywhere *. he completely ignores the reality of people who do not live in the city. look at montreal and the metro, pretty much the same game. it's great * when you're already on the island * and did that solve their traffic problem? well no. to solve their traffic problem they must suggest to people outside the island to 1) work from home and 2) go to the office if necessary at a reasonable time (depending on each person's personal situation)
anyway we move away. in short, there is not all on "google". anyway, we are talking about strategy, which is almost an opinion but based on our divinatory capacity. also, reddit is one of the nicest discussion platforms and people's experience is often worth a lot more than "your googles skills". you have the meta of the post which is collected in the post.
there you tell us "nah, go search the meta on google, if you comment it is because you know what you are talking about". it's cave. you are wasting time and energy.
same as an f350 caught in traffic 😂
bennnn i listen to the news ...
here is an example:
is that sarcasm? i was under the impression that it was a mess. it's been 10 years since the project started and there are still years
i was not the one who voted for quebec 21 then labeaume. i guess that's what you do. no more asphalt! more gifts for pkp! sabotage the rtc for a decade by doing absolutely nothing smart with it, then suggesting a streetcar plan a few years before retirement that he had spent most of his career undermining and sabotaging.
it is not i who make your city a host of emptying. i pick up trash in the street and bring it home, leave it in my bag. i took part in town planning and community projects on a voluntary basis because i believed at one point that quebec was evolving.
in the end it's a redneck hole, the first place in the west to have a white supremacist terrorist who gunned down a mosque, then there's still a huge portion of the city's population that doesn't give a damn about it.
yeah no, you're right .. i shouldn't vote in a gallic village election anymore. really unfortunate mergers .. it didn't work out in the end.
[
it is anne guérette whom labeaume was making fun of. it was radio x which supported labeaume and his cause.
i didn't vote for the fucking assholes.
bein as i thought, a pseudo-intellectual macho. the tone of voice ... you really bit the chauvinist. no wonder the caq is in the majority.
budgets budgets… projects of this magnitude a project of this magnitude cannot be resolved overnight. just think of the auto companies that take 4 to 5 years to develop a product. remember how boeing took to develop the 737max. yet he started from a known platform.
* this little generic judgment, based on a specific opinion, was commissioned by the diviner elsavè. *
i'm from ottawa but i've driven in montreal a lot and the turcot interchange had limited traffic and scaffolding already in 2010 when there was almost no construction.
i can understand the years to develop an innovative product like a car, but to renovate an interchange used by tens of thousands of cars per day and which is one of the great gateways to montreal? let's see
for you it's okay to call the world hysterical if they're not stoic and heteronormative jaded and disrespectful. you are a flat male then you need to dominate.
go get checked.
i am sorry that you are not able to measure in your head the extent of this kind of project. even as i bring new data i do not believe that you are able to separate things… good luck….
it was you who said that word 🤷‍♂️ i told you that it depends on the tone of voice that. it's like being angry, but level 2.
you have no argument to give me other than to tell me that i am a no good. * slow clap *
return to twitter.
i am simply making the comparison between quebec and the rest of canada and i wonder why construction projects are so difficult in your area.
you have nothing to come up with but banalities, hasty conclusions about urban development and the economy in the capital for the next 50 years.
immediately jumped to the conclusion that the tram is not a need, and that there will not be more and more requests ...
ihh boy, you don't understand what quebec's plans are for the decades to come. you base yourself on 2020 only to say that the customers will not be there.
i'm not telling you that you're a no good, you act like a no good. you're acting like an osti of a colonist chauvinist who thinks that if a discussion isn't sober like roger, it must necessarily be une folle'à'ginette. check your misoginy, that's all.
have a good month of mauritius pride.
you haven't really done a comprehensive review. i will only give you one. the streetcar in ottawa. difficulties do you want some here ...
last thursday i was listening to infoman and there was a report on the decay of our schools and they also mentioned that the critical school ratio had hardly budged since the caq was in power.
it is so sad to see this government favoring a $ 7 billion tunnel instead of investing in the education of our children.
exit from the tunnel at the height of the expo-city. do you mean we could stop the freeway there after all?
why don't we make the tunnel from latuque to saint-georges go?
nice! cross at lévis just down laurentien, practical !!!!
not for those who take laurentien to work in the city base. i imagine it will be even more congested.
good point! we will have to expand it is clear
pffff....
and the population? are we listening to her?
finally some good news! ideally, the passage will be free to maximize its use. it is time for the electrification of transportation to take place at high speed, especially in quebec.
since i am for the project, a resident of the city and a user of the rtc, i would say yes? ;)
i also meet the same criteria and am against it. why not institute a popular vote? i think that the solution would help to decide the divergent opinions like ours. but unfortunately this was never considered ...
i am always surprised to hear that people refuse to invest in infrastructure in their own city.
knowing in addition that if we do not take it, it will be given to another city and we will pay for it anyway.
i do not refuse that we invest for the city, far from it !!!
i say that the population could be more involved in determining the project. are there no other options possible than the tram?
almost all sectors of activity are now undergoing a change of approach which tends to involve more upstream projects, beneficiaries or users. gone are the days when professionals arrived with ready-made projects saying: hey, we thought that for you ...
and yes, like you, i also think that we had better take it anyway, but i don't think that we are already with a knife in our throats ...
1. the tram project was not done on a corner of the table as some radio hosts like to believe. specialists have been looking into this for years. and here i am talking about more than 10 years.
2. there were also several moments during which the population and organizations were called upon to express their views on the project: the call for briefs and the various public consultation sessions.
3. public transit projects are often funded by the three authorities: federal, provincial and municipal. so you pay in a way for projects elsewhere in quebec and canada. why should we have a referendum for our project in quebec, but not for other projects elsewhere?
for that, we would have to vote for someone other than labeaume on november 7th. here are the parties on the starting line so far:
- [team labeaume] (
- [québec 21](
- [démocratie québec] (
- [transition québec] ( (formerly option capitale nationale)
- [strong and proud quebec] (
note that the only party among them to oppose the tramway project is québec 21.
@ bikewander,
i tend to generally bring certain questions back to my field of expertise and my practice. it certainly has its limits, i'm aware of it, but it often helps me in my thinking. i have the chance to coordinate projects in the field of health and social services.
for your points 1 and 2: i already congratulate the efforts of specialists for having occasionally involved the population in the past. however, i fear that this is not enough. i draw a parallel with my field: there are several degrees of patient involvement, whether in care, research, teaching, organization of services, governance and development of health policies, in short in all domains (ref:  these degrees of involvement range from information and consultation (the weakest) to collaboration and partnership (stronger and increasingly desired). when choosing a high level of engagement, experience shows that one is not required to evaluate the engagement strategy, unlike a simple consultation. this therefore leads us to adopt a reflective approach (by that i mean that we must constantly ensure throughout the project, that we continue to meet the aspirations of the patients) and that can lead us to rethink the project. which is not excluded. this approach has been shown to be effective in the health field and is increasingly adopted.
if i bring the subject back to the context of the town hall, further consultations or a vote would allow us to get the facts straight. regarding the operational aspects of the vote, an electronic system would be quite appropriate and realistic (fast and cheap). the covid context has provided us with proof of this ...
for a subject that seems to divide citizens so much, i still think that a referendum would be the minimum. to answer your last question, my answer will seem ordinary to you, but why not in quebec? at least we'll do things differently and who knows, that will help change our habits
thanks bastou for the info! but is this enough to think that the majority of citizens are therefore for the tram. in which party do we therefore classify the apolitics? who knows on november 7, everyone would vote quebec 21 (implausible). but clearly, the question of the tram during the campaign will be a sensitive subject to bring together the electorate. we will therefore see if the positions will also be clear when approaching ... :-)
the problem with a provincial referendum on public transit projects is that we are still talking about essential services. as soon as we broach the subject, many get on their high horse because they feel attacked as motorists and do not want their taxes to finance this kind of project. however, an efficient public transport service is necessary if only for equity of access to services and employment.
moreover, it is obvious that the tramway project mainly concerns the citizens of quebec. so, do we get the whole province to vote on the project since they will all indirectly contribute to its funding? or simply the citizens of the city concerned?
> is this enough to think that the majority of citizens are therefore in favor of the tram
no, it doesn't have a direct link, it was just for the info.
moreover, some of them have not yet finalized their program, there is still time to become a member and vote to influence the program.
edit: i was rather talking about changing the party in power to have more transparency and give more importance to the voice of citizens in decision-making, not (only) for the tram.
i share the exact same fairness principles with you.
i will answer you just the citizens of the city. the inhabitants of the province will help finance the project, but the fact remains that as t underlines it is first and foremost the business of the residents of the city. i am not surprised because i know that my taxes go to the realization of other projects in other cities of the province, and that does not bother me.
> however, an efficient public transport service is necessary if only for equity of access to services and employment.
if you started your presentation by saying right away that it is for ideological reasons that motivate you, we would waste less time.
ok !
thanks again for the info
it already makes more sense to specifically consult the population concerned. in fact, i am for the consultation and the co-construction of a project with the citizens. after all, this is the target audience. it has to meet their needs and expectations.
on the other hand, this same population does not know all the mechanics behind the development of a public transport network. the experts are in a better position for that and we should listen to them.
i have studied and worked in the field myself and can confirm that unfortunately most people do not distinguish between their individual needs and collective needs in terms of transport.
bourquenic,
this sentence is not mine.
if however your remark is indeed intended for me, here is what i answer you:
it has nothing ideological what i propose, on the contrary we can not do more practical in a democracy! the people growl? let it be expressed by a vote! there is nothing more elementary ...
and as i explained at length earlier in the discussion thread, i have proof of the effectiveness of my approach in my daily practice.
sorry if i wasted your time
sorry for wasting your time. you weren't forced to read my “presentation”, however.
equity of access to mobility is only one aspect that makes it necessary to set up an efficient public transport service.
however, although i am of the opinion that the population should be involved in different stages of the project, i repeat that we must also listen to the experts who know a lot more about the subject.
your french is excellent! i bookmark this for later, never been to gaspésie but it looks really beautiful!
thank you very much, hope you will visit it soon
kijiji and facebook marketplace are probably the best. if you plan on using public transport, make sure you choose your location wisely. some locations are very well served whereas you'll need a car for other locations.
welcome!
the best way to learn french is to practice it, this is my advice
don't be afraid to speak french, people will appreciate and will probably give you advices.
marketplace for an appartment is great, 
join a team sport or activity where you can meet ppl and learn the language and the culture at the same time :)
start learning the grammar and especially the pronunciation of french right now. speaking with a local **isn't** the time to learn how to form a sentence. start by learning how to ask *how do we say x in french*, that's the very least you should know by the time you get here, or you won't learn shit.
make sure to check out veq - voice of english québec. they will help you find resources to make sure your move will be good.
good luck! and welcome to / in quebec. ;)
thanks! i'm checking both sites. 
do you know if there are any outdoor hockey rinks in the limolou area? seems like a good area to live.
good idea !
i have been learning since april. i understand the basics of grammar. this is the oral communication i need.
i live in halifax, we are not talking about francis here. i learned on the computer, but i think immersion is important.
it's vieux-limoilou that is a great place. if you go to maizeret, which is very close, it won't be the same. it won't suck, but it won't be the "limoilou experience" people are usually talking about.
for public transportation, the best is to be close to the 800 and 801 bus routes.
there is one in parc bardy or parc ferland, but depending on the spot there might be another a lot closer. check out "patinoire" in the "équipement" column on this page.
i'm sure you can find some people to practice with if you research a bit. check the bulletin boards of libraries or the language department of colleges and universities in halifax. there are [acadians] ( in nova scotia, among others in chezzetcook, near halifax.
>for public transportation, the best is to be close to the 800 and 801 bus routes.
those 2 cross limoilou from north to south. there is also the 802 that crosses it from east to west, and can connect with the 800-801.
thank you !
i've been using those resources since april, thanks! i've done courses through a local university as well as alliance francaise. 
yes, there are people who speak french in nova scotia. it's just uncommon. pockets of acadians can be found in isolated areas of the province. as i've said, i'm interested in immersing myself in french culture. that's far more challenging to do in nova scotia.
i know, i meant just to practice a bit before you get to quebec city.
welcome to quebec. your written french is not badly correct. keep it up.
for friends and girlfriend, i don't really know what twenty-somethings are doing about it now. in my time, we went out to bars and everything happened there.
are you a student or a worker? because friendships often go through the people we meet on a daily basis. invite your coworkers for a beer after work or organize suppers.
the promenade samuel-de champlain is great for chatting with new people, however it is better to plan to go there with someone. it is close to montcalm. let me know if you want us to go.
what area do you live in? you work or?
thank you!
ah! i don't drink alcohol. is there any other option for telling people?
> are you a student or a worker?
worker.
montcalm and deloitte.
"have a beer" is an expression. yes that usually means going for a drink of alcohol, but in a broad sense it just means going to a bar / bistro / pub / restaurant after a shift to socialize with colleagues.
she is an anglophone who speaks french, which is remarkable. should still not ask him in addition to speak mongolian
good strategy, you have nothing to gain by going there and you stand out by refusing the invitation.
it's not really its target audience either ...
same thing when a politician doesn't want to go to everybody's talking about it.
she is above all a * francophile *.
it's not her crowd anyway, she has nothing to gain from it except hate.
the one who has to lose is marie-josée savard, given the policy of quebec city to no longer buy radio x advertising.
you are completely right. in fact, savard has everything to lose, on all points. i have the impression, as here, that she wants to free herself from labeaume as much as possible, but at the same time to surf on her position of dolphin. she started to refuse debates ... it's not the best tactic when you have a big notoriety deficit.
i will be really disappointed if she comes back personally. i don't think we're going to be well served by her. labeaume had many faults but he took his job seriously.
still surprised that chicago is in position number one!
uncontrollable cesspools of murder will do that to real estate.
much more violent on the other hand.
for hairdressing, it seems to me that the hairdressing salon at the desjardins pavilion at laval university makes it a specialty. at least that was the case a few years ago… but i don't know if the show is open at the moment because the pavilion has more or less been transformed into a vaccination center…
ebony qc in the st-roch district. i don't know if they also have a make-up service, but i remember some friends talking well about this hair salon.
there is shea on chemin ste foy, near duplessis. i don't know anymore because i have never been there or had a comment, but they even have a website!
indeed, it makes sense. i'm 6 months away from my marriage so it's time to change. thank you! i'll check if they're open.
radio-canada did [a report] ( on the owner. it seems that this is the only hairdresser in quebec to specialize in natural hair for black women (more traditional hairstyles for this hair texture).
edit: there was a small segment [on the radio] ( -racism) too.
oh good! the owner will be able to give me recommendations for makeup too!
thank you!
if you ever run out of guests, i'm available.
crime is such a good article. it makes me realize, that even though i'm aware and all, from the height of my privileges i sometimes forget that we have a lot of work to do in terms of racism in quebec.
excellent journalistic work !!
and she's super thin too.
haha let's say that in times of covid it is rather the opposite problem.
ah yes i imagine. in any case, congratulations and i wish you a beautiful celebration :)
do as in california: you commit and you turn on the yellow orange
if i remember this intersection correctly, the light flashes green to say you can turn left. if it is solid green, reverse lane cars have priority to drive straight ahead as normal.
if not, treat it like normal ... wait until there are no cars driving straight ahead. so that you turn left ...
you can also take franck-carrel in the other direction to take charest.
i take this intersection every day, several times a day, i rarely saw anyone having trouble turning, just wait until the cars opposite that turn right and go straight have passed then you can pass at the same time as those leaving for the city center
edit: the entire intersection is zero ... the storage lane before the light is too small, the bus stops are zero, the lights are the problem you raise.
you go to the center and wait for the end of the flow of tanks to turn left. it's easier the other way around.
you can take cyrille-duquet and come back to take charest afterwards. but usually there aren't that many cars blocking you and it should be possible to find a place to turn left.
i agree with you that this intersection is really not superb. you can always call 311 to give your opinion. the people who manage the light cycles will receive your comments.
friendly thread for a very specific traffic problem. i approve of this content. :-)
i work in the industrial park and i pass the 4 times a day with a truck, in the opposite direction everyone almost turns left or right, you walk quietly and as soon as there is a hole you weigh on the gas. the world are used to it and pay attention.
if there are a lot of people you walk in the middle of the intersection and when it turns red you go.
i read the title and i immediately knew which intersection you were talking about before opening the image! : p
do as in quebec and turn on the red
exactly, there are so many cars passing that it is impossible to turn left. you collect yourself to be at the stop and to block all the other cars behind which they even block those which turn to the left in the other direction.
yeah, not that it's impossible to do, but when you're not from the city, especially when you live in a small village, it's rare to see stuff like that and it's confusing when you follow a gps .
at worst, continue straight ahead and take cyrille duquet and take the motorway entrance further
the worst is st-jean / honore mercier to the left. the world engages but ends up getting stuck because the left turn accumulates and ends up blocking honors mercier. it honks in ciborium.
you advance to the equivalent of the solid ground. you wait for it to be released, you block no one you turn left.
yes it is clear that when you are not used to it it can surprise. and especially that sometimes it is also very badly indicated, we do not see the boundaries of the lanes, etc ...
bypass seems the best option in my opinion, you lose 1 or 2 minutes but less stress!
[deleted]
you can no longer do it, it's now forbidden
not to the tim hortons but to the pepsi distributor
in addition you have a nice reserved lane to turn left a light earlier.
at worst, if you turn towards the tim hortons, there is a roundabout where there is the irving, so you can retrace your steps and finally make the desired left turn.
obviously, it's bad-shit like an intersection, but hey ... quebec gonna quebec, i guess 🤷‍♂️
well yes yet another post on the tram but things have been moving a lot in recent days.
here is an interesting point from the article:
> unlike the section of the route going from cap-rouge to saint-roch, where a tram will run every four minutes during rush hour, commuters taking the section between saint-roch and d'estimauville will benefit from a eight-minute frequency.
it's funny i would have thought the opposite.
i can't wait so much !!!
indeed, i imagine that can change!
[deleted]
in my head i read cap-rouge a ste-foy. i still think of the ste-foy exchange pole.
but casually i think there will be a strong clientele in limoilou
the best thing to do is especially to take the trouble to order directly from the restaurant and not through uber eats, etc.
in what is different, we really like the goblin tankard ... it's not the cheapest, but they have their specialties. they have ready to cook that comes with an old french style written parchment, it's fun to read. we ordered their brunch for easter, it's delicious!

ultra fresh cheese (the cheese factory is opposite), a delicious menu as basic as you want or as fucked up as you want. the sauces are good.
when you go get your poutine the guy has a great dj setup and plays a good beat.
it's my poutine of choice and my favorite comfort food during the pandemic.
do you want to encourage the restaurant or local entrepreneurs?
we look as much as possible for small local restaurants or quebec chains and we vary the restaurants. it's our way of encouraging and trying to stay as local as possible.
for the night owls, normandin delivers lunches at all hours, they have a good selection of take out stuff and because our government is stupid they deliver reasonably priced alcohol after the unnecessary fucking curfew.
ashton
old duluth
yup
oh i've been there a few times and it was great, i'll add this to the list, thank you!
you've either eaten there or this is some high level marketing. 👊
sweet jesus. i feel like the government is doing it on purpose to squeeze people out of the restaurant industry.
at the start of the pandemic, they came with a plague doctor mask! it was perfect ! i think they stopped but i don't know why.

wow i wasn't expecting an answer from you! don't let go! you are awesome !
there’s a lot of good advice here.
i’m anglo and i’ve lived here my whole life. i’d add that the majority of folks in qc are some of the nicest, most accepting people i’ve ever met.  it’s a city where you can generally make eye contact and say hello to strangers without fear.  people don’t walk around this city with their eyes glued to the ground. they interact. 
as others have said, it is good form to make an effort.  always start your conversations with a cheery “bonjour!” – and then ask “parlez-vous anglais?” to give them the heads up that you’re not quite there yet for a conversation.   i’m sure apps exist for your phone to help translate what you can’t yet.  effort gets way more points than proficiency, and is more appreciated than you could know.  on the other hand, the lack of any effort can really turn off someone who was helpful at first.  sounds like this wouldn’t be an issue for you.
1. most people, especially around u laval, will speak english. some people might be kinda rude about it.
2. $750/month would give you lots of options. $1000/month for a nicer/newer place.
3. honestly i don't see many indian people around the city. i think there's one small indian grocery store around limoilou. there are way more options in montreal, but i'm not indian so i've never really gone looking for places. qc is pretty white.
4. much snowier and a little colder.
also, definitely check out the voice of english quebec (veq) whose entire purpose is helping anglophones in qc, newcomers in particular.

if you lived in toronto, for the same rent price you paid, i think you’re in for a pleasant surprise here in quebec! 
every advices here are valid so i’ll just add that you should google the indian restaurants and go meet the owners. they’re all family run businesses and i’m sure they’ll be happy to give a few pointers. 
or go shop for some clothes at [exo shop]( in st-roch. the owner, jay, is indian and just an all around nice guy! he set up shop decades ago so he knows *everyone* in quebec, i’m sure he’ll be happy to give you a few pointers as well!
lots of good info here. i would like to add :
for renting : 
* unlike in ontario, most apartments come without appliances. this is not a huge hurdle, but something to take into consideration. some nicer/newer places will come «semi-meublé» (with appliances).
* consider living in saint-jean baptiste/montcalm/saint roch/limoilou for urban living, diverse food options and general city excitement. rents can also be cheaper than near ulaval. as a comparison, we recently moved to limoilou and are paying 1200$/month for a huge 3 bedroom apartment with all the appliances, parking and access to a yard. living by yourself, you could find something interesting well under $1k.
for indian culture/life/food :
* yeah... there aren't areas of town where the south-asian community lives and many people here have not met people of indian origin. you'll get lots of love, but it may be hard to find community. i don't think there are hindu/sikh places of worship either.
for the climate :
* basically snow on the ground december to early april. a lot colder and snowier than southern ontario, but lots of activities to get into. invest in a nice pair of boots.
* ac is not really necessary here, so apartments that have it may be overkill. 
final thoughts :
* québec city is more affordable and relaxed than toronto. we're a city of less than a million where most people live comfortable middle-class lives.
* visiting toronto feels like going overseas for us, so i expect you'll feel like you immigrated to a new country. you'll love it, but i think you'll understand why many people refer to quebec as a "distinct society".
good luck with your move!

1. should be ok in town. quebec is a touristic city.
2. should not be a problem. lots of options.
3. there are a few indian restaurants so there must be somewhat of a small community i assume. but dont expect much. look online maybe?
4. not worst but longer. probably 1-2m longer with snow and negative temperatures. quite windy between jan-mar also. but lots to do outside in the winter.
most important imo is to be aware you will be paying way more taxes for the same gross salary that you would have in to. i would advise doing simulations on line.
hi my friend,
you can get by with knowing partial french, but people will greatly appreciate if they see you making an effort to speak our language.
as other people said, appartment are cheap compared to toronto.
no one really cares about your race. my so is of another ethnicity and no one has ever commented on it nor made her feel apart. show that you try to speak french and you'll be welcomed with open arms by most.
winters are worse than ontario. a bit colder and longer....but climate change is taking care of that...
regarding item #2, quebec has a slightly different approach to a) measuring the size of an apartment and b) lease periods. 
a) apartments are measured in number of rooms and bathrooms are denoted by 1/2. so a 3-1/2 would correspond to 1 bed, 1 bath, kitchen/dining room living room. a 2-1/2 will likely have the kitchen and living room combined, with 1 bed and 1 bath. 
b) leases typically start and end on july 1st, making canada day some sort of local moving day (we celebrate our own "national" holiday on june 24th). you won't have any issues finding something in october, but the july 1st date usually means that leases are renewed in january/february, and then the available apartments are advertised in march/april as everyone gears up for a **massive** game of musical chairs. 
regarding transport, the university is generally very accessible, both by car and by bus. our local public transit isn't as well developed as toronto's, but the metrobus lines (buses 800-804 and 807) are a great starting point. as others have mentioned, you absolutely need proper winter tires, and winter gear in general. we get the occasional snowfall in october, and probably into april as well, with plenty of large snowstorms and cold days. we also don't close down as quickly when it snows... usually, unless visibility is drastically reduced by blowing snow, everything is open. spring is also a weird concept here:  i’d describe it best as a season of "melt", since the temperature can get into the teens and there will still be snowbanks on the ground.
also, as a general rule, the culture in quebec is different from the roc (rest of canada). i've never really lived in the roc, but my parents were raised in southern ontario and have definitely experienced something of a "culture clash" moving here. quebecers tend to identify themselves with their province a lot more than with canada, and hold quite strongly to maintaining our language, even though they generally will be very happy to practice their english with you.
lastly, i’d definitely recommend immersing yourself in québécois french as much as possible. it's rather different from "international" french, so much so that many movies have two separate french translations, one for quebec and one for france. radio-canada (the french branch of cbc) and tou.tv would be great starting places if you want to listen/watch stuff just to get used to the accent.
my apologies if any of this is incoherent... i’m on mobile lol! i hope this helps; feel free to ask any more questions. quebec city is really a lovely place!
you'll eventually encounter racist people, both for your ethnicity and language, but you can just ignore them. like some are really dumb, my english friend got spit on his shoes by someone in the street because he asked for a lighter in english. lived here or maybe 4 years, happened maybe once a year.
winters are awful, i can't compare, but they're awful. wind is especially annoying because it packs the snow and then it's difficult to shovel. definitely get a snowblower if your driveway can fit 3 or 4 cars. get ready for multiple storm of 30cm+ of snow per winter.
and welcome to quebec 😊 hope you'll enjoy your time here!
i visited as an english only speaking tourist more than once and had zero issues with language or race.
did this on my phone, formatting may be off.
1. you'll survive with little to no french, especially in the sainte-foy area (probably the most diverse area in the city being next to the university). so all your examples can be done with ease. just see it as living in a foreign country, not everyone will be able to help you in english, but people will try to help nonetheless. 
for the long term, you'll greatly benefit by practicing your french, people will respect that too. however, know that some may switch to english to be polite/help, it's not to be mean, but you should just keep at it in french as much as possible. you'll probably be having conversations in french and english, hell i still have to throw in some english words sometimes when i pull a blank. it's all good. by the way, check out assimil for learning french, really great. 
2. prices have gone up in qc like everywhere, but i have found it to be one of the cheapest/most reasonably priced cities i've lived in. check out facebook marketplace, centris or duproprio to get an idea of prices. check out saint-sacrement, sainte-foy boroughs (quartier), montcalm and sillery is not as affordable.
3. i don't think there is a large indian community here compared to mtl, to or even halifax. but on maguire in sillery (near sainte foy), saveur de l'inde is the best indian food i've found, looks family run. i tend to use spices provided by la route des indes sold in different locations, great amount of choices that you may not find anywhere else. there is la epicerie international amine in quartier saint-sauveur that is mostly lebanese, but may have some specialty ingredients. i'm sure there are choices nearer in sainte-foy and sillery. i have also found it easier to find paneer in my local grocery stores, which i thought was pretty sweet.
4. if you don't like winters, they're bad but usually very sunny (although sunny days can be the coldest days). if you like winters, then they are great. try to find something that brings you outside to enjoy the winter, it's the best way to pass through it. lots of hiking to be done, which takes relatively little investment. get a good winter coat for urban walks/commute, wear lots of layers and a shell jacket for hiking. never go out without gloves and a tuque, scarf is always a plus.
hope this helps, cheers!
1. not speaking french will be an annoyance for you but not a complete roadblock. most people speak english to an extent, especially younger generations. learn how to ask in french if the person speaks english or if someone speaks english that could help you. it can be seen as rude to just start conversations in english when we don't expect it. it's polite to greet in french and ask to switch.
2. appartements are so cheap here you don't need a studio, but price for a studio could range between 450 and 1000. there are decent 2 bedroom appartements for 750. by the way when looking for an apartment, here we count total rooms and not bedrooms. bathroom is half. so 4 1/2 is 4 rooms including kitchen living room and probably 2 bedrooms (and a bathroom). i lived in waterloo and apartments were 1.5-2x more expensive for the same thing, for comparison. 
3. there are indians here, there's restaurants and all, but the city doesn't revolve around racialized neighbourhoods. everyone and everything is mixed up. the communities are more abstract than in a geographical location. there are communities. they will help you. but you should open yourself to the concept that the culture here is different. we don't "hang out" with "our own" specifically. 
4. the weather here is very similar to waterloo but with a lot more snow. a few degrees lower in the winter. similar in the summer. the snow changes some things for dry vers though. you need quality winter tires, not all season. you need an actual long stick windshield scraper.
1- for french start with the basic, bonjour, merci, salut etc. i knew a guy who didn’t know a lot until he met a girl then he learned french so fast!
2-check other neighborhoods like limoilou or st roch. go check it out before you sign a 1 year lease.
3-i don’t think you will find authentic indian food here but maybe some good groceries, worst case scenario is you’ll have to go to montreal once in a while, the good part is if you cook good indian food people will love to join you because québec is a foodie place where we love to discover new stuff
4-winter is bad when you do nothing, when you dress appropriately and mostly do some winter sport then winter can become your favorite season. i find winter so magical.
there is also other really good comments here.
check r/quebec
honestly? move to ottawa. it's close enough that if you need to come here for a meeting, you can drive. ottawa is small and quiet for the most part and has good indian food. the indian food here is not great. the butter chick is sweet for chrissake. probably a way better south asian community there as well.
1 you should be ok with using english although i highly recommend learning a few basics sentences in french (you know the usual tourist stuff, like how to order foods or ask for directions etc.) 
2 the rent for those kinds of apparaments should range anywhere between 800 to 1200 depending how well located and new it is
3 the fact that you are indian shouldn't be a problem although i don't seem to have noticed a big indian community in the city (i'm white so i might not be the best to ask that one)
4 i couldn't say how worst are the winter compared to southern ontario, but they might be a little harsher and longer here
if you ever want to talk or practice your french feel free to hit me up!
3. i'm also an immigrant (latino) (m21) and lived here for 10 years now. i surround my self with a lot  of different ethnique groups, but i have to say, the one quebec city has the least of is probably indian. the only time you will ever see sikhs or hindis here are in touristy places during touristy seasons, mostly coming to visit from ontario. having visited and stayed in different parts of ontario there are a lot more there than here. you will see some middle eastern people but the closest you can see is probably a very little amount of pakistani and a few nepalese. there are some indian restaurants, but i honestly doubt there authenticity, though i have never tried them i shouldnt judge. i havent seen or heard of any hindu places of worship in quebec either. but if you are staying in saint foy. it is one of the more diverse areas of the city.
besides that you will jump into the occasional racist from time to time, but i cant lie i do worry your experience will be a little worse, since the general person here has had very few to no interactions with indian people, there for more biases. 
also with the language barrier/difficulties you might meet the general person that talks to you like a five year old that just immigrated to canada and asks you dumb questions, like what you think about snow.
thanks to every single one of you for responding. definitely, a lot of valuable information in here, and although i was checking the comments from time to time, i would need to go through all of the comments again in a focused setting while taking notes to absorb the entire information in a more organized sense. i am very grateful to all of you for the detailed replies and i understand that basic communication in french and willingness to learn more by immersion will make do for carrying out basic survival tasks - which was my biggest fear. so a big relief on that. regarding the community and social life, there might not be an indian community, and residents for the most part are very nice to each other irrespective of ethnicity is also pretty reassuring. although, i am prepared for the occasional bad experiences, and that is to be expected if you are treading into unknown territories and stepping out of your comfort zone. i am definitely up for the challenge :) also, i think i am a decent cook and if i decide to make the move, which i will try to settle the debate in my head a couple of weeks - i would love to cook for all of you lovely commenters some delicious indian recipe (could be butter chicken too, even though i myself am vegetarian). you guys are the best :)
quebec city is definitely more francophone than montreal but it’s still a tourist city so probably you could get by. 
i live near université laval which is in sainte foy and my 4 1/2 is 1k a month. you can get a 1 1/2 for like 560 $ 
la cité universitaire (the area near université laval) is diverse and has people from all around the world. if you live there you can take a membership at the peps which is the university gym. 
there are no southeast asian grocery store that i know of but i know the walmart in place laurier has an international food section.  
some other things to know : 
you still have to wear a mask in most places 
-there will be a vaccine passport starting september 1. (université laval has a vaccine clinic) 
-you need to have a medicine insurance, if and only if you’re not covered by your employer or your partner, you have to register to the public insurance regime. 
-driving laws are more strict, but in sainte foy especially near université laval, the bus coverage is great. 
- don’t forget to register for the upcoming federal elections, 
- you will also need to register for elections quebec, because there are also municipal elections upcoming.
best advice i can give you ; dont.
anglo living here for the past year. still learning...slowly. it's coming.
"hello, i just moved here, and i'm still learning french. do you speak english?" is what i use when i can't figure it out the french.
agree with all the above except that you can expect our winters to be several degrees colder, a couple of months longer and with much more snow.  
i'm basing this on the fact that every single year when my friends in to start posting their burgeoning gardens, i still have several feet of snow that needs to melt before i can even see the ground.
it depends where you've been.
sainte-foy is less of a touristic spot so one can assume there might be a tiny bit more language barrier than in vieux-québec.
nevertheless if op is willing to put on the work for some basic french and follow some of the advices gave in the comments, i really don't think there will be any issues.
i've lived in qc, montreal and ottawa, and agree that ottawa is a decent mid-size alternative.  it's cheaper on rent than toronto, but still way higher than quebec city. you would be robbing yourself of an opportunity tho, i think.
of the 3, i've always preferred qc for the friendliness of the majority of folks.  it is, for sure, not as diverse, but it does offer its own cultural experience and is not as lacking in diversity as it used to be.
looking forward to hearing more about your adventure. do let us know when you get here.
i remember a friend moved there and he was bilingual. he said it was tough.  
to be honest, if you want a challenge (language, culture shock, potential different treatment due to race), then go for it. but be prepared to move out of qc city and to montreal at least. which will still be a challenge but it's a much larger city with a ton more diversity.
also - in toronto, you don't need hardcore winter gear, here, you will.  
and i'd say that montreal and qc city are veryyy different from each other. there's a huge amount of indian population here, in mtl
i absolutely adore the fact that people downvote this. do what you must fellow redittors!
i do my signage with my hand all the time and i'm not afraid to practically stand in the middle of the street when i'm not feeling safe. we have no choice at times in quebec to impose ourselves so that we are noticed. the worst is the car doors. the world does not look when they open the doors.
drivers in québec city are shitty. they don't stop at pedestrian crossings, drive too fast in residential areas and aren't kind to cyclists. :/
it is a rule which is to be followed also for those who drive: "to drive for the others".
i don't cycle, but i would keep the same mindset if i did ...
there are cyclists who take the tour de france too ...
true dat. just hit a few mirrors when they are too close :)
when i moved in montreal 25 years ago i was riding my bmx and i learned really fast how to kick mirrors of taxi drivers, and also found another useful thing about ulock hahahaha have you ever seen a dumb ass trying to get away with a lock on is car wheel hahaha
i always worry about the doors, i guess when that's an issue i should just move to the middle of the road and ignore the angry drivers behind me.
that's what happens when all the city's developments have been car-friendly.
people tend to say that about drivers in whatever city they live in, but it really does seem like it's something different here. it's like a mix of stupidity, ignorance and aggression. the amount of unnecessary honking and red light-running i consistently see at certain intersections is unbelievable.
so what ? cycling is both a sport, a means of transport and a leisure activity. all types of cyclists have the right to be on the road.
oh and angry they are. but when they are angry at you, they do notice you so that’s a plus haha.
we're talking about the city where a popular radio host suggested drivers run cyclists over because *that's what they deserve*...
totally, i am a cyclist myself! my concern is more when a group does not share the road.
for now
what are their plans for urban densification?
not disclosed yet. we are very early in the countryside. with 7 candidates (plus the mayoral candidate) and a first electoral commitment, transition quebec is two steps ahead of the 5 other parties registered with the dgeq in quebec city.
their program has just been voted in congress yesterday (sunday), this announcement was on the sidelines of the latter. it should be available soon on their website. in the meantime, you can get an idea with [their values] (
good morning! you would have more success on r / quebec in my opinion.
i replied that i learned english at school but in reality it's more: music, films, books and interacting with english speakers.
are you irish? either way, you express yourself very well, and good luck with your thesis.
what does this question mean?
do you consider yourself french at all? *
oh yeah, trinity college! it's so beautiful dublin :)
i completed the questionnaire! good luck !
i think we are not allowed to post this kind of request on r / quebec!
i will keep this in mind when analyzing the results - thank you very much for completing the questionnaire! :)
yes, i am irish! and thank you :)
i think she means: do you consider yourself french in france?
yes i love the city despite its flaws!
thank you ! :)
ah good i do not know! i answered anyway :)
yes that's it. my french is not perfect so i'm sorry for the mistakes!
if it's possible to rephrase the question, that would be a good idea!
it's done now - thanks for your comments! :)
it's a funny question anyway. why would we feel french? it's like asking an american if he feels english in england.
well, a lot of americans would say they are irish, for example, despite their families having been in the united states for several generations, so i guess i wanted to know if there are similar feelings among quebeckers, especially because the culture has remained so strong. but i'm sorry if the question was a little stupid. i'm learning :)
"do you feel colonized?"
ah ok i understand. i don't think you will find it again, it feels like quebecois not french;) maybe more among italians in montreal for example, or some cultural communities
we don't often hear about slavery in quebec because it was not as widespread as elsewhere in america. it is very simple. that doesn't mean there weren't any.
i also had no idea that webster is / calls himself a historian. me be interested now.
it is encouraging that.
it is a direction and an angle on racism and slavery in quebec which is much more in accordance with reality than any speech coming from the united states.
i have a "problem" with the term systemic racism in quebec pcq if i look at it from the us point of view, it doesn't work.
we don't have jim crow, red lining, mass slavery, segregation, kkk, etc.
but his point seems more to be that our historians have put them aside. which is quite reasonable.
and that slaves have participated in the establishment of our society. nothing to say about it either.
so yeah. nice.
pffff hahahah
tsé when you have absolutely nothing to say
he studied history, at least a baccalaureate, maybe a master's degree.
so it is the roc. nobody talks about it. we only talk about “underground” rail and society has forgotten the rest
are you talking about your comment?
elaborate?
oppressed blacks
white oppressors
end of the discussion
the guy is frustrated because there are historians.
lol are you a little in denial, a lot in denial or passionately in denial?
thanks for the initiative!
i think one of the big challenges is going to be keeping this up to date. i think it will take some sort of exercise to review the suggestions on a regular basis (say every 6 months).
keeping information up to date is tough!
the tourists ask questions about the sub because they want a tourist gfe type answer with the locals of the place. it's more exclusive and less drab than a wiki. (even if the wiki is a good idea).
:-p
could we just put a quick link to quoifaireaquebec or another such site?
if we don't want to be pissed off, we can also directly link the [quebec page on wikitravel] ( ...
we could also put a link to [what to do in quebec] (
pretty much. when i visit a new city, i'm very happy that reddit exists, it allows to have real references not passed through the mills of marketing, agency and all the way.
of course it would be in the first page of the wiki, or we could also put a direct link in the automatic message which would also have a link to the wiki.
and one also to [quebec city.] ( ^^^ osti ^^^ que ^^^ j'haïs ^^^ the ^^^ name. i find that the section * what to do * offers not worse activities.
i think that would already be a good first step. like the other user said, it can be pretty heavy to maintain. has the number of tourist topics become too high? are we trying to lower that?
hi, i think not everyone goes to this sub so much to find friends.
i suggest that you see groups linked to activities that you like on facebook pages.
dsl i do not know more, i am an old man who has not made a friend for 10 years
dsl for his but it's “we want” / “who wants” and it's not “someone wants”!
anyone seriously wondering "is this going to fix the problem?" gets the same answer; no.
all the studies and expert opinions confirm it, it is unanimous.
but we listen to the ginos in pickups who vote for the caq instead!
it's because it's not white or black. it takes both.
all studies confirm that the third link will * make * the situation worse. but yeah, we shouldn't listen to experts and science, we're talking about the land of garbage radios anyway.
but not a fucking tram, we're not in 1837
how do you want to make the situation worse by having it circulate in a circle around town? seriously your "studies" i've read a few and it's often based on hogwash. the real problems are the ubiquitous roadworks, the mediocre bus transit system, the bridges that are already basic and inadequate, and all the tracks that meet at the mouth. many of these people go to lévis. they wouldn't be there with a 3rd link. and let's say that taking public transport from levis with a 3rd link will already be much more attractive since, having done so for a long time, it is endless in the moment. stop thinking what you think and see the bigger picture. a streetcar may not simply be the best possible solution and perhaps the current 3rd link project is not quite perfect either. but one does not exclude the other. it's gray!
tramway => 1837
pont => 2037
> but tse, we shouldn't listen to experts and science, we are talking about the land of garbage radios anyway.
hmm hmm
what we can no longer do today is debate without getting into emotion and whining.
as if there weren't any smarter solutions than this shitty technology. always binary in our world. always that 2 possible solutions has a problem: p you make me laugh a lot.
eventually, when the answer has been given, several times, over 40 years, you have to know how to admit that you were wrong. the "debates" will not change reality.
what are you advocating? that we all live in lower town and work in lower town and fuck the rest of the world who have to cross to get to their jobs? they have as much right for the situation to improve as you and they have the tram and public transport, in their context it does not work. your studies are crap. and don't come and quote the science if you can't even argue.
climate change 🎉
ironically, most people here are climate change deniers.
in 1913?
sorry, but not true!
3 of the top 5 are last 10 years.
1913 was just 1 year, you have to see the trends
half the city listens religiously to a bad imitation of american right wing radio.
outside of the city's inner buroughs, everybody is anti-vax and a climate change denier
i wouldn't rely on this table for trends.  this only shows 1 stat for a handful of years.  quebec city is getting warmer, but this is just a table of trivia.
quebec city has the highest vacination rates in the entire province, maybe country. what the fuck are you saying?
i am saying most people here are jeffn fillion worshippers and complete idiots
so your definition of most is less than 10% of the population?
by the way jeff fillion the bad anti-vaxx is vaccinated lol.
you know his vaccination status, you re a fan of his...proving my point
for sure knowing a public personality vaccination status make you automatically a fan. nice shortcut ;)
you go to cosmos and order his burger-à-jef like 90% of the city do every saturday night.  admit it, you are a fan.0
when you listen to jeff fillion's intro, you can hear him say that human effect on climate is like a person pissing in the ocean...it's an old classic. 
i have worked in various govt agencies and private companies as a consultant and 3/4 of the people (usually shitheads from the suburbs) go to work in the morning, listening to that shit and they believe each and every word coming out of 98.1 or 93.3.    it gets even worse in the low income population.  anytime i walk by a construction site, workers blast radiox and their anti-everything bullshit.
quebec city is a great place to live, but the people are by far the worst in the province.  it's tolerable when you live downtown in old neighborhoods but outside of those, you guys have the worst collection of shitheads in the province.   everybody here thinks the city is massive like tokyo and think the nordiques will come back.  i bet you're the founder of #jaimaplace and that you are friend with clotaire rapaille
>taking fourth place is the city of quebec in canada. quebec scores well in most categories, notably for their great tolerance of free speech **as well as the cheap cost of a macbook** and rent. the city also offers good levels of safety.
quebec: poutine & macbook!
wow 💪
it will be the best proof that a real 2nd link is really necessary in the region ... (without saying that the caq project is the best idea)
it's true. there are many solutions to try to resolve this problem, including improving transport links between quebec and lévis. but, the caq project is definitely not the solution. we need a link that facilitates travel between the two cities and that will consolidate the links between the two cities, but while unclogging the road system. the caq project to totally miss the mark.
i really liked this [video] ( which does not necessarily offer a solution, but which highlights this dilemma.
bonnardel is so cringe in his answers ...
yeah lol, talk to not answer like 99% of politicians. he's pretty much saying that their 3rd link project is based on electoral promises. if he really wanted to please quebec, they (the caq) should have fulfilled their electoral promise to reform the voting system.
it's been ... 13 years since i last had television in my life. it's funny to see pierre jobin with a lot of gray hair and wrinkles.
however, in this interview they have a good point, the golden age of news reports is over. i see him in the future bringing the news closer to the deus ex: human revolution. a bot that dictates text 24/7.
personally, i find it difficult to take a step back from the tv news, too much emotion to be objective. i believe that rad (not radio-canada, but radio-canada's "laboratory" on social media) has a good formula for presenting the facts or opinions they present.
after 28 years at the helm of the tva québec news bulletin, @pierrejobintva is taking his leave. the téléjournal québec host @savard_bruno met him a few hours before his last bulletin.

oh til, thank you!
they have a youtube channel. strongly recommended!
this is all personal experience and anecdotes.
i've lived in multiple provinces, and so have many of my friends. i'm originally from the east coast (maritime provinces) and have lived in alberta.
with regards to health care, what you are describing (in my opinion) is a canadian problem. the maritime provinces have a hard time keeping prospective doctors that are studying at dalhousie or attracting some from other provinces. there's a reason the maritimes are working so hard to keep covid-19 cases at zero, the healthcare system can't take the stress like québec, ontario, alberta or bc (these are the provinces with the most well functioning/well funded healthcare system from my understanding). ubc, mcgill, dalhousie and western are among the best med schools, but quebec also has an excellent french medical school system. the healthcare system (in québec) is just bloated, has had horrible "reform" and a lot of doctors are at the age of retirement (among other problems i'm sure). there is also the issue of too many small communities spread out across the province, which is a canadian wide problem. this is difficult and costly for the healthcare system.
i moved to montréal as a student and now am residing in qc. personally, i would not go back east for the foreseeable future. i think quebec has among the best quality of life in canada, and personally don't mind paying for taxes to fund more social services. majority of my friends that have lived in other major cities in canada have preferred their experience in montréal. i am very much enjoying my experience in quebec city as well, although it took time to go all in with my french to really reap all the benefits (culturally and socially speaking). i feel privileged to speak french so that i can live here. i do enjoy visiting friends in toronto, but do not see myself living there. i think bc is the only province that could tempt me, although it is fucking expensive and far from family. alberta doesn't interest me outside of it's beautiful landscapes/nature.
the maritimes are great, i love the ocean and the culture. but outside of halifax (which does have a high cost of living and not so high wages, even relative to mtl), the services are lacklustre. pei is beautiful in the summer (have a lot of family there), but the province is a big village (socially no privacy) and winter sucks (nothing to do), there is also the islander culture. if you're not born on pei, you'll never be an islander (although, that may change eventually). new brunswick has some nice coastal towns, but i would never live there\*\*\*. i prefer the weather in quebec a whole lot more too (compared to the maritimes).
i feel les quebecois often feel like they have a high cost of living but aren't well serviced, have the shit end of the stick. i usually don't say anything, but seriously, it amazes me the infrastructure, culture and services in quebec. it's not perfect (\*cough cough, corruption), but the best i've seen and a lot of passionate people working to improve the situation.
\*\*\*edit: nb is a province that is hostage to big industries. the "mafia" of nb is the irving family. the province hasn't changed in many many decades, and any reform is threatened by the irvings and other industrial corporations. it's a industrial province, st john's could have been a beautiful city but it's been poisoned by and killed by industry. moncton is meh. the rest is farmland (mccain farmland), vast wilderness, and military. the acadians are a beautiful culture and the native culture is slowly becoming rediscovered (what is left of it is being preserved, celebrated and built upon), this is what makes the coastal towns nice.
my grandfather went to quebec from tunisia, his main reason was:
we speak french
we aren’t actually french
our economy wasn’t too brocken like the other french speaking place that aren’t france.
this is because he didn’t learned english correctly at school, he had to learn arabic the morning, french the afternoon and at like eleven years old, english for one hour the morning. this meant he had to go either to an arabic country or a french country. but he really hated the french for having colonized his home, so it needed to be another country. quebec wasn’t a colonizer, it was a colonized region that had gained independence. so he went here in hope to find work. he left behind his religions (except the ceremonies for the same reasons an atheist celebrates christmas). that’s what makes us a good place to go. to those who didn’t learn english, to those who want to find a place to work and live, we can help. they won’t “take away our religion once they are more then 10%”. they will be grateful. and it is just a good thing to do, every lives count.
i don’t know if this is still going to help; ...
i moved here not long ago (i’m acquiring my canadian citizenship somewhere this upcoming summer ; i hope*) first lived in québec city (with my family). i’m naturally more of francophone since i’m from a country where french and my mother tongue were the only official languages until like 10 years and then quite an anglophone (really can’t say i’ve got any problems whatsoever with this language) because where i’m from, we’re surrounded by anglophones and we’re part of that economic community, therefore had to add english in our daily lives and as an official language too. i actually loved it being in qcity just for the sake of being hired literally anywhere (not to exaggeration though i’m referring to student jobs) because i was fluent in english and in french! i learned indeed how we paid a lot of taxes compared to other provinces but; also learned that it pays back a lot more than in other provinces: i have friends in toronto/ottawa , edmonton and calgary and others in vancouver and they’re paying hefty amounts for their college tuition as any other place in north america whereas for literally the same level of education (or maybe higher/lower depending..) i’m paying around 6 times less than that (not lying: a friend is paying around cad$8,000 in toronto for the same college program as mine and i’m only paying around cad$1,000 in montréal; yes i had to leave my comfortable parent’s house and be by myself for college, it’s been 3 years now...). and we’ve all had the same legal status. as a matter of fact, when a student is not a quebec resident ( like living in ottawa and studying at université du québ en outaouais in  gatineau has an extra charge on their fees !). and the other thing i noticed was about the healthcare system: they all told me they have to wait at the emergency for at leat 5-7 hours on average and it’s the same here as well. the difference i have pointed out was about the something i need to cross check again which the assurance-médicaments from ramq ... that covers the big part of the costs of medicines you’re prescribed and go buy at the pharmacy, (sometimes can be free and not the same case in other provinces = i think it’s due to a local consensus that is made in accordance to what matters for that timeframe and obviously is not the  case in another province ) just all the medicines a person would averagely need in a lifetime and for some reasons it’s a little bit narrowed down to some medicines in ontario! i’m personally taking a medicine every day and when compared to others in vancouver, i pay 7times less a month. ) 
the other service i know of and that would make things easier for a family is the childcare service that is always available (nonetheless it’s always being « reformed » ) for parents who wish to go to work, they then can leave their child to a subsidized childcare establishment and will pay only the basic contribution and the rest will be covered by the government (.. through taxes ). and i could not point out how much of a hard time it is with paperwork here. like when you have to go get something done with service québec... it’s really not that easy/fast. i hear in other provinces they are getting things done quite faster when it’s on the provincial level. i’ve heard about all other major laws and services that are very beneficial and that wouldn’t be available if you were in another province but it’s not really that you’d need them all yourself even if you paid for them.  
i don’t really know why but -to me- the government have put up a lot of services to make it a little bit even for every québécois to be able get the minimum . then that might be the explanation to why things are too hard to get. (too much to handle...?) 
montréal (the city itself, the island) is really cheaper compared to its north american counterparts and the 3rd in canada after vancouver and tdot . hence explaining why almost half of the population of the province of québec is living in the montreal metropolitan area. 
i just like it here for a simple reason; it’s the number  one university city in canada (and the world they sometimes say). 
the weather is same compared to other major cities on the east coast. vancouver’s is way better than the rest.  the potholes are a nightmare for drivers and parking lots, and one-ways, and always always always always ... constructions on some road you just used the day before and have used it for the last years. once one is opened another one is closed and... i can’t say this sufficiently but it’s never ending to see constructions and cones all the time you drive in mtl. but; the métro network/service is very smooth and very reliable. 3rd busiest in north america but also neatly organized and connected to light rail trains so the different shores and the upcoming rem ( réseau express métropolitain)fun ride. 
and if you don’t speak french, you’ll get along very well in montréal. just not to undermine the importance it is given here and if possible actually, start to learn/speak french. the vast majority of the montrealers will never talk to you for the first time in english. you will hear a little to zero english when you walk in the streets (well not in westmount though) but trust me; almost every person you’d stop for help or anything will be able to help you out in english. just don’t assume that speak english, ask first. 
and that only on the island. the rest is mainly french only. the government has been very firm on the status that french occupies here and some big companies had delays in their operations because the government can’t allow them to work with english. 
in other cities in canada you might find the bilingualism as well in quebec city a little bit and more in ottawa and more importantly also in fredericton and moncton. (i loved the one month i stayed for the university of moncton though you clearly i could feel some less vibrancy as i’d thought. ) 
to sum up, i personally prefer to stay here unless it’s for visiting. i think the taxes are  high but that’s why i’m getting a lot of other services at lower prices. very just think it’s depending on how u prefer to live.
i think a lot of systems in qc are broken. they have long bureaucratic trails that don’t function well, leading to a lot of delays and confusion. job security is so strong here that people often feel they don’t have to do their jobs, because there is almost no chance they will be fired. i find customer service scenarios very stressful because people tend to be both unhelpful and unpleasant. the taxes here are the highest of any province. if you are a super high earner or a super low earner - that works to your advantage. but trying to build meaningful wealth when you’re somewhere in the middle is very difficult. i’ve had a couple of minor health problems and the health system has been a nightmare to navigate. i’m from the uk originally. though the nhs is pinched and certainly isn’t perfect, i never had any issues like this back home. i also didn’t have to check up on administrative staff on a minute by minute basis to make sure the ball was rolling. the housing is cheap but it’s also built terribly. i have lived in several different buildings while living here - there are almost always problems. especially with neighbours and noise. i say this as someone who is generally quiet and respectful at home. my current downstairs neighbour harasses us with complaints. but it’s not her fault. the building regulations in qc are so shoddy that we can hear each other sneeze. the price of food is higher than the west of canada, i believe. and we also don’t have a huge portion of time to grow our own produce within, since it’s cold for 6 months of the year. rates of depression are higher in quebec - which may explain why it’s hard to find bubbly, fun people to hang out with. all my friends here are internationals.
wow, thanks for the great comprehensive comparison! how about ontario? i mean, i know you mentioned that you wouldn't move to toronto, but i imagine you were referring to the city itself. but what about the province in general, compared to qc? you mentioned some of the problems in the quebec healthcare system, do you think that aspect is better in ontario?
your (grandfather's) story is very wholesome! i'm glad to count your family as fellow quebecers!
that's a great story! i'm happy your family found here a good place to move to!
no problem! hope it helps.
i'm not sure about the state of their healthcare system, but toronto is one of the giants internationally in medicine and science. so i imagine ontario as a whole has a healthy amount of staff to support whatever infrastructure burdens may exist in canadian healthcare. can't say i've heard anything bad. and honestly, toronto is a fantastic city, just not quite one i personally feel like i'd like to live in for more than a year (nothing but a personal feeling though). but if you'd rather live outside of a major city, ontario has many large communities/smaller cities (ottawa, kingston, london, hamilton, mississauga, thunder bay, etc) that can offer a lot of commercial and social diversity and a great quality of life. it's also a huge province, so there is a lot of nature to offer as well.  
worth making a road trip this summer if you can. or at the very least, shoot some questions to the ontario subreddit.
hi,
i'm an american student there from new jersey.  tuition and rent for a nearby apartment is fractional of that in the us.  we're talking 7000k$ us per semester, and about 500$ for rent in a studio nearby the campus, living on campus is like 150$ a month but it's basically just a room and apartments are pretty much the same price of dorms in some schools in the us.  there is no meal plan at the school.
it is very reputable worldwide, a very old french-speaking higher education institution that will take you in with open arms even if your french is not 100%.  i did the summer immersion program and continue 1 french second language course with my regular bachelor's program. (french second language is my minor).
quality of life in the québec city region is amazing, especially if you have a car.  there is so much nature, and mountains and even beaches if you go out like 2 hours up the saint-lawrence river/estuary. it's a lot more calm than america and québec city is pretty much a giant suburb.  summers get really hot and are super sunny, one could compare the month of july to say may or june in socal, it gets 90 degrees easily here.
the school does not have the same american state school party scene attitude.  many people here seem to morseo enjoy smaller parties or dinner parties even. they seem to be a lot more serious about their studies, especially since with cégep a lot of those party types get weeded out.
cégep. if you don't know what it is, it's basically community college but mandatory.  instead of senior year, they graduate in junior year and go to cégep which is 2-3 years and do 3 years of university. being american i, and probably you will need to do an a prep year (année préporatoire/scolarité préporatoire) basically a semester or 2 of basic classes to take to get up to speed with the qc university system. it equals out to 4 years like in america so no worries.
my advice to you.  study french now!  today!  you're gonna need to make up for years of french in 1-2 years to be able to succeed. you can do this!  i am doing it and it's changed my view on the world and made me find a new happiness and i wish that for you as well. we are very few here, us americans, but those who do dare to leap to québec and take on the challenge are a special few.  here's my video describing what it's like here.
hit up my dm with any questions if you decide to apply here! bonne chance!
hi and welcome,
i went to université laval. its a great university with a very large campus. there are many activities to attend and a great sports culture with lamy gymnasiums for all activities, from swimming to squash, to weight training. 
dont expect to find a "college culture" like you see in american movies. there are parties but mostly organised by student groups. i dont think there were student groups named after greek lettres like we see in usa. a lot of people, like me, just went there to study...so im a bit boring i guess.
people are very chill and thankfully political correctness is not a dominant way of thinking. people won't be ostracised for expressing an opinion "out of the norm". people are generally open to discussion.
as for the price, i cannot speak for a non québécois, but i know its gonna be a few thousands per semester. for québécois its really really cheap tho.
as for the quality of éducation, i always felt it was top very good. i easily found a job right after my bac and everyone around here will recognise a diploma from laval. i was not the best student nor did i have the best grades
what would you like to study?
laval is the main university in quebec city. usually we rate a university's reputation in regards to the faculty. laval's law, medical and some engineering faculties are very well seen in canada, its computer science is average, etc.
i have to warn you that if you do not speak fluent french, you will absolutely have a terrible time. they take off points per french error on every essay you will every write/ on some exams! they are not accommodating of the fact that you are learning french because they just simply don't care. 99% of the population is francophone and there is minimal diversity unfortunately. it is also be nearly impossible to make friends because the locals stick to themselves. the party scene is not like in the states, you really have to know people to have fun. the city is very beautiful, but i would do my research before coming here. if you really want to study in quebec, i would suggest the universities in montreal, people are a lot friendlier there and accepting of others - a fellow anglophone in 4th year at ulaval that had to learn the hard way lol
thank you so much for the information! i really appreciate it! every single shred of this information is so valuable for me and every single person reading this, and i just want to thank you for taking your time to write this response.
out of curiosity why would an american student wanna study in a french school? 
you made me look at my school from a different perspective. while i dislike many things about it, it's nice seeing some positive points.
i like how you describe summer without peeping a word  about winter. btw it is a huge campus and there are underground tunnels between buildings which is usefull in the winter. it gets cold and windy.
cuddly naughty good description!
it is heartwarming to read this. hoping that you stay with us, my friend
your journey is impressive  and i’m totally jealous. love qc. we are (were) there frequently from maine. keep up the great!
is it mandatory to learn french?
while i’m not 100% determined on what i want to do once i graduate, i’m seriously thinking about majoring in it.
not a problem. i always get excited when other americans are interested in laval and québec city. glad i could help! :)
just to experience a different lifestyle in a different language after 18 years of the same anglo-american monotony.
yeah haha. the long winter although magnificent, is worth the beautiful amazing summer
no problem, i love this city and these people. hope to stay here for good!
thank you!
pretty much. it's a french language school with french language requirements, if you pass their mandatory french test than you don't have to. if you're there doing research for a phd and you come from another country than i think you have the option to do it in english in certain domaines. in short, if you going there for undergrad, french is mandatory being that it's a french-language school.
as someone who went to cegep and then ulaval in it, maybe i can offer you some insight.
it in cegep will make you "work ready"  by cutting the bullshit and go immediatly to programming principles and they will tech you as many programming languages as possible / real life situations you can come across during the three years program.  students after the program are high in demand and many won't bother going to university after this.
ulaval it program is (or maybe i should say it was, i finished more than 10 years ago so maybe it's different...) more focused on research principles. they will teach you how to think, what math principles are working behind the scene, etc. expect a lot of mathematics classes. if you enjoy those, you'll be served. they are fun/real world work related classes, just not the majority of them.
i still enjoyed my experience and i really liked the campus. i was lucky enough to find a job on site so i spent most of my time there.
sorry, can't say much about that since i'm not in it. but, if you want more information, just it me up.
you'll find the concept of major doesn't really exist at ulaval, but if you want to chat send me a message i did comp sci there plus a machine learning master's degree.
you’re the best! 
you are the best!
oh okay you
thank you
thank you
always that. once a citizen sets out to do so, the authorities are sticking their noses out.
it reminds me of the story of a guy who planted pot in a pothole that had never been repaired, and the pothole was plugged the next day.
i agree with you, but the city was not at home and, according to the article, we still do not know how to dispose of the snow without damaging the tracks. i just hope cn isn't going to jump on it and ask for public money if their level crossings get damaged with salt and machinery.
do not forget that you always have insurance and authorization stories in there .... it's nonsense, but often they wait for it to become more important or more visible to the public because it justifies the risk
sign!
another reason that is not named is that it messes up the sleep schedule, especially for children. it makes parents' lives even more difficult during transitions.
it is hard on pets such as dogs who have to adapt to time changes that they do not understand.
expanding your circle of friends means expanding your field of activity. find other social activities. volunteering, hobbies, classes, interest groups, etc. you have to get out of your comfort zone. at worst, you discover a passion that you didn't know you had so it's not time wasted.
where did you find the viking and outdoor groups for people 40+? 😁
personally, i have already volunteered for an event called the délirium ludique and i found it to be a really great place to meet new people. people are open to welcoming strangers to their tables (they even came to see us for help finding a stranger who could join them). of course, it's just once a year and, to make matters worse, it literally just happened at the end of the week, but i advise you to follow their facebook page for next year! there are surely other activities of the same kind also during the year.
also, sports leagues are good places for that. i met people by joining badminton, tennis, kin-ball (it was so hot !!!!) and volleyball leagues. the advantage for the first 2 is that you don't need to register by having a team. i do not recommend the more "training" stuff like spinning, it does not promote exchanges.
finally, i do not know what is your field of employment, but i have been in literature and i am now in computer science and these are two fields where there are all kinds of events (trade fairs, conferences, conferences, etc. ) where you are called to meet new people.
good luck! :-)
what do you like to do in your spare time, apart from sport?
facebook groups are your friends
if you are athletic, running clubs are great places to socialize while playing a typically individual sport.
if i were you i would try running clubs. there really are people of all ages ... if you like running of course.
although quebec city is my hometown, i only have one friend that i have met in another region who lives in the corner. i came back to town a few months ago to escape the housing crisis where i lived. in short, i will have to find people with whom to play dungeons and dragons, cards or go and talk while walking on the plains of abraham.
it's crazy how difficult it is to meet people in a city of over 500,000 inhabitants. i will have dinner occasionally at place de la cite if someone wants to join me.
i know that. but practical, what would you suggest?
celtic festival highland games may be what you are looking for.
i believe the dodgeball league is still looking for new players
doing work in my twin, tending my land, gardening, seeing my friends, cooking, going for a walk in town, cultivating myself by reading anything that interests me, chilling on reddit. i also like going to the city library and visiting the museums in the city, but again, these are solo activities.
like which ones? from experience, the facebook group events i attended mostly attracted people 40 and over.
thank you for the information! i must say that running is not my favorite activity for example.
is this something you've tried before?
> volunteering, hobbies, courses, interest groups, etc.
it pretty much covers everything. the goal is to spend time away from home, with other people, doing a group activity.
i'm not sure if you're looking to meet new friends or meet a partner, so it's hard to be specific.
there aren't a lot of group activities in there! i understand that you are having difficulty.
personally, i really like board games to meet people, if you're interested you could see if there are events organized to meet other players, like revenge. it is sure that with the pandemic it has possibly taken the edge….
we have several points in common.
and all of these activities can be done with other people. well yes, even read, hehe!
have you tried a group of citizens from your neighborhood?
thank you for the information! i'm not much of a board game player, but i don't hate it either.
do you think it's possible to join a group of strangers for this kind of game?
and you on your side, how do you go about meeting new people in the 25-35 age group?
practical-practice, what would you suggest?
as far as i know, citizen groups are rarely made up of people aged 25-35. unless you have one for me.
i know that before the pandemic, la revanche sometimes organized evenings for single people who wanted to play together! i don't know if they still do.
i regularly go hiking alone, from time to time i go with colleagues.
read bah ... either you participate in a reading group, or you are lucky and you have a friend who enjoys reading next to each other. it's happened to me before with an ex, and it was really nice hehehe hehehe: p
i'm telling you, absolutely everything in your list is done solo, with two or more. the difficult part is finding these people ready to support you in your activities. you must have some in your friends. otherwise, i imagine you will find it eventually. : d
i think you would be surprised. i see from time to time people who post to say that they are looking for the world for a sporting outing example
thank you for the information! i imagine that you need to know a few games before you start playing with others?
i understand what you mean, but that's not quite the subject of my original post.
i am looking for solutions to meet new people, to be less alone.
i am on a few fb groups in my neighborhood and in my arrondissement (on the outskirts of cité-limoilou). i don't know which part of town you are in, but here let's say that the average age is higher or they are families.
hm well that always helps a little! :)
don't you have clubs at your school or at work?
do you like conferences?
there are discord groups on several topics.
regarding gardening, you have collective gardens, environmental groups ...
the city offers group classes and activities.
there are federations and organizations that organize events.
i can even make a list for you.
yes i like the conferences. but for gardening, i have my own square at the semi-detached and i'm afraid of having my crops stung in a community garden 😂
i'm late, but at laval university there are a lot of muggle leagues.
i feel like i wasted 10 years of my life breathing so much smog in a summer.
but we had a great spring (may & june) and a superb end of august!
it doesn't surprise me. we had a late july.
am i the only one who finds it a little annoying that this englishman invades the subreddit with his graphs / table of values about temperature, winds ...
what does my language have to do with anything?  this subreddit clearly allows posts in both english and french.
im racist against the english
it depends on what you want in life, to be honest. and also your french (or willingness to learn it.)
i've been living in quebec city (technically lévis, on the south shore) for years and also work remotely. i love it. cost of living is cheap and the city is great for me and the family, but i grew up in big cities and we wanted a change of pace. we're a family so the nightlife doesn't matter to us.
i also chose to come here instead of montreal because i thought in montreal i would end up living in english and i really wanted to try life in french, which takes us to the most important point: french.
if you don't speak it and/or are not willing to learn it, i don't think quebec city is a viable option. yes, most people (under a certain age) will be able to speak it, but that's not the language people use in day to day life. that's not the language you'll hear when out and about. in montreal, it is a lot easier to live in english only.
i chose to live here \_because\_ i wanted to learn and speak french.
it is always the question anyone asks me, given that il lived 3 years in each city now. the two cities are completely different with different vibes, and you seem to already know that.
you pointed out the differences. i'll add to what you said:
- qc is more nature focus while mtl is more culture focus.
- qc without a car is difficult, mtl is easy
- qc is way closer to a lot of nice hikes, waterfalls, etc.
- mtl is doable without speaking french, qc will be really hard. basic french would be needed.
-october is the start of snowfall in qc while you probably wont see snowflakes in mtl (which is almost always 5°c hotter)
what should i recommend you ? all depends on you and what you are searching. with what you said, i'd think you'll be more in touch with the mtl vibes, but again, qc is better for vacations when you want to discover, and are able to take a car.
pm me if you chose qc and want to know some cool places to see.
québec city is the full cultural experience. montréal if you like large cities that feel different from each other. québec city has more nature and sightseeing, montréal has more urban stuff, nightlife, etc.
in montréal practically everyone speaks english enough to communicate. 
in quebec city you cannot expect everyone to speak english. you might have to ask a few people if they speak english. over 40 year old, the vast majority has terrible english.
[deleted]
i guess it would kind of be like deciding between chicago and milwaukee. chicago has a population of 2.7 m people while montreal is just just under 2 m people, while milwaukee is just under 600 k people and quebec city is over 500k people. it’s just that quebec is more quaint and half of it is on top of large hill while the other half is on the river bank. both cities have lots of cultural events and coffee shops. montreal is not as quaint, but has way more to it. if you don’t speak french it would be easier to be in montreal. then again - the two cities are only 2.5 hours apart - you can easily visit both. quebec is hilly - montreal is comparatively flat - maybe you love being able to get views or perhaps you prefer not having to climb a lot - keep that in mind too. montreal has more museums. quebec has a good share for its size because it is a historical and provincial capital.
quebec city is overall much cleaner and more historical and beautiful in a way. 
montreal is more of a city vibe more vibrant but also less clean overall.
definetly in montreal you'll have an easier time when it comes to language, you can totally live off english there.
i recommend you visit both cities to catch the vibe, during the summer if possible before you decide. good luck.
nature is closer in québec city
regarding dogs: there's a growing list of bars and shops accepting dogs inside or  at least on the terraces in quebec city, if that's a plus for you. also as others mentioned, there's more proximity to nature, thus potentially more activities you can enjoy with your fur babies.
regarding french in quebec city: you can still live in quebec city with only a minor grasp of the language, since tourism is a large part of the city's economy, but the locals will definitely warm up to you if you bother to learn their language. occasionally well placed "tabarnak" or "caliss" (common french canadian swear words) and becoming a poutine connoisseur are usually seen very positively by locals :')
thanks for the advice. and the swear words! :)
thank you for taking the time to reply to me.
thank you for taking the time to reply to me
thank you for taking the time to reply to me
thank you!!!
my thoughts exactly. having lived in montréal for 17 years and spending quite a bit of time in qc, i recommend doing both as you have the time and both are entirely different experiences.
thank you!!!!!
thank you so much
thx
companies from the south shore.
the costs for the public, the profits for the private sector.
the majority of infrastructure projects are massively supported by companies.
there is practically nothing that stimulates the economy more in addition to facilitating the transport of citizens, that is, of their employees.
whether it's the tram or the 3rd link, it's hard to find an infrastructure project that will not be supported by the majority of companies, even if they are not unanimous among the population.
companies from the south shore 🤢
the québec-lévis tunnel will have a positive effect on travel times by reducing the pressure on the pierre-laporte and québec bridges, which have reached their maximum capacity during rush hour since 2011
principally. it is clear that companies will be for it.
there is only that in this article. it's not worth much. it is certain that businesses in lévis will say that they need it ...
a bridge or a tunnel connects two shores. wasn't that tempting them to probe the other too?
no, increasing the number of roads does not decrease traffic, it has been understood for a very long time in town planning as a principle! in addition, traffic has hardly increased in the last 20 years. finally, the light traffic of 15 minutes at the head of the bridges does not justify the 10 billion for 20-50 thousand users per day!
it comes from the article you would know if you had read it ...
whether it comes from the article or not, it remains false
i too am able to write about a world of unicorns in newspapers. that won't make unicorns exist though.
projection ?
i work in a day camp around laval university and we are still looking for an instructor for both the regular english camps. you can write to me in private if you're interested for more information.
parks canada hires students in the summer to be guide-interpreters on the city's historic sites.
i ask myself the same question! submit if ever!
do you expect day camps to be open this summer?
nice is pretty much my kind of stuff. we have the same job here but we have to go canoeing on the ottawa river. the only place i applied for is the musée de la civilization, as a front desk attendant and cashier / advisor in the shop. the museum reminds me a lot of our old museum of civilizations, now renamed the museum of history.
they were last summer, i worked there and i have a friend from quebec who also worked in a camp. if we trust the fact that the virus follows a certain seasonal curve and that we vaccinate more and more people, i would not see why they would not be open. otherwise the parents would be in trouble because the children will not go to school during the summer. now what is the difference between a day camp and a daycare?
they were last year with fairly strict measures. it's like school, the city wants to keep its day camps open!
i wondered why a fun fact like this was worth an entire article, then i read.
nice!
when you want things to get done, you have to act! good job!
the city will undoubtedly ban him so that he does not hurt himself ...
similar subject: there is also a graffiti painting in homage to floyd at dollard des ormeaux park downtown. if you were ever looking for an excuse to take a walk ...
it would be interesting to see the differences between the regions of quebec.
i wonder if the police are really doing anything about these reports. unless we're talking about a big gathering of several dozen people, i seriously doubt it.
if my neighbor denounces me i shit on his steps every night for the next coliss year.
and between the sectors of the city. it says beauport, boulevard ste-anne ... we are not surprised
you have to have a regular saddle to get there every night.

it is all the same bastard of marchand. gosselin, no trouble. it's harder to collaborate with lefts, it looks like. that says a lot
she didn't compromise, she avoided an obvious trap. marchand offers him a seat in exchange for his silence for 4 years. obviously the answer was going to be no.
gosselin can easily accept the deal offered to jackie. he is no longer a leader, he no longer has to say anything on behalf of his party.
and all the messages he wants to send can go through the chef.
but jackie is the leader so she must speak on behalf of the party and she has no other elected officials of her party through whom to pass the messages.
his strategy is to use his increased media visibility for 4 years to promote his ideas and his party so that both score more next time. she just can't say yes to being muzzled.
i'm pretty sure that there are several politicians who would have accepted marchand's deal, and i think it is to his credit.
what a story! they announced savard so early. i did not vote for her, but i have a little pity: it is still humiliating to give a victory speech only to realize that you have lost…
[the count is over, here is the portrait for the quebec city council: - 10 advisers for team marie-josée savard - 6 advisers for quebec strong and proud - 4 advisers for quebec 21 - 1 advisor for transition quebec] ( // twitter.com/iciquebec/status/1457576000708091904)
quite a last minute turnaround, and honestly a very unexpected result for me
seeing it live was epic. i refreshed every two seconds
i slept very well thinking about that
did patrice moi apologize to the audience?
hi my friend,
you can probably get a warehouse or backoffice job with just spoken english. these jobs can even be somewhat well paid.
but its very important that you learn french. you would feel frustrated and isolated otherwise. ive seen it happen among immigrants who dont speak and dont learn the language.
moreso, speaking french will give you access to very good jobs, unionized sometimes, with pension, etc. thats what my so did.
my advise tho is to not assume right away that people speak english. "hello. i speak poor french, do you speak english?"
some simple french greetings will go a long way to make people love you. "hello, thank you, good evening, goodbye, etc"
people here love to see a foreigner learn our language. locals are charmed to see people try.
welcome!
you can probably find a job without french if it’s not customer service of something you have to talk a lot. most people speak english enough to accomodate you. but you definitely have to learn french if you want a social life, decent job, etc
welcome
honestly, one of the easiest hospitality job to get into right now if you don’t speak french would be in houskeeping. i know pretty much every hotel in the city is short staffed. depending on the property, lots of places are offering decent salaries to help recruit workers and it’s easy to move up the ladder once you’re in, even in a different department. good luck with your search!
edited to add: i work in a hotel where pretty much 90% of housekeeping staff didnt initially have a very strong french when they were first employed
did the same move a couple of months ago, no regrets. feel free to pm me with any questions. je te souhaite bonne chance pour ton déménagement!
hello and welcome!
there is a lot of demand in some sectors that wont require you to speak french, like in restaurants or delivery and such, but you'll definitely need some human contact to learn french! pm me when you're in town if you need help or want to grab a drink and practice!
[deleted]
a lot of people are suggesting jobs that won't give you a lot of human contact, this won't help in improving your french. 
you mentioned bartending, which could work. i had a friend that knew very little french work in the old city as a server at a breakfast joint. most drinks and booze have the same name no matter if it's french or english, so you could probably work a bar without too much trouble (in the old city). especially if you have past experience, i know mixology and drinks are a big part of toronto's social life. if not bartending, you can bus and work your way into a position you want. could also be a sandwich/snack shop, late-night street food spot on st jean or the old city.
definitely don't go into a hidden job expecting your french to improve, you gotta mingle and experience the city. coming to qc to switch things up for a year or more would be wasted by working in a warehouse or backoffice.
hey op, what's your éducation or skills? the place i work at, is currently hiring and french isn't needed, but would be nice to have.
i work at costco (ste-foy) and they are desperately looking for people. i’d imagine you’d have a pretty good shot.
i visited so many times. everybody was nice and we spoke in english. a lot of turists there....beautiful city.
i worked with a guy from victoria who at some time made a point of not speaking french. and i totally was an enabler you will face some people who will not accept that you don’t speak french after awhile. if you’ve never been here you will be surprised at how welcoming people are.
many people are working remotely now. have you considered a remote job?
i'm moving to qc from toronto too! will be there in mid-november or early december. my partner is from france and i'm hoping to improve my french while i'm there too. would be great to exchange dms/meet up to find out about your experience!
people doesn’t respect you for your religion, but the rest is ok, as a guy from quebec
awesome advice. thank you so much. i am hard worker and i don’t mind doing whatever it takes until i learn your beautiful language :). seems the possibilities are endless already. i am very excited.
thanks a bunch :). i am very eager to learn french :). appreciate your comment.
thank you for your comment. i worked in hotel management while completing my masters in computer science. i do know the business well. but don’t think i want to go back to housekeeping but it’s a respectable job. i was hoping to bartend for a bit …i don’t need to start working right away either.
thank you. i love reddittors :) i will update once i arrive safe and sound.
hello there main guy :) i will definitely pm you with my buddy together. the more the merrier. i am leaving toronto on tuesday the 19th and will probably message you on the 21st sir. very kind offer and i will take you up on it :). love  🇨🇦
just got tired of bug/big city life. made enough money to chill and learn new language …i just want a little bit of income to socialize etc …. i am a tech guy ….
welcome to qc. it’s been good so far. you can dm me for sure.
i am religionless ;)
i found this government page about the french classes they can offer to immigrants.
my so is an international immigrant and was paid! to follow these french classes
maybe an intra canadian immigrant can avail of something like that.
good luck
i would advise you start by trying french here! i hope this doesn't come off as rude, but if you're serious about wanting to learn the language this is an easy way to get started.
best of luck in your journey
> thanks a bunch :). i am very eager to learn french :).
then start *now*. if you can’t find the will to start in toronto, you won’t in quebec. immersion doesn’t make it one bit easier, just faster by making you struggle more often.
besides, the headstart will pay off when you move.
you have a master in computer science? programming skills? there's plenty of programmer / software engineering positions jobs in quebec city. and huge demand for qualified workers. i know some employers won't mind the language barrier either - some even offer french courses!
> i am a tech guy
tech guy as in got training/degree in it/software/compute science?
if so, finding a job here won't be too hard. i know a software development place that offer french/english classes to employees.
pm me of you're interested.
[deleted]
what do you do in the tech universe? we have plenty of jobs in it in quebec city and knowing only english (to start) will not be a problem. unless you want to retire from this life, i can get it hah.
well, welcome to quebec
brilliant. this is incredible brother!! definitely taking up on the government’s assistance. cheers mate.
already on it. learnt the alphabets and the numerical system. i paid for an app lol
hi , i just needed a little break from programming. i am a little fade up currently tbh ….
besides i am going to use the government assistance to learn the language first , then decide what i want to do. knowing both languages is gold ;)
nor finding a job elsewhere. i live in quebec but i work remotely.
hence i decided to move :). also i haven’t seen my best friend in 6 years so that’s that :).
i need a break for this life yes. not retiring but i would love to work on myself and work for myself eventually.
thank you brother :).
i'm afraid it doesn't work for canadian citizens mate. iirc.
maybe a remote job around software engineering but not directly related to programming?
qa, documentation, customer support.. there's a few options. your technical skills will serve you well.
so sorry, i don't understand the extent of what a tech guy does (because there is a very active video game industry in quebec city, and i imagine that is not it), but some place you could check as a tech guy is the english school board and champlain college. maybe they are hiring. that would be the worst for learning the language though ;)
there is also an active (and friendly) english-speaking community, and i found out that they have a job bank: [
awww lol that’s ok. thanks for the info :)
it does even if it didn’t use to, it was implemented under the current government.
find a place that has a good bartender who you get along with.
a good bartender is someone who can start a conversation between his customers and keep it healthy. this way you get to know other people without necessarily getting too involved.
personally, i always go out alone, i don't like to wait too long for people in life. usually i go to a small bar where i'm used to and where i know the staff well. sometimes i have cool conversations with random people but usually i go there for a drink, to unwind (or to dance when we could in an old life!) and i go home. i imagine that i am too boring too but hey, i happen to chat with nice people who don't necessarily believe me and that passes the time!
social anxiety? personally, i went alone a few times to a bar in a city where i didn't know anyone and in the end i had a few drinks without talking to anyone.

maelstrom

night boat
i would also suggest st-angèle if you like jazz music.
it's very small and i often see people sitting alone at the bar and chatting with the bartender. there are also often tourists who go there alone since it is in old quebec. that's a lot of people to talk to.
upvote just because i like your username. lol
oh yes? i would say it depends a lot on why you are experiencing this stress. i'm not a shrink, but i have social anxiety and i can relate to what you say. there is a large community on reddit (r / socialanxiety) where several people share their struggles or experiences with their social anxiety. i advise you to go for a walk and read a little to see if you ever recognize yourself in it. if so, it might help you understand yourself better.
edit: oh wait, i see you're already on this sub.
i second for the night boat, i spent several evenings there alone chatting with seb (the barman) and it was really nice. you leave with a bonus if you like rock / metal
i second the boat at night, go for a ride when it reopens.
maelstrom is still open? make an osti that i'm not going. might be
the bar is closed, seb has covid and no one else is employed.
seb is really a chef
oh i'm coming to see this, it's really boring :(
i hope he will recover quickly and come back to good health
lower salary, higher taxes, french, cold winter
the city being french makes immigrants all go to montréal so they can pick up english instead.
we speak french?
don't tell too many people 😉
even though our prices would be lower than elsewhere, they are rising for us too. read about québec's history and try to learn some french... maybe you'll get "the catch".
daycare: they have very limited subsidized spots. both my kids entered schools before we could get a spot. they have a tax credit for private daycares but it ends up being significantly more expensive.
we also pay more income tax than in ontario. 
but overall yeah it’s a nice place.
most people (teachers, nurses, etc.) make less than in ontario. french also puts a soft cap on immigration, which makes our city feel self-contained but keeps prices relatively low. quality of life is pretty good though :)
other than our cold winters there's no catch really... as others said, salaries are much lower and taxes higher, so what you perceive as cheap housing is not the obvious here. it's becoming to be real hard for people to buy a first house.
having travelled in multiple places for work, i have to say i did not see a lot of cities that offer as much quality of life than quebec city. that's why i'm still based here and still love it so much.
french is probably the number one reason, and weather second. the province is almost a city-state with montreal at its center, with ottawa and toronto nearby. there's a soft line where the montreal suburbs end and you enter purely french speaking, poorer, less cosmopolitan québec (the province). the capital of *that* is québec city, with little but growing immigration, its surprisingly harsher winters; much more snow than montreal, winter lasts almost an extra month. obviously québec is off the toronto-vancouver-montreal list of what constitutes canada to most people. this all means there's not that many dollars chasing homes here. 
i grew up here and lived in montreal for a while. great place. but as i was getting older and my spouse and i were looking to start a family, it just made sense to move back closer to friends and family in our little francophone bubble. we bought a freehold townhouse a hair over 400k, that would easily cost 800-1m in montreal anywhere reasonable on the island. and yeah, often it feels like we're in a forgotten corner of the world. people in other canadian subs never mention québec city when discussing home ownership and places to live, cause we're not on anyone's mind. but we truly have it all! this place is a paradise to have a family.
french winters and salaries are lower
prices are going up here too, but not as fast.
it's basically a bubble, easy for people to grow up here but hard for people to come in. for instance, hubby was from bc but they made it super difficult for the schooling to transfer, he had to restart. and alot of the people here don't know anything when you ask for help. also it's not very diverse if you're in qc, alot of the food is catered towards being more sweet.
if you earn more than 40 000 $ / year you are in the bourgeoisie.
cheap salaries... cheap houses
toronto gta is 6.5 million habitants, quebec city is 0.8
people can still live in surrounding cities and drive to qc downtown < 30 mins, easily. that simply isn't possible in toronto.
i personally don't think french has anything to do with housing prices.
especially the last 2 things
and it's perfect like that.
are french winter colder than english winter ?
oops, virgule
he looks like a real champion.
i don't like to judge by appearances, but ...
at first glance, you did your research / homework. it doesn't sound too complicated to use and i get the message!
you might have a chance with "spotted" type facebook pages for this area, if there are any ...
i hope you burned a lantern in the basilica, it's not saint-antoine but still !!! best of luck !!!
good luck!

we have sold twice with duproprio, it was relatively simple which made us realize that the agents are overpaid for the little work.
it took us 5 hours of "work" (papers, visits, etc.) to sell our house. an agent would charge at least 15k, that makes him $ 3000 an hour.
nobody looking for a house is limited to what their agent shows them, tlm is looking on property anyway, so their "network of contacts" is an argument that they use to poke you, but will not be worth much. what we have seen from people around us who have sold with remax or whatever.
salespeople put a lot of pressure on the whole transaction, they don't want people to stop and think about their business (otherwise they lose their commission)
especially with the current market, where agents say to bet 50% above value, not to inspect and to make no conditions, it is quite sure that their goal is to maximize their own profit and not to help us buy / sell a house at our budget / taste.
also: if you find yourself someone to buy your house, you will have to pay the commission to your agent even if he has done nothing!
duproprio all the way.
i wanted to use duproprio, i called them and their incessant upselling made me rather go see a broker, they are exhausting. basically their model is to always make you buy additional services.
the broker took care of everything, phones, visits, negotiations, papers ... we rented a cottage for a weekend and let the broker work. sold in 48 hours and we also got $ 30,000 more than we wanted on the house. i consider it to be thanks to the marketing techniques and the experience of the broker. it paid the commission and more ... the market is crazy, but an experienced broker still brings value.
we sold with a broker while my neighboring condo sold with du proprio.
to be done again, owner all the way ... yes we had nothing to do, but my neighbor received more visitors and sold faster. at worst, if you can't sell, call an agent afterwards
there is no right or wrong answer. personally, i don't have 5 hours minimum to give in paperwork, i have too uncertain schedules to manage visits, and i even less want to meet potential buyers.
so for me, even though the broker charges very expensive, i consider it worth it. "buy peace", as they say. fortunately, a good friend of mine is a broker, and i don't really mind contributing to his economic development.
i'm about to go with proprio, but to offer a small percentage that would correspond to a share that an agent who brings a client would have touched anyway ...
by offering for example 2% ttc, you save almost 2/3 of the usual commission (5.75%) and the agents still bring people ...
i sold my house in sherbrooke in 2018 with duproprio. it took me 7 months with many free visits. even under these conditions, i find it worth it.
today with the market on fire? i wouldn't hesitate to do it again.
we also bought our house this fall with duproprio and it went like clockwork.
it is certain that brokers have access to a pool of buyers that duproprio does not have (change of employment within the government) but in the current market it is an argument which has less influence.
how much is a broker's commission? let's say 5%, that means that out of 225,000, it costs $ 11,250.
let's say 2% is $ 4,500.
the paperwork can seem complicated but the owner can accompany you if you have any questions.
only advantage i can see is if the broker managed to sell your house for more than you would have sold it yourself. and it must be minimum an increase that pays all its commission.
last march we sold our condo in 2 days with duproprio. our buyer used the services of a broker ... it was advantageous for us (regarding the paperwork);)
late for a response from the owner's maize completely.
there was a time (before 2000) that brokers had a monopoly on mls - listings, photos, contacts, buyers. to find or sell you had to find an active agent in the specific neighborhood. they were worth their weight in gold to find that gem, and they were working for real to find a buyer / seller and make a sale.
today you can do everything yourself. no need for an agent to find it, everything is online. even virtual tours with 3d model. so what's going on? buyers may get a few options from the agent, but basically buyers do all the legwork themselves anyway, and they call an “agent” to book an appointment and a viewing. let's say it's a terrible price for 2-3 phone calls and a couple of visits.
you should also remember that the image that the agent is there to increase your value is a huge lie. the agent is there to make a sale. as many sales as possible, as quickly as possible.
“but agents have an interest in selling more for a better commission and therefore there is an incentive to work harder !!” you tell me. well no. it's wrong. look, does an agent want to make a sale for $ 300,000 quickly, or $ 350,000 in 6 months and lots of visits and account management?
300000 x 2% = 6000$
350000 x 2% = 7000$
in one case he can sell 20 houses a year because he sells quickly.
in the other case, he risks not selling (too expensive), the mandate expires after a lot of work (too long) and the seller risks not renewing the mandate (“bad” agent).
so what is the dynamic?
often the buyer will take the agent who promises the highest sale. the agent has the warrant. he knows it's too expensive for the market so he doesn't put any effort into it, but he'll of course be visiting if there are any interested.
after some time, the seller said to his agent: “why not sold? you promised! ”
“ah yes, but you know i don't control buyers, and the market is always fluctuating .... maybe the price should be lowered”.
then the price is eventually lowered to a reasonable price. but at this point potential buyers are more hesitant. “why has the house been on the market for 6 months? did other buyers see anything wrong with the house? ”
so buyers become more suspicious, are less in a hurry, and negotiate harder.
during this time the agent still does nothing but he has a 6-7 month term contract and a guaranteed commission if he sells, but for no effort it is not all worse!
in today's hot market, another strategy is to convince the buyer of a price a little lower than the trend by promising higher bids. the seller is then very excited!
so there is a lot of interest, a lot of visits, and maybe offers for the asking price (we hope) or more (bonus).
if that happens so much the better the seller is forced to sell because the asking price is reached and the agent has his guaranteed commission.
all this again for almost zero effort.
then. are you asking me if a real estate agent is worth it?
unless you have a very special case, like a bed and breakfast, or a house with serious flaws, or something like that that involves some legal or commercial stuff, no. triple no. a hundred times no.
all the advertising you will see brokers tends to say that it is seriously complicated and full of dangers. it's wrong. and if ever there was a glitch like this, the agent won't help, zero. it'll be you with the lawyers anyway.
a real estate agent today? hahahahahahaha.
from the owner all the way. they have a hotline to help you in all circumstances.
i moved to quebec from winnipeg a few years ago. first impresssions were that everyone keeps to themselves. people are nice but they won't generally talk to you for no reason.  with the lovely exeption of old women who often said hi and struck up short conversations especially in my old neighbourhood (st-sauveur) or at the supermarket.  also i've really enjoyed feeling completely safe walking around at night. sketchiest thing that every happened was some guy tried to sell me a radio at like 10 pm on a street corner lol. that was more funny than anything else. there also seems to be a suprising number of private schools for the size of the city or maybe they were all just concentrated near me. if you are going to talk about school make sure you look up the quebecois system because it is unique (cégep). i can't speak to the experience in the school system though since i didn't grow up here.  quebec city also has a pretty low enemployment rate and lots of stable gouverment jobs. the core and older areas of the city are really walkable and scaled for humans rather than cars. the same can not be said for the newer suburbs which feel like any other north american suburb and can sometimes be really innecessable if you don't have a car.
are there any dangerous neighborhoods?  i don’t think so.
>i'm writing a book in which the main character moves to quebec city
where from? the impression you get would be quite different depending on that! 
rich neighbourhoods = sillery (closer to the city centre), cap-rouge (further out).
there aren't any dangerous neighbourhoods. st-roch is probably the 'roughest' but it's still very safe.
transportation system = bus. it's okay.
grande allée is for bigger bars and clubs. st-jean is for smaller pubs (except la ninkasi). cocktails on grande allée, craft beer on st-jean.
quebec city is less like montreal regarding language so more people speak only french but still a lot of people are bilingual, especially the younger people. 
then there is the central neighborhoods. st-jean-batiste, montcalm, coline parlementaire are  *la* *haute ville (uptown)*. then there is st-roch, st-sauveur, and limoilou which are *la basse ville* (downtown). so you might guess that the basse ville is historically poorer than the haute ville but it's slowly getting gentrified. you might find interresting information [here]( and [here](
transportation wise the bus system is really nice and cover most of the city. you might find more info [here](
there is a lot to talk about so if you have a specific question, please ask.
i was a cameraman and did a contract where i followed a lady from the tourism office of the city. they wanted to know what people didn't like about the city. 2 things i remember were that there was no public bathrooms so you had to get into a shop and ask (they added some since). the other thing was that residents and store clerks in the old historic town were too quick to switch to english, we spoke to a french teacher with a group of high-school students from the us and they had a hard time practising french because as soon as they spoke with an english accent people were switching to english.
right now i'm working in the video games industry and there are a lot of anglo immigrants coming in to work as well. from my perspective they seem to adapt quickly and hang out with the anlgo community. french is hard to learn for anglophones and like i said, most people who speak english prefer to switch to it so its faster.
other than that, what people often think as "quebec city" is the chateau frontenac and surrounding area. but that is only the tourist-y part, the city is very wide and there are lots of different suburbs that were towns before and they were all (but one) absorbed into the city at one point. they all have a slightly different vibe to them.
the roughest part i would say is saint-roch, there are more homeless people and prostitution there. but even there the city feels very secure, there is not a lot of violent crime. i'm talking like only 1 murder every 2-3 years. the richest part i would say it sillery. there are some "islands" of rich development elsewhere but sillery is pretty much all fancy.
another thing is: lots of churches. catholic churches are more ornate and fancy looking and we have a lot of them.
the transportation system is evolving but its always hard for the suburbs because they are vast and far from the city. i grew up in a suburb to the north and took public transit to go to school for a few years and it took me 90min twice a day when i couldn't catch the express. in the dense part of town its pretty good and getting better, they just this year invested in a huge tramway project. it was hard to reach consensus because some people would prefer the money goes to a better road network ie. more wider highways.
schools are a mix of public and private but mostly public, we have an intermediate between high-school and university called cegep which is unique to the province of quebec. there is one big university campus in quebec city, université laval. the football team there is one of the best if not the best (most years) and it has been for many years. it does not compare to the us at all. the stadium is one of the biggest in the province and its a little more than 12k places.
quick fact: quebec city is at the top of the charts for ratio of above-ground swimming pools per household. check the suburbs on google maps everyone has a pool. the summer are not very long but they get quite hot!
i used to live in outaouais, which is close to the ontario/québec border. i moved to québec about 6-7 years ago to go to cegep. it's a 4h drive from outaouais. the very first thing i noticed was that they don't prononce certain french words the same way, like "baleine", "arrête" and "poto". they also have this weird local quirk where they say la bus instead of le bus (in french the word bus is masculine). i also found out that québec is known to host a very very shitty radio channel, called radio x. some of the hosts of that radio are huge sceptics about things like climate change, systemic racism, sexism, and they also undermine the pandemic. they are a lot of other little quirksnin the vieux québec, which is the most active part of the city, mainly due to tourism but it's also a very nice spot to chill, shop in little local shops and eat good local food. the plaines d'abraham are also really popular! i go there at least once or twice a week for a quiet little picnic with a viee of the fleuve st-laurent. in certain parts of the vieux québec, it almost feels like walking in some european city, it's really beautiful and has a really unique vibe. other than that, it's not a very complicated city. to me it felt like a really huge village with city advantages.
i've mooved from a small rural town to quebec city about 8 years ago, i'm a french canadian so there wasn't much of a culture shock to me but one of the most fascinating thing about the town for me is it's architecture the old meets the new and there are two types of architecture in the historic neighborhood , the english one and the french one.
i wouldn't say there are violent neighborhood, although i'm a white straight dude, so that might be different for other people. quebec is sometimes referred to as "gros village" which translates (mostly) to a big small-town.
depends where your character is moving from before coming to quebec city. small village people consider quebec city as a "big city" and people from montreal or toronto think it's like a "small city". personally i moved from montreal to quebec city back in 2009 because i met a girl from lac saint-jean during a trip overseas...and the first weeks were boring as fuck...i didn't know anybody besides my girlfriend and i had nowhere to go for fun or at least i didn't know the good spots...unlike montreal it's pretty easy to go somewhere and catch a vibe. but now i still live here in quebec city...sadly i'm not with the girl anymore; the relationship did not last through my university years at laval for obvious reasons haha 😄! my life could actually be a good storyline for your book!
a refugee is likely to end up in either of those neighborhoods : maizerets, vanier or some parts of ste-foy (i don't know the neighborhood names there as well). i've volunteered for the [centre multiethnic de quebec]( the non-profit who is responsible for helping immigrants of all kinds settle and *thrive* in the city. i've personally been in contact with syrians and bengladeshi, but i know there are some from the african and south american continent. the [*conseil panafricain de québec*]( is the association of people from africa living in quebec city. they too might have a better idea of what your character might live.
i linked the *contact us* pages of both organizations in the paragraph above, since their websites are in french. were i you, i would contact them to get a much more realistic idea of what your character might go through.
edit: i don't know how useful it can be to you, but a quebec director i adore has made a movie about a situation similar to the one of your book : a bunch or south sudan refugees being relocated to america to start a new life. he used real sudanese refugees as his 4 main actors. the movie is taking place in the us, but watching it can give you an idea of the feelings of your character. [the good lie](
this made me think of boukar diouf, a guy from senegal who moved to rimouski(similar story) i think. you should read his bio on the matter. he is a comedian and makes a lot of sketch about that matter(in french). for me, mostly when i moved to quebec city it was the european feel of old quebec even though i've never been to europe. loved the fact that the city is near water and that you can see container ship going by. also, all of those little restaurants here and there gave it a chill vibe. hope it helps.
first impression: very beautiful city, one of the most beautiful ones in canada i would say. very safe and clean. hardly any sketchy people. after staying there for 3 years, i found the general public to be quite rude and narrow minded at times. for example, if you are running to catch the bus, the bus driver may see you and still close the door just before you get there and drive off. just weird. it is also quite hard to make friends if you are not from there. feels like a small town but has everything a huge city would. the city it’s pretty much 99% french, so you will not get far if you do not learn the language as well
saint roch is full on grentrified even the hipster donc like it anymore , but the night life is moving there from grande allée/ saint jean .ex:  le dagobert is usually full of young people from out of town
nope, there are definitely some small pockets of sketchiness in st roch though.
i'd say vanier or saint-sauver are way "rougher" or at least poorer than st-roch , i've worked a couple years in st-roch and i never understood how people called it rough
if some characters speak french, in quebec city we say "la bus". a montrealer would say "le" bus.
>there aren't any dangerous neighbourhoods. st-roch is probably the 'roughest' but it's still very safe.
i'd like to emphasize that part : quebec city has been evaluated as one of the top 3 cities in the world for personal safety, and the first in all of the americas.
thank you for your reply! the main character is a refugee from somalia, sorry i probably should've mentioned that.
about the radio comment : sooo being a skeptic and asking questions is "shitty".. ok, that's exactly what i thought about you guys
thank you for your reply! the main character is a refugee from somalia, sorry i probably should've mentioned that.
for real! i worked in saint-roch for years and while it’s gotten better (especially saint-joseph with it’a microbreweries and restaurants and shops), there’s a lot of homelessness in the area, and while i (30-ishf) wasn’t really afraid to walk alone even after dark, i’d walk a bit faster than in other areas, let’s just say that.
it's because it *was* back in the 1990's. now it's gentrified, and the poor people moved to vanier and st-sauveur. st-rock is way more bourgeois now than it once was. back in the 1990's, there was a *shopping mall* that was just a roof built on top of the st-joseph street. it was known as the place people without a home went to *live*. it was truly horrible.
i guess that's true. i think it's just the reputation it had back in the day and it's much better now that it's been revitalised (in the 90s i think?).
the occasional street prostitute near the church probably doesn't help.
have you been down there since the homeless shelter moved near by?  went for a walk down st joseph during the brief time restaurants were reopened in march.  the people in the cute little restaurants were offset by the woman being arrested in front of the church.  i don't feel unsafe walking in a couple or anything, but yeah, it's a bit rough.
the bus = dealing between points of importance. the bus = what brings you from place lo to the metallica show, easy.
there's plenty of reasons why those shows are shitty
they're complete shit because their hosts keep sharing misinformation about all those sensitive subjects, which is ultimately dangerous given the state of the world right now. their followers are selfish antivaxx, pro-plague idiots that spend their days harrassing people with their shit opinions about poc, immigrants, women and native people, and so are the hosts. if you think that's a good thing then i really don't give a flying fuck about your opinion.
yeah, but we're 20 years past so if op wants some fresh news on the city we might be better not to feed him 90s stereotypes
late 90s early 2k
what do you mean the shelter moved near by? afaik the auberivières has been close for years. i personally have only seen police pick up someone only once while i was in the neighborhood at 2-3 a.m.
quite convinced that there are more people than you think taking la bus in quebec 😂
i do not understand.
edit: i had not read the last line of your comment. i was missing the end of the videotron center. (so i missed the joke.)
what i know for a fact is that you 100% never listened to the station and just enjoy shitting on any no left-wing source of information because they don't confirm your preconceived notions.
none of the host are anti-vax btw, they all encourage vaccination.
well, it *wasn't* a stereotype back then, and maybe ~~op~~ *the redditor you replied to* didn't live near in the last 15-20 years so he (she?) simply doesn't know better.
edit: i meant the top commenter, not op.
yeah now that everyone knows they're shit they're turning their speech around, how convenient since they started loosing their funding due to the crap they keep saying. also i did listen to it once or twice, they try to pass their opinions as facts and the hosts are all around idiotic boomers. i really don't feel like arguing in my second language, especially to some internet rando that feels like defending such a shit radio station. beubye now
yeah said that wrong, i should have said a stereotype based on the 90's and the creator of the post doesn't know about québec so he never implied st-roch was rough or that it wasn't.
i was thinking the same by the way, beubye
i read your comment wrong. i meant the top commenter, who maybe didn't live in st-rock in the last decade or so.
it would have been fun if the lower town was better served, but so much the better if the project progresses.
we'll have a little subway.
logically, it's behavior that counts, not race. it should be everywhere like this
it's equality
the worst are the chihuahuas!
ironically, i believe that small dogs are responsible for more attacks than large ones. we just talk less about it because it is not fatal to be attacked by a poodle or chihuahua versus a doberman or pitbull.
you can't run faster than a big dog.
a little dog won't really be able to stop you from running away.
i love the transparency and the attitude of the gentleman. it's worth listening to this.

in a context or supposedly, you lack employees, it's pretty cave to act like this towards those you have.
i walked past yesterday. seriously, if i was a customer and knew how management treated their employees, i wouldn't want to stay at the hilton.
their demands are quite reasonable. 1.5 to 2.5% increase is far below the norm.
where are you from buddy?
immerse yourself in the city and its activities! 
october to january can be a fun period, you'll get the first snow and christmas vibes.
[ can be a good source of inspiration. 
you can also post here in french! it can be good practice.
voice of english-speaking québec hosts events where you can meet other anglophones living in the city. it's a great way to meet new people if your french isn't perfect.
heyo! i'm an ontarian that's been living in quebec city for close to a decade. what sort of things do you enjoy? music, sports, etc.?
there's a group of people who meet up to practice speaking their second (or third or fourth) language regularly. it had to stop because of the pandemic but it slowly starts back. [here's the event for this week]( but on the group, you can get notified for the next ones.
thank you so much!
i enjoy music, movies, travelling and dancing as well (i.e. bachata, free style etc.) . sorry for my late response i just arrived in quebec.
sorry for my late response. i just arrived in qubec city. i enjoy travelling, music, movies and also dancing (i.e. bachata, free style etc.)
merci beaucoup ! this is very helpful. thank you so much
it has surely already been discussed but "rental condos" is a fancy name for expensive apartments?
at last!! it wasn't nearly hard
more expensive rental condos 🙄🙄🙄
at least it's not done by management paradise. phew
yes exactly
i would have liked to see social housing but it's still better than a water hole 🤷🏻‍♂️
okay, one helps the problem, the other amplifies it!
they make you drive along boulevard hamel, drive in the residential area (children, cycle path) then in the industrial area. no motorway, no segment above 50km / h.
make your blind spots, me at one point during the journey she says to me: you know what blind spots are? i answer: yeah i would have to make one there eh? ... i spent anyway hahaha.
i lost a lot of points because i was not looking specifically both ways at each intersection (green light). i spent at least
i had a zone at 70 on hamel and i did not realize it. it was the examiner who pointed it out to me. for the rest it's not bad, plus a ton of school buses.
you have to pay attention to the part of the residential area. you will see a single 30km / h sign when entering the neighborhood. you have to keep this speed until you come out of the neighborhood and see the sign that turns you over at 50km / h. this part seems endless.
your exit number 14-15 brings you to exactly the same corner. the instructor usually takes you to the assessor's usual spots.
same for me
fuck radio x, but i don't know if we can really hold them accountable that someone defied the law like that. opinion radio says whatever it is. that doesn't mean we have to listen to them.
edit: a reading of the article is essential before commenting. lesson learned.
it takes an investigation. if what the anonymous group claims is true, there is indeed a great deal of responsibility for the radio. we can not know only on hearsay ...
just the fact that they rushed to remove the interviews from their site says it all.
on the web, nothing really disappears altogether ....
one can find deleted interviews in question:
[
what a fiasco
[deleted]
before i get pulled from rocks: i don't listen to choi radio x.
then, i find it all the same special which reproaches them:
> he was involved in a campaign to denigrate public health led by radio x and which lasted several months, from june 2020 to march 2021
as far as i know, we have the right to openly criticize any private or public body.
> on october 27, dominic maurais was heard suggesting that gym owners could contest a ticket if they opened illegally.
more than 6 months ago, a host ** suggested ** that we can contest a ticket ... i don't really see a problem!
> to the extent that the radio hosts invited the public to protest to their deputy against the health measures imposed.
i find that when it is very very good as a way of protesting. better than going to break stuff / windows in the streets.
> on march 4, 2021, dominic maurais is organizing a draw for 10 méga fitness gym memberships.
were the gyms open on this date? i don't know, but open or closed, to have a competition to encourage a local business, why not?
> they routinely invite not only several conspiratorial leaders, but also fallen doctors and other experts. they also circulate all kinds of dangerous theories (collective immunity, chloroquine, uselessness of health measures, etc.) ”, it is written in the letter.
i prefer to hear the point of view of someone who says anything than to hear only 1 side of the coin. in a normal society, it is by debating and exchanging ideas that we advance. no?
anyway, like i mentioned i don't listen to choi radio x so maybe they said other things and probably aren't snow white. on the other hand, what is mentioned in the article for me are behaviors far from reprehensible.
i don't think like them, but they have the right to think differently and to say it.
why blame the radio station and not the presenters concerned?
> fuck radio x, but i don't know if we can really hold them accountable that an individual defied the law like that.
the coroner is not a police force which finds culprits and takes them to court. their job is to investigate disasters such as we had there and to suggest improvements to the government to avoid such things in the future.
it is perfectly legitimate to have the coroner inquire into this. and if the government passes the laws suggested by the coroner (he is not required to) and radio x violates these new laws, then the consequences should follow.
and the only clips that have been removed from the episodes concerned are those with dan marino: everything else is still present.
source: i have done my research
they have been singled out for that too, with good reason!
they have [listed everything] ( you can judge for yourself.
the animators do the job, right?
i will definitely go search! thank you :)
however, for example, when a player of the montreal canadiens behaves inappropriately, we do not judge the entire club.
php quebec still seems active after all these years:
the [opencode] ( existed in quebec between 2011 and 2016 as a monthly meeting to discuss code.
funny coincidence, we decided to launch a public slack at the beginning of the week to relaunch this same community, but in an “online” version.
the link to join slack is in the post that explains our motivations:  (it's a public facebook post so even without a facebook account it should be searchable).
i work in consultation in quebec. my employer and my client have slack and both have groups for sth only. on the other hand, i have not seen a group outside of work.
> php quebec
okay but why ?
yes, it does. it's probably easier in montreal and you wouldn't have to learn (as much) french. quebec city is great but you might prefer to live & work in montreal while visiting quebec city. 
what aspects of a smaller city attract you?
i work in it in quebec city as a software dev. i know the space well. i work in consulting mostly for qc gouv. their is banking and insurance we large it need as well. ubisoft and some others video game companies have large ish dev need. you can pm me if you want to know more.
>	1.	does quebec city have jobs in tech/software industry?
yes, in some specific areas: banking, industrial automation, some gaming (a.k.a. ubisoft), and, of course, government consulting.
if you're looking for more "silicon valley-y" stuff (for lack of a better word; e.g. with kubernetes, serverless, and stuff like that), it is much more limited. so it depends.
and to be clear, this is not to say there isn't _anything_ like that. there are some startups here and there. but it's not a huge number, for sure. the focus here is more in things like government and banking, etc.
of course, you can always work remotely. i've been working remotely from quebec city for years. that has the benefits of a smaller town with considerable higher pay. remote isn't for everyone though. some people hate it.
>	2.	how difficult/easy is to find talent in quebec city, if you want to start a new software company?
if you're looking for, say, .net and java developers, it's ridiculously easy to find good ones. i believe javascript is also relatively easy to find.
if you're moving away from those, the pool starts getting smaller and you're going to face competition for talent. anecdotally, i know this french company that tried to settle here in quebec city but after 2 years they had to close the doors of their lab because they simply couldn't find enough go developers.
you've already had many answers for work, i would suggest starting to learn french asap. whether you choose montreal or quebec city, it's way easier if you already know sone french, even if it's not perfect. if french is your second language (if you currently speak english only), it'll be longer and harder than you think. it's not *that* bad, but many people underestimate the amount of effort and time it takes to properly learn a language, and the hardest language you will learn is your second one, that's when you have to separate words and syntax from concepts and meanings. when that is done once, every other language will be at least a little bit easier than the last.
but there are also plenty of ressources to learn, online like in person (outside of a pandemic, obviously), equally in toronto, montreal and quebec city.
i wish you success in this adventure!
there are great job in low to moderate side it start-ups/ factory tech support in québec and on the south side of the river (lévis). those are 2 separate town even if there is only a 1km whose river betweens those. and the is also some big company like the gouvernement, desjardins, industrial alliance, for name dropping only those, where there is always a little bit of staff change.
we have a lot to offer in it. if you wanna go the consulting route or work in large it, we have both. dm me if you want some contacts.
i work at a large software company that has officies in québec city.
they offer french classes for new hires if they need them. so far i touched a lot of programming languages from c++ to .net/c#, some mobile development, some typescript/web stuff, web api things and i'm getting into azure/cloud services kubernetes and [more buzz words here] lately.
i've been working for them since i graduated college (around 6 years now) and i'm very happy.
we don't hire as much as we used to due to covid but we have some job openings. pm me if you want a linkedin link.
a lot of people in my social circles are in it and have had absolutely no problems finding work in quebec city.
we're open for devs where i work. we mostly deal with insurance companies. we pay well and start with 6week of vacations.
better affordability to buy a place in quebec city as compared to montreal but i could be wrong. don’t want to live far from the city in order to afford a place. i am currently investigating salaries vs re. if you have more thoughts, please share. thanks 👍
that’s great to hear. i have seen ubisoft job postings on linkedin. do you also happen to know if it’s a good place to start a tech startup as well?
thank you for sharing this. it’s super helpful. on a different note, finding go developers is not easy in toronto also. 
it seems like you know the lay of the land. how do you see the growth of software industry in next 5 years in quebec city? are more private software companies opening up? in regards to startups, how’s the landscape of raising funds from investors?
buying a house in montreal is really expensive. like way too expensive. you could look for smaller towns around, like chambly or brossard but it's not cheap either. quebec would be more affordable. if you look for lévis, which is even cheaper like someone said, just be mindful of the traffic. lévis is practically 15 min from quebec city, but with the traffic it's more like 2 hours.
and there is lévis, on the south side of the river (5 to 15 min drive from québec downtown) where it is even cheaper.
it is! there's a cool community and lots of local talent. we could use more entrepreneurs though so if that's your cup of tea i think you'll be welcome with open arms.
i'm one of the organizer of  (on cool down during lock down) and i can say with confidence that there are a lot of passionate people in software engineering in the city.
don't hesitate if you have any question.
hi, i started a small video game company a couple years ago. i’d say that quebec city is quite vibrant and welcoming to tech startups. there’s a real community of passionate people here and we do help each other quite a lot. off course my experience is within the video game scene, so the tech startup scene may be different, but my impression is that it is quite similar. just different people. 
it is certainly less vibrant since the pandemic though, but we still communicate regularly on mailing lists and social networks. otherwise there would be regular in-person meet ups, events, competitions, etc. the city is small, so the word goes around fast when a new game studio pops up (be it a 1 person thing or bigger). and you’ll know everybody fast enough if you participate regularly. 
we also have le camp which is a great starting point. if i was in your situation, i would spend some time there within a heart bear. it’s more than a working space, you will gain access to training and learn about all the resources that are available to you as a startup owner. also a great place to meet like-minded people. again, not sure how it fares during covid though. 
quebec city has a lot of people into the visual arts, so if your startup needs that it’s a plus. they are talented, well educated, passionated and need a job. we got a lot of talented programmers as well, but as everywhere else they are hard to find. if you’re one of them, are competent and have experience, you can get a job basically anywhere.
like mentioned previously, everything’s in french by default here. you’ll be able to get around easily though, but expect that to be at least an annoyance. in comparison, montreal is bilingual by default.
usually, for fund raising, it’s pretty similar across quebec as investors will not really make a distinction between the 3 biggest cities in quebec (sherbrooke, quebec and montreal) as people tend to simply do business in all of them anyway as they’re quite close togheter (1-2.5h appart). but, we have a sector in quebec city called the technology park where you can find city subsidized offices to start you business. also, the provincial government is quite pro small business and there exist a lot of programs to help them out and subdivise salaries, give them tax breaks and help them out in other ways.
yea but traffic in the morning and evening
wow this is great. i looked at the conference website, and it gives me a good sense that a startup culture is already present in quebec city. thanks for sharing this. 
do you also happen if there are good incubators there? please share other pertinent resources as well if you have any.
thank you mightyddp for sharing knowledge from personal experiences. i will definitely research more about le camp. 
after hearing it from multiple folks on this thread, i am assured that there is definitely a lot of tech talent in quebec city.
didn’t know about the technology park, and the support provided by the government. this is super helpful, will look more into it. thanks 👍
i did it every morning before the covid situation, it's really not that bad. i find it's mostly something people from the north shore talk about 🤪
there's a few, though i don't know them very well.
i've heard mitigated feedback on le camp
idk i haven't done it myself. my friend used to do it last year every day for work and she hated it.
i suppose if op is from toronto, it would not be that bad !
definitely true. i live 11 kms away from my office in downtown toronto, and the street car used to take more than an hour 😅
my wife and i visited your beautiful city in 2009 for our honeymoon.  we had a wonderful time.  so much history!
i just recently discovered the subreddit /whatisthisthing and remembered this tower and its mysterious circular window thingies.  it stumped me, and so far everyone over at witt too.
does anyone know what they are and what they're for?
thank you!
wild guess : mirrors to see below / above because the window is too small to actually get an angle?
it's an art project from ex machina
[the barracks] (
ex machina webcam. the webcam is located on the roof of the old fire hall at 103, dalhousie street in quebec city, now housing ex machina's creation center. you will have two minutes to control the camera, after which somebody else will take the turn. if nobody else is waiting to use the camera, you will be able to continue using it as you wish.
or maybe the opposite? to reflect light inside the building? 
forgot to congratulate you on your wedding! :) come back anytime!
not sure if it's still working cause the link is redirected to the main website
this is my guess too. bring light in.
hey, i recognize this room there, it's the one in which nothing ever works. next to the other for which it is the same.
"" we want to bring back the good years of the palace and the palladium "
don't get wrong… i like to see beautiful projects born in quebec. but bringing those old models back there… not sure. i have known these 2 places and i am not bored of them. another case that puzzles me: in "phase 3": investment of 1.2 million and 50 jobs created. truly ? 50 jobs ?? where does it come from? did he say a figure the same?
it's not at all the kind of place that i frequent, but it seems to me that those for whom it is the case complained of not having had much choice in quebec for a few years. so much the better if it can bring in little diversity in the entertainment offer in quebec!
le dagobert and le maurice have proven that the nightclubs in quebec are over.
i'll go if there's disco. not the taste of a dagobert # 2
i liked the circle in time, ms yes: /
don't you like the world dancing in cages?
lol if you have known the palace and the palladium i hope you miss any bar.

ishhhhh
the gap between her and marchand is thinning quite quickly ...
when i click on the link it says bruno marchand wins the town hall of quebec. did they call the winner too early?
not elected yet! marchand leads by 300.
whoops
can't wait to find out what her mystery position on the third link is now that she's elected.
loll the article takes it elsewhere xd
do not.
put some on. first time i see this. i thought they were quick to announce his victory, but i figured they had to know what they were doing. poor her for the speech anyway. it's one thing to think you've won in your own corner, but it's another to claim victory in the public square.
yes.
we'll never know.
interesting to see that it is tightening. my two favorites, rousseau and smith, are far behind. but hey, as long as gosselin doesn't come home.
i have never been so undecided about a vote in my life. at first i was very interested in transition quebec, but the first surveys depressed me. i became interested in marchand because of his cv, which i find very good. but rousseau and smith also look very good. worse the days when i'm frue against the stupid tram (often), i want to vote for quebec 21 to have a project a little less silly. but damn it tempted me to elect friends from radio x.
the only one i've ever thought of voting for is savard. i was neutral at first but the fact that she thought the bus was free was a slap in the face.
i would just like transition quebec to undertake to carry out a new study of the best mode of transport in quebec to follow the recommendations of the bape 😞
thanks reddit for reading my citizen complaints.
the results of the two polls seem quite different to me ... the number of undecided people is increasing. it might not be a freepass for savard after all.
bruno marchand seems a little more reasonable than the others
radio canada's municipal debate is available in full on youtube. i just listened to it, the format was good. it confirmed my choice for the elections.
gosselin could quickly level off, he was the only one known in the race. rousseau and smith will divide the same electorate, unfortunately. smith at 4% with the ton of signs and an active militant base, that surprises me a bit.
same for me, i found so ridiculous kid, merchant and savard during the radio-canada debate. another election where my vote will be wasted.

the trader's resume like the guy who ran the student café when i was at cegep?
ok...
i think that we would gain, democratically, to have councilors from each of the 5 parties, and that the mayor's / mayor's party does not have a majority in the councilors ...
i assume you don't live near the future tram
great, i wanted to listen to it at the end of the week! the link for others: 
> smith at 4% with a ton of signs and an active militant base, that surprises me a bit.
i hope we will be surprised. maybe not 70%, but 10-15% would be good.
yes. i just don't see the benefits of the streetcar. the gain in speed, frequency and comfort will be marginal. very little modal shift to be expected. the construction will be horrible and the wooded avenues will lose a lot of their charm (a probably exaggerated example: 
the cost is always shown as the big argument against the metro but in fact it is not much more than the tram, especially considering the durability.  in addition, the bape is of the opinion that the costs of the tram were underestimated in the initial study (source:  news / 1748088 / report-bape-tramway-devoil-metro-quebec-labeaume).
i really have the impression that with the exponential progression of climate change, all cities in the world are not far from having to follow the example of paris (and others) and drastically reduce the number of cars on the roads (i believe that in paris you can only drive one day out of two depending on whether you have an even or odd number plate). here we will look fine in 2028 with a tram that assumed a modal shift of just a few percent.
in short… all that to say that although i am very convinced of the metro, i do not trust gosselin and his team of climate skeptics at all to carry it out. hence the indecision!
i was mainly talking about his years at centraide, which he seems to have led very well, but yes, his time at cégep de ste-foy is a point in his favor, a member of my family worked with him at that time and has nothing but good to say. i thought it was a change to have someone who comes from the community, it was closer to my values.
such
the problem is presence and charisma. she does not have the makings of a mayor, unfortunately.
do not quote "the study" of metrodequebec, the costs of a metro are about 10 times a tram (which is not dug) and that everywhere in the world. as long as you dig, it's very, very expensive. also, we have to compare north american prices, because that's what our projects cost here.
it's a common anti-transit tactic, they want to offer you the perfect solution, lie to you about costs, tell you the metro will be much better. finally when a serious study is made for the costs ... boom, ah bin finally we do not have the money to cancel.
this is why the rem is almost entirely above ground in montreal and why the cdp tries at all costs to avoid digging in the city center, they know that the prices are astronomical.
the same is happening in toronto, the pro-auto lobby pushed the metro to the limit, saying that it would be the same price .. they changed the lrt (tram) project for a metro, and finally we ended up with a extension of the metro which is 10 times shorter in number of km than if we had had an lrt. far fewer people will have access to rapid transit.
don't let perfect be the enemy of good...
gosselin has no conviction or credibility with his metro, it's just a way to postpone all this to the greek calendar.
for the rest, i agree that a metro would be more efficient, but you have to go one step at a time, the perfect solution is the enemy of the common good here. we can't wait to have something, even if it's just the tram, so that the people of quebec have a tank detox.
precisely, that's his problem: he spent his time at the centraide begging for money from others and being told by little ladies in cocktails how beautiful he is worse and it went to his head to the point that he thinks he is capable of being mayor. it's reflected in his campaign, he talks to talk, he throws up ideas but he never has any idea how he's going to achieve them. the more the campaign goes by, the more he adopts the tone of gosselin or he goes up in the curtains for everything and nothing, once again without proposing concrete fuck all.
neither linguistic talents. let's face it, to be mayor of quebec, he makes exemplary french speak.
i know members of the i'm going by metro group and they are very far from being climate skeptics who want to screw up any public transport project.
the original systra tram study cited costs of 150m / km for the underground portion of the tram. i do not see why this cost could not be used to estimate the costs of a metro.
i agree that at the start of the campaign, qff's commitments were good but a little empty, like nice words without concrete actions. i think it got better during the campaign. of course, they do not have the same knowledge of the realities of the city as savard or other people who have worked there for a long time, but it is not necessary to manage it well.
for my part, i would be ready to forgive a french who is not exemplary. this is the tone that is not appropriate in my opinion. a bit like gosselin. you're not talking to your boyfriends, you want to represent a city.
i congratulate you in your desire to want to learn french, indeed the best way is immersion. i suggest you look for expat groups on facebook, there are a lot of people who live in quebec who are learning french. here you are more likely to find people helping tourists :) good research!
thank you! unfortunately, i do not participate in "the book of faces": p
well you don't miss that much :d i don't remember the name of the platform but there's a get together app that allow that kind of meeting. meetup i think.
the cost of living perhaps? gaming is strong in quebec but it has nothing to do with montreal.
i see it too. i believe that it is mainly a financial decision, the cost of living being much cheaper in quebec. especially at the property level, in toronto your 1 bedroom condo will cost you 750k while for that price in quebec you practically have a mansion lol.
probably several other reasons, but:
* real estate prices: even if prices have risen in quebec, it's even crazier in toronto. near downtown worst dump is probably worth> $ 1million just for the location.
* mobility: since covid, several companies, particularly in tech, will allow employees to work from anywhere. it is therefore possible to have a salary in toronto, with a cost of living in quebec quite easily.
* help for families: when it comes to starting a family, there are still some serious advantages to consider ... more favorable paternity leave here, more affordable daycare.
and a lot of posts in english too…?
i also have the impression! no doubt because of the cost of living and teleworking.
we must be welcoming, without compromising our language and our culture

the 3m snow banks are charming. shoveling in the aftermath of a storm is a change from the daily grind. it's less annoying than having to put a habanero up your ass.
beautiful shots!
there’s a walk through experience that started today until july 25 (où tu vas quand tu dors en marchant). it’s free and a really nice activity! i go every year and always appreciate it 
museums have opened from what i've heard, and there are a bunch of activites outside that are worthwhile right now. 
mnbaq is good (fine art stuff), but i really like the civilization museum
there is a oh shit exhibition at the civ museum that looks completely crazy right now
i think there's a picasso expo now at the mnbaq
saw that last week. i have to go see that.
there us indeed, i've heard good comments
you can fart on a seat and it will analyze it. 
i have to go with my kids

cute
6.2f it cost bell 4 billion in 2012 to fiberize the upper town, i can't wait to see the estimate for the entire town
my god that seems perfect to me.
i plan to move to italy or costa rica in the next 5 years but if the political parties of quebec had this kind of program, it would make me think twice before moving.
honestly they have a great mobilizing force and i think their clear position against the third link will allow them to stand out. i was really not convinced at first when the party was formed, but i am impressed by their work on the ground. they are well on their way to electing a few councilors, at least in the city center.
anyone have any thoughts on mme. savard? responsible for regional planning, town planning and heritage files. it seems to me that on this side things are going smoothly in the city.
personally, i don't have a precise opinion on ms. savard, but in terms of land use planning and heritage, we could do better. the city has presented beautiful plans for development to be done in a coherent, sustainable and respectful manner, but the plan is crushed at the slightest opportunity when a real estate developer has an idea that deviates from it. the city did not manage to preserve much of the built heritage either under the reign of labeaume.
wow, talk about a wrong time to visit. due to covid quebec city is currently in orange level (we just got out of the red level). which means:
- proof of quebec city residency is required to eat in a restaurant
- the curfew is at 21:30. anybody outside later than that can get get a fine (and the fines are salty!)
-  museums are open at reduced capacity (mask and distanciation are mandatory)
- same thing with stores.
old quebec is beautifull and you can walk around it for hours. this being a touristy place not speaking french should not be a problem if you're nice about it.
hey! you won’t be able to eat in restaurants etc without proof of quebec residency.
it might be an issue if you're going to non-touristy places. uptown and the old city are totally bilingual, if you go to the big malls like place laurier or galeries de la capitale, you'll be able to find an employee who speaks english and if you go to tourist hot spots outside the city they will have staff that can speak english. but if you want to go outside those zones or places it's going to be harder to find someone who can speak understandable english.
i've visited many times, mostly sticking to the old city and it's never been a problem. most locals are friendly especially if you show you're trying to make an effort / are being polite. tourism is a big thing and most people are used to foreign languages.
french won't be an issue if you are in the city. most people working service are used to speak english.
old québec is where you'll find the classic european charme.
quartier saint roch is full a small restaurants and bar ( if they are open by then). it used to be sketchy but now its full on gentrified.
most winter activities will be over by then but the warmer weather will make for nice hikes. but our mountains are less epic then the rockies.
i could go on if you tell me more about your interests
aside from the old city and the plaines dabraham (it's worth the time to walk in that big park), there's the museum (need to buy your ticket in advance), there's ile d'orleans that might have a few stores open on weekends, the drive is pretty during the day.
i think you should postpone your trip.
everyone talked about the city so i will try and show you the other stuff.
1_ chute montmorency : 10min drive, beautiful waterfall that will be frozen at this time of the year
2_ parc de la jacques cartier : 45 min drive, there are a lot of gorgeous hiking trails over there. stunning views
3_ mont sainte-anne: 30min drive, closest place to have a ski day with the view of l'ile d'orléans and le saint laurent
there would be alot more things in summer.
besides the places already listed by others, i like to take visitors to [ and [ but it seems they're closed for now due to covid, but check it a day or two before coming to see if somethings changes.
for real? what are the rules at the moment for those visiting quebec?
what?! why?!
yes. i visited trois rivères for my work and was not allowed to eat in restaurants as i am a resident of quebec city.
to avoid the movement / arrival of people between the more at risk areas to the less risky areas, and thereby reduce transmission.
je ne sais pas. it’s to discourage people from travelling i think.
the comments that come with this tweet are a real trash fire.
it keeps the face warm.
o.k.
in winter, it is also recommended to wear a helmet in town ...
classic, with the orange cones in addition. there is no more quebecer than that lol
let's get out covered!
wais there are shady comments worthy of bot example:
"one more way to demonstrate our respect for the health of others and our gratitude towards the workers of the health network"
seriously i can't believe people are stooges at this point.
its depends on the street xd
yo you're so independent and rebellious. wow. a true free thinker.
well correct that. let them do what it takes to survive until spring when we finally (i hope!) come out of this pandemic.
i no longer believe in plandemia. besides, this covid story is ridiculous. it's just the flu.
fuck the same!
if people had respected the sanitary measures around june july we would still have our weather discounts.
also less deaths and all the kit, but damn, dla poutine 25% off!
and that's why you're part of the problem, so go say that in the face of those families who have a limb attached to a ventilator. :)
there's english service in basically every public service, so that won't be an issue (unless you're a dick about it, much like 100% of the stories you hear about québec lol).
if you have their address, it should be alright. you can contact the local police department if it's an urgent or criminal issue, and they should be able to give you different references if they can't help.
1-855-641-6311
i would recommend that your friend call 811 if he or she can. it is a way to reach social services in quebec. it is called info social, available in french and english. the social worker will evaluate the situation, help and support your friend with public or community resources. if your friend is suffering from abuse, they will help with legal protection. you are an amazing friend, thanks for reaching out, we are here if you need more information.
have your friend try this:
since the jeffery hale emergency is closed, english-speaking clients who would normally have gone to the jeff for medical care in their language are now invited to call 418-684-5333, ext. 11805, between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., monday to friday. leave your name and phone number, and the liaison nurse from jeffery hale community services will call you back to assess your situation and refer you to a local clinic that can provide bilingual services if required. before calling this liaison service, please assure that you do not have access to your family doctor or have flu-like symptoms. if you have flu-like symptoms, please call 811. for urgent care, call 911 or go to the emergency closest to you.
thank you so much
thank you so much
thank you!
she could also call 211.
thank you very much!
yes, indeed. if i may add something, 211 also have a website in english, an online chat (and a service in 200 other languages): [
811 is the governmental portal. 211 is more centered on community resources.
you cannot call 811 or 211 outside quebec though.
yeah 211 is basically local (regions) social community ressources. 
what op's friend needs is basically to get in touch with her clsc and see if they can send someone for daily visits.
do you want to walk with me in the old town?
hello, please help me practice my french.
just ask politely? if you do this in quieter/slower times, it really shouldn’t be a problem i’d say. 
your mileage can vary depending on the place or the individuals more than because of the request itself.
good luck!
just ask, it won't bother them unless you are in rush hour.
the others have already answered, but if you want to practice you can also start by writing your posts in french, we won't blame you for making mistakes;)
don't hesitate to ask them, they should be absolutely alright with that. i always appreciated people who asked me to speak french with them. i just adjusted my tone and speed to be better understood than with my very fast usual pace.
that used to happen all the time for me when i first moved here. i'd insist explaining that i wanted to practice my french, this would sometimes yield the desired effect, while most often it resulted in the person insisting that *they* wanted to practice their english instead (resulting in a quick agreement that i'd speak french and they'd speak english so we both could practice.)
the one place where people always refused to speak french with me is in vieux-québec, though.
nowadays, no one responds to me in french anymore, as i think my french accent got better, with the exception of le vieux-québec. to this day, as soon as they hear an accent, they'll switch to english and no amount of asking will make them switch back. one guy explained it once: they get loads of tourists who want to practice their french and that slows everything down.
say what you mean and don't say it mean
venture outside of the vieux quebec walls.
i don’t know where to get them, but i know i’ve seen people with macarons(?) that said i want to practice my french please talk to me in french, or something like that. it was really useful to know it wasn’t impolite to talk to them in french.
when i was working in retail, it was a pleasure to me when some anglos asked me to speak french with them so they could practice. it is not rude at all.
i just keep speaking french. sometimes one of those auto replies will leak out (thanks, cheers), but i just stay french as much as possible when  they switch to english.
i just want to say thank you all for such friendly, detailed responses!
if there is a stress moment it will be easier for them to handle it in english - but if you want to practice just learn how to say you want to practice to be a good immigrant and make papa legault happy
there are two major dailies in quebec. the slightly more intellectual center-left newspaper [le soleil] ( and the somewhat populist right-wing newspaper [journal de québec] ( but where do you get from to not know that?
le devoir, on the left and pro-independence.
le devoir: a light sovereignist left tendency
the press and the sun: federalist right trend
le journal de montréal (or de québec): tabloids right-wing sovereignist tendency
otherwise, we say a journal and newspapers and weird
in quebec itself? the sun is on the left and the journal de québec which tends more to the right.
probably from canada
> the press and the sun: federalist right trend
lolwut? federalist yes but right? let's see!
stéphanie grammond being the worst of the gang.
oh yeah, she might be, but overall it's a leftist newspaper in my opinion.
members of the desmarais family laugh in their bank accounts on the islands.
seriously, it is the most politically and economically right-wing daily in quebec.
pro liberals, pro religion, pro federalist, it does a lot to the right.
let's agree to disagree ;)
north arm valley
la mestachibo
the mont-wright in stoneham is nice
hautes gorges park?
really soft but very close; mount bélair
mont sainte-anne
southern massif
mount ste anne
well it says it was demolished, but i suspect it was [here](
according to wikipedia it would be there;
46°48'58.2"n 71°12'23.7"w
edit: link was incorrect. it is now pointing to the right. location.
the doors use to have some space to live inside. they were use as a shelter for the garrison family at some times.
quebec city
how did you find anything about this on wikipedea?
with this article (french only);
worse it seems.
i work in a pit of sand and concrete ...
but the environment comes after jobs. fuckin legault.
\*laugh in air conditioning\*
legault, solely responsible ...
no, but he is the prime minister we have now and he should do what is right for the people.
they could broadcast it so much on the giant screen of the telus stadium at laval university, that would be awesome, you can sit on the field or in the stands while respecting the distance!
pub du parvis broadcasts it generally on the terrace. and it's a pedestrian street.
\ * pedestrian on weekends
i watched the match of june 24 on their terrace: it was not worse and the atmosphere was good
there is a lot of work going on right now, it seems to me. there is only space on each side to access the shops
the parvis side is still pedestrian i think? côté st-joseph is the weekend.
you're right on the forecourt side, the pedestrian crossing is narrow on the other hand
it already seems to fly higher than what we had a few years ago with david lemelin or even jf gosselin today. can't wait to learn more.
câline, it was therefore quite empty for an interview.
jf gosselin, it's worrying to see such a successful demagogue
small reminder of the parties competing for the municipal elections in quebec on november 7, 2021:
- [team labeaume] (
- [québec 21](
- [démocratie québec] (
- [transition québec] ( (formerly option capitale nationale)
- [quebec strong and proud] (
yes.
[deleted]
we still have to take the hat off to him for having decided to take the “flat” opposition job compared to denis coderre who went cycling instead.
in fact in the municipal there are 2 votes, one for the mayor and the other for your municipal councilor, so labeaume or gosselin does not really run in a district
a candidate for mayor does not have a district, unlike a party leader at the provincial or federal level. if he is not elected mayor, he has no post. the concept of colostier · era does not exist in the other 2 levels.
intercar seem to have resumed service since the end of february, you should find a route that goes to beaupré :)
i don't know if it can work for you: 
seriously, if you have to get home from afar and you can't get there before 8 p.m., what do you do?
can you at least dispute the ticket if we give you one?
i can see nothing but taking the first orleans express bus to the palace station and then a taxi from there.
if you're looking for rtc buses, sorry there aren't any that go to beaupré.
there was a train going to charlevoix but i don't believe it has been in operation since covid. but it can be an avenue to explore ...
i think that when you have a valid reason, the majority of police officers are tolerant.
hahhahaha!
new is modern and bland. but old buildings are protected. if you renovate your historical building, you are obligated to keep the same outside appearance.
no. and the bland lack of taste of the current three or four big real estate developers is to blame.
it’s a huge problem. there’s no monetary incentive to try and make nice things if you don’t have to. while i admire those rich people who have a bold weird vision and take the risk, we don’t much of that here. 
so instead, most new buildings are rectangular, grey. without much character or charm. they’re something you could find anywhere really. and it’s harming the fee of the city. the fresk tower in the st roch area is a real eye sore. a ton of projects in the suburb area called st foy are also testament to that.
i don’t know how qc could move away from this trend. it’s not easy, because it’s not cheap to build nice things - particularly if you want to given them a historical cachet. i’m just glad there are protected areas that avoid stunning houses from getting torn down and replaced with concrete monsters
i think there’s a good balance between the old quebec and the ‘new’ quebec architectures. i have lived here in this city all my life and i’ve seen much efforts and money spent on keeping our historic european roots alive in this huge north american anglophone reality. so often old european architecture is not very compatible with modern lifestyle, narrow streets made of cobblestones and old european house structures are just not appropriate for our times anymore, plus they are a real and constant fire hazard. i would say that the old quebec borough and some of its surroundings have some very strict architectural laws, many of them very costly but necessary, and that’s what is most important for keeping our european architectural identity alive. quebec city got much bigger in the last 10 years, the metro area is near enough one million population with a very dynamic business community. new challenges arise from diverse ethnic groups and architectures. and of course here’s always room for improvement.
yup. fortunately, the most recent municipal buildings have, for the most part, a good architectural value (for example the monique-corriveau library, the house of literature, etc.). fortunately also that the city seems to show a real interest in the safeguard and the development of the built heritage. if only the town planning rules were going in the same direction for new private constructions
thats so sad to hear. 
here in toronto developers are tearing down all the old buildings - we have very few left. a couple of weeks ago a developer (allegedly) committed arson on a heritage building so he could build one of those bland glass boxes. 
i think the only way anything could change is if the city both here and in quebec made a by-law that all buildings in a certain area should have a facade that borrows from the older architecture already there
here he'd have to rebuild it as it was if it was heritage. which can be very costly.

> empty bus ... what a surprise.
the weekend, in a storm, in a pandemic? it's certain.
in the "least surprising news of all time" category: d
well deserved anyway
it's like a parody of himself. it's like the bloc pot of municipal politics, fixed on one thing, one issue.
talk about a completely disconnected guy!
find yourself a gosselin job!
what a visionary! no more concrete.
i refuse to believe it's not a joke or something. radio-canada was hacked by a group of satirical news.
i don't understand anything he says: i don't speak mongolian
i know who not to vote for.
the chances of him being elected are as great as the gap between those eyes
at the same time, i don't find it so cave as reading the title. i would start with the sub-river sub-river link. worse after a few years, if the demand is still there (hopefully not), we can still build a bridge in the east for trucks etc.
do you blame yourself for the links? kin! 1 link! 2 links! 3 links!
what if we started by proving that it would be useful, before all the wacky and more expensive assumptions than each other?
a link for every citizen of quebec!
well there it is for sure that i follow you, but hey, i would stop any heavy infrastructure project for a few years to see how mobility adjusts to teleworking ... unfortunately no party seems to join me on this. !
did you wait 5 minutes for a red light to go shopping? vla a tunnel below!
last election, i loved the rhino party guy's plan to buy a helicopter for each family that was going to use the 3rd link. it was cheaper than the 3rd link.
the question was asked here 2 years ago.
 [
it's not all good to read, but you're asking a political question on reddit, so i guess you know what you're getting into.
in my opinion, as an economics student, it is the strength of several economic myths that are still popular in the suburbs of quebec that encourage people to vote conservative. i'll leave it to sociologists or political scientists why it's concentrated in the suburbs, but my guess would be that the vast majority are white, well-off, with good jobs and stable family backgrounds. so little exposed to other realities.
the economic myths that are popular are:
\ -trickle down economics. the rich create wealth.
\ -ecological actions are systematically at the expense of economic growth
\ -the laffer curve. too much tax kills tax.
\ -canadian public debt is a huge burden
\ -poor people don't make good decisions with their money.
the conservatives are not elected in the city, but in the suburbs. toronto has the same dynamic. montreal would surely have the same dynamic if the bloc did not exist.
the world is rich
... how to say, quebec is partly a city of civil servants. money wasted, they see it all on many levels almost every day. they see it with their eyes or with a loved one (friend, relative, colleagues). the employment rate by a government agency is very high (i cannot find a source to confirm this)
do you think you want more government or more money in different ministries after each election? do you think you want another reform that will change everything all over again after another election?
i lived my first 18 years of life in the greater quebec city region and this is the most logical and easy-to-understand explanation for this phenomenon.
it's simple, people vote conservative because they are afraid of change and strangers. it is even more obvious when you are in the majority well-off white and you refuse to give up your place to young people and / or immigrants and / or poor and / or women and / or native americans ...
fire arms. all parties want to keep gun owners in jail. except one. simple process of elimination. hunting and fishing and other "conservative / country" hobbies are very popular.
also, in general, big companies / big hits / entrepreneurs are respected. the ndp wants to call someone who earns $ 200,000 a rich person, that is a joke. entrepreneurs don't want their success to be capped so low.
they don't vote ppc because they're not so cave.
working class manipulated by hyper-conservative radio stations that make them believe that we are poor, miserable and that it is the fault of the poorest and the government
it must nevertheless be said that gérard deltell would pass hands down regardless of the party ...
many small entrepreneurs and family smes. we have an emerging petty bourgeoisie. the aging of the population keeps the unemployment rate low. it gives the impression that right-wing politics are working, at least for the white middle class that lives in debt. that and the general xenophobia / traditionalism of quebec outside montreal. montreal is so in a cultural and economic bubble that it should be counted as a country in its own right. in 20 years we will see the return of unemployment and the appearance of an ultrariche class and the disappearance of the middle class and it will be like in the usa or india.
i would like to answer each of your myths ...
trickle down economics. the rich create wealth: if not, who creates the government? they can certainly create wealth by the government but as a civil servant i can assure you that it is everyone's money and therefore nobody's money and it is thus very badly spent.
\ -ecological actions are systematically at the expense of economic growth: maybe not systematically but in general yes ... it takes more expensive technologies a tesla cost more than a toyota.
\ -the laffer curve. too much tax kills tax: i don't see how we can disagree with that if the tax is small i won't take the risk of doing a moonlighting job, but if it's too big i'll do it ...
\ -the canadian public debt is an immense burden: 2 years ago it was debatable today it is quite a fact ... a small economic crisis and the gdp / interest ratio will not be really good.
the poor don't make good decisions with their money: it's still generally true, poor has nothing to do with income a lot of people who make in the six figures spend too much. it is rare in the poor world who do voluntary simplicity.
> toronto has the same dynamic
not in 2015, 2019, or 2021. canada's conservatives have problems in the <<905>>,
> montreal would surely have the same dynamic if the bloc did not exist.
why in the suburbs of quebec these not the bloc?
el world? like everyone? (sorry, i'm an english speaker from toronto)
i am a civil servant and i confirm ... people at $ 85,000 a year to sleep in their office or unnecessary equipment to be bought for no reason other than `` we have a free budget '' i have seen too many (before the pandemic)...
it's funny because as we become like other big “woke” cities, everyone's quality of life will drop. and many will defend that.
my grandfather is an immigrant, that was true in the 1970s. values are the problem. the majority of people do not want to see veiled women because their understanding is that it is a sign of submission to her husband, representing what modern quebec has fought with great effort.
i am happy with your answer that allows me to elaborate a little. but at the same time each subject is complex and i have other things to do today!
1. all economic agents create wealth by working. nurse, civil servant, notary, gum salesman. however a person will spend x percent of his income. the richer you are, the less you spend in relation to your income. so the rich person will save / invest more. it may seem counterintuitive, but to maximize production, we don't want people to save (up to a certain limit, of course). there is a lot of theoretical notion here, especially the principle of wealth creation which is not zero sum gain which is not such an easy principle to understand.
and i would also add that empirically we see that the trickle down economics does not work. just on the wikipedia page you will find several proofs of its failure.
2. in your example, we still have a notion of: how is wealth to be created? to make the math easy. let's say that the electric car (ev) and the gas car (vg) have exactly the same production cost of $ 50,000, forget the costs to drive and say they are all equal. how much are we quebecers prepared to pay for these cars? probably more for the ve. just because she's green. so let's say $ 55,000 for the vg and $ 60,000. well, an additional $ 5,000 has just been created in the economy, just because we place a higher value on the greener good. your cost, which is higher, also means wealth creation. again this is counterintuitive.
[and of course, there is the notion that it will cost a lot of money to make dikes to save new york from rising waters.] ( /europe-climate-change-cost.html?_hsenc=p2anqtz-9mryjgnr8q3cr-r76qo0vgb_p1cxhvelvwh5h2966ff9jtreemosht4pue7acuatuzwgor-uyeywnsqsmimes_t2ddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd/
3. i do not disagree with the principle, but it does not apply badly in the context of our society. the principle is very present for the recipients of social assistance. we give you $ 8000 per year if you have income equal to 0. if you work and you make $ 3000, we take $ 3000 off your bs. so you are taxed 100% on your additional income. so why would you go to work?
but for pierre-karl péladeau, his wealth is stocks and his income is dividends. whether he pays 33% tax or 50% is he going to try less to invest well? i do not think so. but state revenues will increase quite a bit.
4. interest rates are low so debt service is inexpensive and our credit rating is among the best in the world. our debt is lower relative to our gdp than the usa. you have to compare yourself, because that's exactly how investors think. if the government hadn't spent so much during the last crisis, the denominator (gdp) would drop dramatically which is worse than the numerator. so it's keynesian economics, in times of crisis you have to spend. the problem is not our debt at the moment when the weather is gray, but it is what we will do with when the weather is nice.
5. i referred to the myths that if we give money (a ubi for example) the poor will buy lottery and drugs, so you might as well not give them. it is to prevent the collective well-being because some people are drug addicts (for example).
in fact, what angers me is that we blame the poor more than the rich. for example, everyone is shouting about the pcu but nobody talks about that in times of crisis the canadian billionaires got richer by 76 billion (and this is only due to the monetary policy of the bank of canada).
i don't know how well you think you answered his myths, but basically i find it funny that you think you are educating someone who claims to be an economics student on economic myths. in addition with little anecdote which rather confirmed his main thesis:
> the vast majority are white, well-off, with a good job and a stable family background. so little exposed to other realities.
i suggest you maybe do a little reading, thomas piketty is a good source for a historical economic inequality analysis. economic inequalities are not an accident because of the myths described above, they are a creation / function of our system.
i will let op who is an economist answer you more rigorously but i will comment on your points from what i know.
> \ - trickle down economics. the rich create wealth: if not, who creates the government? they can certainly create wealth by the government but as a civil servant i can assure you that it is everyone's money and therefore nobody's money and it is thus very badly spent.
indeed, there is an "institutionalist" theory which says that it is the government which creates the wealth and they have good arguments. personally, i don't know who creates the wealth, but i know it's not the rich anyway. for me, someone who works in a mcdonald's creates a lot more "wealth for the nation" than someone who has never worked in his life and who lives with the dividends of his inheritance ...
> \ - ecological actions are systematically at the expense of economic growth: perhaps not systematically but in general yes ... it takes more expensive technologies a tesla cost more than a toyota.
the world often forgets the economic cost of exploiting the environment on future generations. how much does it cost the country to consume a non-renewable resource that has taken millions of years to form? how much does it cost to release a kg of co2 into the atmosphere when you know that its capacity is limited? and most importantly, who pays these costs? it's not the companies in any case ...
if we integrate these costs and think a little about the medium / long term, ecological actions are always very profitable economically.
> \ - laffer's curve. too much tax kills tax: i don't see how we can disagree with that if the tax is small i won't take the risk of doing a moonlighting job, but if it's too big i'll do it ...
it is very simplistic in reasoning. a justified high tax rate (which offers excellent services with) is generally accepted by the populations. cf the nordic countries where they can have rates of 70% on the upper brackets but with very little tax evasion. the answer therefore depends on the context.
> \ - the canadian public debt is an immense burden: 2 years ago it was debatable today it is quite a fact ... a small economic crisis and the gdp / interest ratio will not be really good.
the gdp / interest ratio is just a political argument that has no real economic basis. (debt) crises do not come from a high debt ratio but from the confidence of the markets in an economy and this can happen even in a low debt economy.
we must not forget that the state debt is an important engine in an economy and in some cases, a surplus budget can even slow it down (not to be confused with a trade surplus, which is always beneficial)
the state budget is very different from the budget of an average business. debt does not mean the same for a commercial bank vs. a central bank. and having a ton of debt is not necessarily a bad thing, especially if this debt is invested in sustainable infrastructure that is useful for the economy.
> the poor do not make good decisions with their money: it is still true in general, poor has nothing to do with income many people who make in the 6 figures spend too much. it is rare in the poor world who do voluntary simplicity.
what is better to spend on you? invest your money? to buy a house? hire a wealth manager to manage your assets?
it's easy to make good decisions with your money when you can put more than half of your income aside. conversely, you have other priorities when your budget is within 5piasse ...
what are we complaining about anyway? the poor spend on credit and above all they remain poor. and all this is good for the economy (of the rich).
[deleted]
ok haha sorry.
people in the quebec city region are on average educated, they hold good jobs, and there are a large number of civil servants.
they are therefore rather comfortable on the $$$ side. this pushes them to like the system in place and want to keep it ...
everybody's old and rich.
i won't even get into these typical images.
i'm talking about an unfinished pilot project that is not applied across the province for political reasons most of the time.
i can't wait for a new retiree to write a book on the history of the directorate general of information technologies (dgti) within the ministry of health and social services (msss). forty years of innovation and non-innovation in information technology, software and companies. there are things to be clarified and made public for sure.
how to get off?
sacred beautiful answer and i really like your reading of the quebec case. very uniform cultural adherence to certain myths conveyed by the radio, around a bbq, which are ultimately a societal meme. and yes, the homogeneity of quebec has something to do with it.
i agree with the idea, it is the one i will use when i am told about the quebec mystery.
> economic inequalities are not an accident because of the myths described above, they are a creation / function of our system.
50 years of meritocracy has severely segmented the population. who would've believed that.
> what is better to spend on you? invest your money? to buy a house? hire a wealth manager to manage your assets?
good question
> the poor spend on credit and above all they remain poor.
you just answered your question.
there isn't a phone kiosk that sells (finances) more overpriced phones than those in less educated / advantaged places
hmmm generally these are educated people watching the mp and looking for someone centrist who is against trudeau. they think the conservatives are the most successful economically because when they look at stephen harper they think the economy is doing well. they are also able to say that climate change will not be resolved with us, nor with the major parties, rather developing the necessary technologies and investing in them. for them, it is not a question of if, but rather of how.
in addition that their deputies are not so extreme social level, it becomes ok to vote conservative since officially there is not voting against the rights of others.
if you live in quebec without being able to answer that you should move to montreal or toronto.
[deleted]
conservative mps like joël godin or gérard deltell are politicians very popular with the local population.
they are present in their ridings and are very visible ... but they represent the conservatives
in this article, the graphs show that the federal debt reduced after the election of the liberals and supported by the conservatives until the economic crisis of 2008. we can also see trudeau's efforts which have no consequences on the economy. debts, which even makes it worse. for the centrist argument, it's not me who thinks that. i talk about my experience with my conservative voting family. personally, i think they are on the centrist right, while the liberals are on the centrist left. not a big difference on what they're going to do because they're just going to be fighting over the little details.
[deleted]
forgive me, you assume that i was talking about 2020 when since 2015 the debt has been increasing. also, although the left is generally better, trudeau is just an incompetent. trudeau's government is not good because of its ideology, just because they are not well trained. canada's gdp spiked with stephen harper, dropping with increasing debt efforts. but trudeau, the post-2017 descent comes with a spike in debt. source:
in my opinion, the ndp would be better because trudeau does everything in half to be the least offensive, taking all the faults of all the systems.
i cannot say that i am educated, but i can say one thing and that is that your way of coming out with the argument that we are less educated is impressive. your arguments are not accompanied by numbers, articles, and even go against you (as for the gdp). you have assumed a lot, without reading what i said. if you really have a point, pull out the numbers why trudeau is a good prime minister.
this tone .... this condescension.
it depends on what you are looking for.
if you are looking for a house or a quality of life in the suburbs style but close to the city: ste-foy is the winner. there is still access to interesting shops, rue maguire and myrand are popular too.
for a neighborhood life (not being dependent on your car / bus for work, shopping and cultural, social leisure, etc.). jean-baptiste, saint-sauveur, saint-roch, limoilou and montcalm is very good.
the old one is not worth so much, it is expensive and you have no business (groceries ++). your neighborhood is invaded by tourists and your neighbors are airbnb.
montcalm is super beautiful, calm and a great neighborhood life (rue cartier, plains of abraham, mnbaq, and much more). easy parking in general too. but, your neighborhood is invaded during the big festivals (carnival, feq, etc.). against your loved ones from the big festivales. it is one of the most expensive neighborhoods.
st-jean baptiste is like the old one, but much more livable. access to good shops and a good neighborhood life. difficult parking +/-.
st-roch is downtown. in the process of being gentrified, so sometimes the prices = / quality of apartment, and owners who are looking to make cash on the popularity of the neighborhood. it remains really good as a neighborhood if you like living in a former working-class neighborhood. your pretty close to the action and lots of shops
saint-sauveur is quite a residential downtown area, large apartments for reasonable prices are always available. quieter than st-roch, but still close to the action. several beautiful shops are located on rue st-vallier, and there are good little shops hidden in the neighborhood. fairly easy parking.
limoilou is like a small montreal, the architecture is pretty much the same. beautiful neighborhood life, lots of commerce, a neighborhood full of trees. fairly easy parking. still reasonable price. a little far from your workplace
i have never lived in montcalm but the people i know who live there really love the experience.
i lived in sainte-foy during my studies. i enjoyed it but, with the university and the cegeps, it's really a student corner, especially in rental housing. you still have easy access to beautiful shops and shopping centers on the other hand.
saint-roch, i have an acquaintance who lived there and really didn't like it. housing in poor condition for much too expensive. that being said, it's really downtown and you're close to everything.
if you have the choice between sainte-foy and montcalm, i lean towards montcalm.
saint-jean-baptiste is cheaper than montcalm and less far than st-roch, it might be a compromise that would suit you.
charlesbourg / beauport there are also metrobuses.
what corner are you going to work in?
if you are in the city center, parking is not always easy.
if you want to stay car-free, make sure you are near an 800-80x network. if i were single, i would probably go live in montcalm, it's pretty much the most beautiful place to stay in quebec, no need for a car and close to everything. but definitely one of the most expensive places in town too. if you are like several other it resources who come to settle in quebec, you will have the means to settle in montcalm; it's expensive for quebec but it's nothing compared to the prices in toronto.
i believe there are a lot of good suggestions here. without a car, but close to shops, the st-jean-baptiste district (outside the walls, a few steps from old quebec), the montcalm district and a little further, saint-sacrement / sillery (rue maguire) are great options. in the lower town, limoilou, st-roch and st-sauveur are great options, often less expensive (although with the revitalization of these neighborhoods ... this is often less the case).
my favorite would be st-jean-baptiste, ** if you don't have a car **: you are near old quebec, the shops are nice, in the upper town, near work, with good transport in common and car-sharing. avoid ste-foy, the prices are higher because of laval university and cégeps (colleges).
my humble contribution to the discussion is not to underestimate the coasts in quebec. there is the lower town and the upper town. the upper town is on a plateau, and we do not see the demarcation on the maps! several new residents discover the topography on site. chemin ste-foy / rue st-jean = upper town. st-paul, st-vallier east, rue arago, boulevard charest = lower town. ;)
our family lives in the lower town, without a car, we climb the odds if necessary, access to the métrobus not too far ... things are going very well, even in winter.
montcalm is the best in my opinion, beautiful, clean, accessible and at the center of everything. i'm living :)
ste-foy not bad especially since you will have access to most of the metrobus routes, the bus line 800/801 is the most developed, it is quite central also if you want to travel in the regions, and the laurel shopping center will be very close.
old quebec is only for tourists; no services, no grocery store no pharmacy, they say it's a 'postcard' looks good in photo but it's not a place to stay
st-roch aka la basse-ville is like our version of a downtown area but very small, there are also some homeless people, but very little compared to toronto .. don't forget that quebec is still a big one village, even in st-roch, on weeknights after 8 p.m. everything will be closed .. (avoid st-sauveur if you can ... even though quebec remains a safe city, it may be the least safe area, someone who stay there could confirm)
you can also look at the old limoilou area, just north of st-roch, i have friends who stay there, it's like the up and coming area this is the time
general rule, in quebec you will need a car, our transport is almost non-existent compared to that of toronto or mtl, our city is quite large so to visit friends or family you may need a car, moreover in winter, waiting for the bus at the stop at -20 in the snow, it's annoying!
hope that helps, and that you will be well here :)
\ +1 all of this. if i could sticky one comment in the top of the sub, it would be this one.
excellent summary
thanks a lot for the help!
ok. thanks for the help. until last april, i was a student so i think i can "fit" in ste-foy. i think there is more youth there?
forget your car even more than montcalm for example.
> which area are you going to work in?
montcalm. south (plains of abraham)
ok. thanks for the help
> general rule, in quebec you will need a car
heh, i don't agree with that.
for my part, i just have a lot of business in town. on foot and by bus it is very well done.
when i really need a tank, uber and communauto do the job en masse and it's a lot cheaper than having a tank.
having a tank in town, i think it doesn't make sense unless you have your own private parking lot. seeing the world pay the vignette to park in their street, only to then have to pay for another parking lot when the city plows snow in winter, it looks like a pocket in criss.
> (avoid st-sauveur if you can ... even though quebec remains a safe city, it may be the least safe area, someone who stays there could confirm)
i would avoid st-roch more than st-sauveur it seems to me.
> 'postcard' looks good in photo but it's not a place to stay
ok i understand. :)
thanks for the help.
> don't forget that quebec remains a big village, even in st-roch
oh ok. interesting. what does that mean, exactly?
> in quebec you will need a car,
ah ok. if i buy a car, i think i'll live in the suburbs and commute every morning. but i'm not really a "car person"; i prefer public transport
lol, nice. you can take my comment, the bonus and add it to a wiki or a faq for the subreddit if you want.
it’s nice. it's cool and charming as a city, i wish you a nice discovery!
oh yes, ste-foy is much "younger"
there are plenty of them in my area, i don't know how they manage to find free spots though.
canada housing sucks less in quebec. keep us posted on your choice!
wow, boff me i pay it, $ 80 / year there is always room and i live on a very busy street, in the winter i do not pay the extra pass, that's the crossseeee fuck that.
yes uber and community if you only stay in town okay
yes, i don't know 100% ... i guess in st roch there is the city, the restaurants and everything and all around, st sauveur is just apartments: /
quebec remains a big village = we are a city of +/- 750,000 people, majority white, french-speaking, etc. compared to toronto, it may be a shock, but we are more and more diverse than before, that is clear.
limoilou is also very "young professional"
on the other hand, when you find a place, you learn to park in parallel on a hill, with two inches of play, in a snow bank, with three cars honking behind you!
indeed, st-sauveur is a collection of apartments. however, there are several nice restaurants and shops here and there. several initiatives try to liven up the district, with the market every saturday at parc durocher among others. to live there, i feel more secure there than in st-roch (where i work). st-sauveur, although in the lower town, remains an interesting alternative. if he is close to marie de l'incarnation, he has access to the 802 which can go up to belvédère easily. he can get by by bus without a car. if he is a fan of cycling, the gentle slope can put him in shape.
> a city of +/- 750,000 people, majority white, french-speaking, etc. compared to toronto, it might be a shock,
oh yes. of course. the 2016 census says that in toronto cma 48% of the people are white; in quebec it is 94%.
> but we are more and more diverse than before
is it because foreign students from francaphone countries stay there? or that the minorities of montreal and other canadian cities move there
i hadn't thought of limoilou. if someone is looking for a "young professional" neighborhood life, this is definitely the place right now. several of my friends are living there at the moment.
> park in parallel on a hill
and then you discover that your hand-held station wagon works lol
i think immigration goes to quebec, just a little later.
for example, i am a teacher in charlesbourg, a "suburb" like ste-foy, and the majority of my students are of foreign origin. it is a big change compared to my youth in the 1990s. they are not only students, but economic immigrants who come from french-speaking countries like morocco, congo or ivory coast.
otherwise, yes, montreal is more multicultural.
why has quebec remained "hermetic" for a long time? answering this question could take an entire evening, but, roughly speaking: once moribund economy, french-speaking majority sometimes difficult to integrate, "second rate" city in canada, cold winter, bill 101, immigration policy different from the federal, etc.
good luck!
you can perhaps write to the ramen collective to ask them the question.
yes! at the house of literature:
there are quite a few at university, anyway. an example: 
thanks for all the suggestions :)
quite certain that tecnic has to offer this
no i wanted the same, i inquired and they told me they were doing more
thank you! i'll check
well it's disappointing
what? this a 500k people city, with a metro area of about 800k. it is the capital of the second largest province of canada and of a nation. it has consulates, worldwide known hotels, famous historic landmarks, major conventional centres, a big university attracting students from all over the world. there are mosques, synagogues, baptist churches, mormons, jehovah’s witnesses. tourists and residents who come from all parts of the globe, who open restaurants, start businesses, contribute to society in all sorts of ways, form small language exchange communities. it has a historic, although scattered, vietnamese community (and others too, like jewish, irish and chinese, although these diminished greatly after the 60’s). it has recently welcomed a considerable amount of refugees from syria and bhutan (what? yeah i know). 
i live in the city, not even that much close to the center, and there’s not one day i don’t see people of african, asian or middle eastern descent. i hear english often also. although there’s no real concentration per say (no ‘ghettos’), i think this diversity is fabulous. you won’t get frowned upon if you speak english, but society here functions in french.
what the hell did they tell you about this place?
relax my friend. there are many immigrants, anglophones or others of origin, and they adapt well, make friends, etc.
people are welcoming, especially when you see that you make an effort to speak french
we have an anglo cegep (st-lawrence) 2 anglo high schools (st-patrick's & quebec high school) + some elementary schools. you can get by with english but french will unlock the full experience. ceci étant dit, tu as l'air de te débrouiller très bien en français.
...what did they tell you about quebec, again? it may not be the most blended city ever but there are tons of minorities and english speakers, especially around the uni. and not qc-based at the moment but i am a minority and i'm not a native english speaker i guess
if you're on facebook there's an 'anglophones of quebec city' group and it has several thousand members.
also a good chunk of francophones speak english in quebec city as well
little crisis to do:
once again, we have a person who speaks clearly french, who comes to live in french in quebec and almost everyone hurries to answer them in english.
little crisis over.
now that it's said, welcome to our beautiful city! 😁
il y en a des anglophones. my wife and i are one such example. mais, l'important c'est ce qu'on dit tout le temps au clients anglophones qui nous demandent choses de la ville quand ils se rendent comptent que nous sommes anglophones les deux: il faut faire au minimum l'effort de dire, "bonjour." i know saying more than that makes one feel like the can of worms of greeting colloquialisms could explode in your face and you'll have no idea what to say next, or how to respond but just say, "bonjour, um, parlez vous anglais?" if you get "yeah! sure!" which is what will happen in most cases, then great. if you get, "oh, non... desole..." that's fine too. you'll get to try your best to communicate. and even then i guarantee you that in 99% of cases, people will do their best to not make you feel weird.le probleme c'est quand on evite de s'integrer. ayant vecu en trois pays, j'ai vu dans chaque endroit comment la quantité d'integration des personnes est directement liée a leur capacité de profiter de la vie dans chaque endroit. et d'apprecier l'endroit. fermer la tete aux possibilités c'est la pire facon d'experiencier n'importe quoi dans la vie. but you have to be willing to take one on the chin every now and then and maybe have your ego hurt a bit. i'll tell you one last thing and i'm saying it in english to make sure you get it: the only times i've been insulted or made to feel bad here in this city has been from french expats living here temporarily and never from the quebecois. growing up in toronto we used to call the people from quebec "french". make no mistake, the french from france are not in any way like the quebecois. et tant mieux.
reach out if you need more help. as i said, we get a lot of anglophones in our little place on avenue cartier and they all have similar stories but they all get by ok. whether they're a family or individuals.
i'm a minority and have lived in quebec for 7 years now, whats up?
for the last few weeks / months, there have been a lot of posts about people from english canada coming to quebec-city and, based on your username, probably for the same reason as yours. so you probably won't be lost as much as any other french speakers moving in here.
yes
do not
forgot the large bosnian community in quebec, too!
prejudices die long.
you do get frowned upon if you speak english, was there this summer, can confirm. nice try tho, it's hilarious how y'all think it's so welcoming when it's nothing close if you aren't right beside frontenac.. anything out of the tourist area is brutal to english people. period.
that's good to learn !!!
paper please lol
i know, i wanted to add that just down my block, i can grab a bosnian pizza, go to a nearby mosque, bring my children play with the multicultural families that we often see in the nearby park. anyway, i could go on and on
it really often depends more on the attitude of the person in question than on their language or ethnic origin.
i've lived here for almost ten years and have been both all over the city and to remote parts of the province.  you could not be farther from the truth.
my boyfriend spoke english to a waiter. the waiter was so happy to practice his english.
win.
really?? i need to know where this bosnian pizza joint is!
i think in his case this explains it indeed
pizza binoculars, rue myrand
people are so innocent. we went to laurel / church yesterday i saw at least 3-4 grape gestures while driving. do you manage
câlisse de gang dʼépais
salvatore i would say but you get what you pay for...
pizza welat (2 for the price of 1)
normandin's pizza is godlike but pricey
franchise, i would say stratos.
best one, pizza giffard, by fucking far.
why franchise? normandin i guess but if you're willing to venture off franchise places, pierrot is the best in my opinion.
pizza passion 🍕 there s like 3 in the city.
pizza salvatore
i like their pizza too but damn it's expensive!
mike’s.
welat pizzeria 2 for 1 but if you want the best it is the one on the ormere it is even more the same recipe made there
every time i ate pizza from normandin it was still doughy, it wasn’t even cooked properly
this one is on the very high end.
love marmiton for just comfort food style pizza; or 1001 for a more euro-style pizza (the potato chip pizza is one of my favs)
pizza salvatore is winning :) i just checked their menu and it looks delicious.
thinnest pizza in town 😔
had bad service last time, they sent me an undercooked pizza, then because i cut two slices they did'nt give me a properly cooked one.
for me the best is the boulevard trailer!
also normandin with beef and sauce 1x during the year. (pizza fondue chinoise)
i often buy there. try their poutine too! quebecoise pizza and special salvadore are my favourite!
the shipping guys are pretty chill and often give you extras.
i mean op wanted cheaper pizza than normandin, about as the same price as domino's so it was either between welat & salvatore. stratos aren't cheap anymore & really good place aren't franchise.
they is tons of great pizza place in the city if one is willing to spend the dough.
will do, thanks!
only options are to rent a car or to ask for carsharing on facebook (like "destination rando québec" group)
rent a commuauto 
i would rent a car for 1-2 days and use it to do some more hiking in charlevoix the next day. unfortunately, québec city is a fairly car-centric place.
you also cant trust uber here, there's no drivers.  taxicoop is an alternative.
best to rent a car in here.
i’ll be staying in qc for the month of september. i didn’t think they had rideshare (uber,lyft) in qc. what are other modes of transpo to get around? thank you!
we have a pretty good bus system. you can get a card and pay at a gas station for points. you will be able to get around the city but wont be able to go too far out tho
the rtc also has two apps: rtc paiement for buying tickets (including daily/weekly/monthly passes), and rtc nomade for locating bus stops, routes, when the next bus will be there, etc. for actually figuring out which route to take, i use google maps and, if i’m extra finicky, double check on nomade for the real-time schedule. i don't know if the apps are supported in english, but otherwise, they're really quite useful.
note that the transit app also works in québec city and uses the same data as rtc nomade, so if you're used to that app, that should be easier for you to grasp
thank you for your response. so the apps are all in french? that might be hard for me to navigate .
yea! ok thank you very much.
is it safe to be in the bus at night? as a single women traveling alone?
i just checked : they are available in english!
edit: most bus stop names are in french though, and it seems like nomade's internal map is in french too. i think you should still be able to work it out though.
wonderful! thank you so much. i am so excited about living in qc for a month. just waiting on truedu to open the border to fully vaxxed americans. and i promise i am not a dick american. i want to immerse myself in your culture!
for the patio experience, my recommendations would be:
- la barberie; beautiful patio and one of the oldest microbrewery of quebec city. for the food, there is sometimes a caterer.
- sapristi; there is two and both have beautiful patio, they serve good french food and good cocktails
- le sacrilège; is a good bar that servers great beer (amazing patio as well)
in/near st-roch:
- tora-ya ramen has kickass ramen. 
- nina pizza does wood-fired pizzas. bit pricey, but worth it.
- chez victor has some cool burgers. and duck poutine. 
- pub du parvis has some really solid pub-type fare, and their duck eggs benedict are awesome for brunch.
- snack-wise, champagne chocolatier has good (if pricey) chocolate, and la place gourmande has a ton of local beers plus some fun local and imported food and snacks.
i like la chope gobeline for delicious food and fun theme. 
chez boulay is my favorite fine dining experience (it’s pretty affordable for lunch). 
enjoy quebec! :)
i thought sacrilêge on st jean (i think) was a cool dive bar with a nice selection.  same with l'oncle antoine down in vieux quebec.  pretty sure the former has food, but not the latter.
nina pizza is my go to place since its opened.
night
hono izakaya
barberie
222 for cocktails
for anyone reading this post in the future, for you too are travelling to quebec city and dont know where to eat, these are some plances i really enjoyed! 
i highly recommend billig for crepes, they were unreaaaalll (tried both sweet and savory, was not disappointed).  thank you for whoever mentioned this!!!
i'm surprised no one mentioned chez boulay the cafe. obvs the resto is highly praised and recommended but the cafe had some amazing sandwiches and pastries (seriously i went for breakfast and lunch). 
chez rioux et pettigrew was also very good, for a nicer dinner vibe, local fare.
can confirm le sacrilege has a great, quiet patio with a good vibe and good beer. warning: they have no food.
lastly, try duck wings (like chicken wings, but duck!) i am not sure where i had them (was quite late/dark/drinking)  but they were amazing and i saw them on more than one menu.
you could also walk down st-jean street and just choose your spot. it’s a nice street where you’ll find many bars and restaurants.
great list.  
add to that:  
la corrigane
the backyard of the festibière
the other commenter made some good suggestions. old québec is beautiful at any time of the year. however, it's about a 30 minute drive from the hotel de glace. this hotel is fairly isolated so if you're looking for something convenient, it won't be it. if you're going for the experience and don't mind renting a car, it'll be fine.
are you going to have a car ?
how long will you be staying? 
if you come at the end of january, you might be there during the carnaval, which is a huge hit
rent a fat bike at empire 47. very fun and different feeling.
somethings not many people recommend, but that are closer to the ice hotel than downtown (itself also totally worth visiting, but it is world famous and already recommended in another comment)...
- the [huron-wendat museum/hotel]( on the wendake first nation reserve
- the [trait-carré]( (website in french only, sorry, you can translate it with deepl or google translate) is an historic neighborhood almost as old as quebec city itself (1665). it features a stunning library (renovated in 2006), a few historic houses you can visit that hold many different activities and cultural associations (an art gallery, an historical society, an amazing artisanal fudge shop [[la fudgerie]( etc.), and a nice church (architecturally)
- [shannon]( : it is a village right nest to the site of the ice hotel, which was settled by irish immigrants in the xixth century. it is still the main place of residence of most english natives near quebec city and many military personnel and their families choose to live there. i don't know if there are anything interesting to visit from a tourist perspective, but their website has an *activity* section you might check, one never knows.
is it still at exit la faune? because it's at most 20 minutes, if you drive at speed limit.
we could rent one if we had too. would you recommend that?
shannon is purely peripheral suburbia, filled with low quality and low density plastic cladded bungalows on large semi-bushland. there’s no town centre and nothing to see (especially in winter).
the only ordinary thing to see and do in shannon are:
- the jacques-cartier river shannon parkland beach (summer - simply a point of access to the river but really just a locally significant panorama)
- the portneuf-jacques cartier bike trail (summer)
so really really not a destination for tourists. at best, you will drive through in 5min on the way to portneuf county (if you go that side of the river) or on the way to duchesnay.
it's all the way in valcartier. google says 30 minutes to old québec. i live near valcartier and it takes me 25 minutes to get there on a good day.
in the winter, they are a few activities outside of our downtown that could be interesting yes
i thought there could have been something about the irish that settled it. it's disappointing, but not surprising.
right! still thought it was closer.
what would you recommend?
there’s probably a plaque hidden somewhere but that would be it (there’s certainly some information board in the shannon parkland - partly about the old hydro dam). beyond its namesake, some locals and street name and a cloverleaf on the town’s logo there isn’t much focus on its irish ancestry to be honest. 
and those interested in religious heritage can stop by the church, but it isn’t a particularly significant church building in itself beyond just being locally significant. 
at this point the shannon heritage and its pride is pretty much left to a wikipedia entry, names on tombstones and entry on registers and books cause ‘je me souviens - mais c’est tout’. but that whole settlement heritage dynamic and urban structure pride is not exclusive to shannon and pretty much the whole of the jacques-cartier rcm is driven down to the ground that way (ste-catherine, st-gabriel, fossambault…). local mayors have spent decades tearing everything to get more pvc bungalows in and brick veneer car centric commercial under the argument of ‘nature awaits for you … now let’s remove it’.
the joke from my chubbier friend from ste-cath when we were kids was: ‘how else can we be, all we have is dépanneurs and a snackbar’. now they’re a suburban like with dépanneurs, a snack bar, and a tim hortons - they’ve realised their vision.
bad english but i think you'll get the point
- ice climbing on the chute montmorency (if it is open)
- dog sledding
- ice skating or cross-country skiing
- snowshoeing in the "mountains"
- going to village valcartier to slide on tubes
the last one is a combo. dont tell anyone cause its pretty nice and not many people do that (yeah i know i'll just post it on reddit but still) : outdoors spa followed by a good bière de microbrasserie. (you have plenty of choice in these two, depending on your budget. i'd recommend stromspa and noctem for the brewery)
that all sounds really cool thank you
“microbrewery” (beer is already implied by ‘brewery’)
i forgot that some parcs have "chalets" you can rent for a night or two, it is amazing for a couple ;)
check the sepaq site
you won't find those pictures. there is no borough limits signs in the city.
there's something of a bell near 5629 henri-bourassa with "charlesbourg" written on it. and i believe the water tower in sainte-foy used to have the city name on it... streetview might have an old picture? the same might go for sainte-foy's old city hall (1130 rte de l'église). i don't know if the torch actually went through ste-foy–if it did, i'm kicking myself that i missed it!–but that's where i grew up, so i know a bit more about that then the others.
also, i’d definitely recommend getting a picture of the "la capitale nationale vous salue" sign... the fact that quebec city is called a "national" capital is a perfect symbol of our cultural quirks!
these boroughs used to be cities but they fusioned with quebec city in 2000. they are old unofficial designations. no signs for them. the closest thing i can think of are the boroughs offices that might have blue signs identifying them.
i believe some of these signs exist, which boroughs are we talking about exactly ?
and to be clear, you want pictures of them on google map ?
i thought as much. if you can think of any alternatives at all, please let me know.
it did indeed travel through both laurentien and sainte-foy-sillery.
that's the other part that makes this kind of difficult...the fact that the boroughs have changed since the torch went through. the laurentien borough doesn't exist anymore.
do these offices have an 'official' name in french that i can search google maps for?
all of them. it could be on google map/streetview, or just any picture in general.
yeah... and sainte-foy and sillery were two separate cities before the fusion... i’m really hoping the rest of the route won't be as complicated!
“bureau d’arrondissement”. there might not be one for each borough.
ste-foy borough office: 1130 route de l'eglise, quebec.
la cité / limoilou borough office: 399 rue st-joseph est, quebec.
les rivières borough office: 330 rue chabot, quebec.
charlesbourg borough office: 160 76e rue est, québec.
beauport borough office: 10 rue hugues-pommier, quebec.
haute-st-charles borough office: 3490 airport road, quebec.
thank you so much! that is very helpful. that knocked out a good chunk of what i needed. now there's only two problems left.
first, i gave it a good look but there weren't actually any signs at the first one that say sainte-foy anywhere, so unfortunately that won't work. a sign that says sillery would also be acceptable.
second, and the bigger issue, is i need one for laurentien. this was a borough at the time the torch ran through, but i know it's not one anymore. not sure what i'm going to do with that one...
hum. ste-foy and sillery just don't exist anymore. they're parts of quebec city. i thought the only places where you might have potentially have had signs showing these names were these offices but if they're not there then i don't think you'll find them anywhere. as for laurentien, it just doesn't ring any bell to me. logically it would have been along highway 973/73 n which has the (un)official name of "autoroute laurentienne". might be what we now call lairet or lebourgneuf. sorry to say, you're 20 years late. ;)
if there's a sign for ste-foy inside the building, would that do? because the building is not only the bureau d'arrondissement but also the municipal court, police station and firehouse. i have a friend working there. i'll ask if there's a sign inside.
le dauphin, come for the karaoke, stay for the interesting crowd.
i live for dirty dive bars!
here's my list (i'll update it if i think of more):
petit boulevard pub
the dolphin
red lounge 2.0
pub x
jos dion
limoilou pub
the mug
le marshall (there's bowling alleys)
little prince 2.0 (lévis)
xanthie (lévis)
the globe (lévis)
le dauphin has the reputation of being one if not the trashiest bar downtown quebec. i've been there twice and can easily confirm.
the st-vallier street west (don't confuse with east which is a lot more uptown style) has some gems.
bar le duck
at girard
also, la gamelle is clearly a place to be. it's... nah just go and you'll see!
most are closed right now anyway.
the broussaille
trh bar
mower
sacrilege
bar le dauphin
night boat
shaker st-joseph
bistro-plus on st-jean, best worst place to end the evening!
the bar of the zoo!
the majority are closed now but this site was a great source of info: [
the source of the martinière in limoilou.
brushwood in vanier.
bar le lionel in loretteville.
zoo bar in orsainville.
the 447 in charlesbourg.
bar le prestige in saint-émile.
bar zotti in loretteville.
jules & jim
the 1013 of val bélair
stanley on boulevard hamel.
this is the best answer for sure.
“interesting” is certainly one way to describe it…
always a great place for street fighting.
bar le dauphin ??? probably the most trashy of the gang.
very good selection.
you will love the chamo and the pretzel in montmorency.
i'd add "la rochelène" in beauport to that list and "le quartier général" in st-sauveur.
jos dion +1
bonus; in the bar you can order yourself a pizza from the nearby restaurant!
+1 for the xanthie. charny beach.
sounds ideal!
yep. but the karaoke is fun and the regulars are pretty nice.
just for future ref mate.
with a hot dog
le chamo on avenue royale, pub le bretzel on boulevard ste-anne and pub light on la canardière are what i would classify as spectacularly shitty dive bars.
le shaker lol
the trh bar is dead. the room is for rent ....
if you want to drink with teenagers.
someone already mentioned it, i'll add it
ayoye i forgot la rochelène!
good job
le chamo à beauport to add to the list
83 represent
la canardiere in general is just the shittiest in general, so good call.
la taverne du kent near montmorency falls was also one of the grime bars in the area.
whatever the new building seems to be a lot less worse than the old one.
shady café is for me the best lebanese restaurant in quebec in my opinion. they don't have falafels though, but their kibbeh are sua coche!
just to tell you - tastes are subjective, and you don't really encourage people to help you if you leave your question with such an emphatic negative statement.
it's different but i like the lebanese galette on st-joseph, otherwise al balade not far is good too.
al balade and / or mechoui marrakech on st-joseph.
me!
i haven't tasted their falafels, but patisserie d tannous the sweet factory makes really sick shish and as long as you're there it's always good a little dessert :)
i went to 1990 rue cyrille-duquet, but they also seem to be at 3280 ch ste-fo
[
those of adonis in lebourgneuf are excellent!
it is true that it is good, but i find them so small for the price.
al balade is in my opinion the best of its kind in quebec. especially the gyros
is it a counter with stuff to heat up at home or ready-to-eat (and hot) meals?
it's a grocery store, you have both! :)
10$ on amazon.
amazon, google or microsoft. redundant supply sources arriving via lines from baie-james, manic-outardes and bersimis. hard to beat as redundancy.
i doubt it's ms, they already have their canada east center in qc. the only one of the three that is established has qc to be close to the shared service center.
with the announcement of google in beauharnois, we eliminate a second of the three players.
why not alibaba? lol
systems hosted by the cspq ...
no electrical redundancy? and once the power comes back on, how come the systems haven't returned? broken material? i have lots of questions ...
incompetent managers = deficient system
you quickly jump to judgment. sometimes in the public it's more budget reasons than skills.
why not both
i am in the public domain and when my manager, who knows nothing about my job, imposes unrealistic procedures on me that lengthen my working time and make positive results unlikely, i can only question his skills.
indeed, illico job, online placement
emploi quebec. you can search with key words in specific areas of quebec.
[emploi québec] (
have you tried posting your ads in french?
i was looking for a carpenter and i discovered facebook groups where companies post job ads and other carpenters post about their job searches. you might find something similar for hvac.
keep in mind that even with the pandemic going québec city is still near full employment. if your offer doesn’t stand up from the crowd, you will have a hard time recruiting.
we have the lowest unemployment rate of all the metro in canada with 4.1%.
is jobboom still around?
you could always reach out to the cegep and university job services, but more so the cegep. they have technical training and could like you up to some of their graduates.
didn't look at the data since the pandemic have started but there is "full employment" here in quebec city.
you might want to contact proman they might be able to help you. they got me a job last year.
it depends also on the field you are working in. there is a lot of website specialised in different work area
on the internet
check the placement services of universities and colleges that offer programs you are interested in seeing in your job applicants.
i would also suggest the spla, which is a university laval service where current and ancient students can find job in their field.
an air conditioning repair ad in english in quebec is suspicious.
yeah, and there is a job crisis at the moment. people are pretty desperate at the moment.
my french is little to non-existent but having been working on it (and obviously committed to it), willing to do literally any job to escape yyc, do you think it's possible in quebec city?
former calgarian living in qc at the moment ! unfortunately... it's rough here for an anglophone unless you possibly work in english schools or have a set of very specific job skills. montreal is easier but be prepared to work very basic jobs.
i got out by doing the odyssey program. it's a program set up through the federal government, where you go to quebec (or new brunswick) and work in a school doing activities in english with students. you don't need any teaching experience or french.
however you might be placed in a small town, you don't exactly get to choose... i was in a really small town last year, and this year i'm in quebec city.
i highly recommend you checking it out as the deadline to apply is soon (however they always take applicants after as well). the taxes are higher here but rent is so much cheaper it's wild. the salary covers everything for me very comfortably tbh. the website is englishfrench.ca
feel free to message me if you have more questions about it !
beep. boop. i'm a robot.
here's a copy of 
###[the odyssey](
was i a good bot? | [info]( | [more books](
the touristy areas are full of bilingual people. you’ll be fine. but although i love this city, i think a week might be too long. if it were me - i’d stay for 3 or 4 days and then continue on to montreal.
if you're looking for jazz i would recommend bar ste-angèle. it's really small place with live performance and good cocktails. maybe check their facebook page to see what is coming.
hope you will have a nice trip
was just there at the end of october, highly recommend, most people speak english in the places you want to go. what i loved the most is how they promote local food/produce, so many restaurants are farm to table, it’s awesome!
you’ll be fine! the french may hinder your enjoyment a bit but you’ll find enough to do to keep busy/have a good time.
you don't have to speech french, pretty much all restaurants and hotels can help you with english.
for some museum you'll need a reservation - thanks to covid19. you can buy their tickets online. don't wait untill the last minute to buy them, else you will not be able to visit. there's not a lot of them.
have a nice stay :).
my best experiences while traveling were when i was alone. ymmv.
come visit us at the aquarium!
 if you come on weekdays it's pretty empty and you'll have the site almost to yourself ! it's a nice place to visit on your own and we have a brand new  space for the polar bears! 
if you want to learn about our animals, all of our education staff is bilingual and very friendly :)
you can make a reservation online at  
  just bring a warm coat because there are animals outside as well
quebec city has some awesome microbreweries too: la barberie and la souche to name only a few.
want to do a photoshoot in old québec? 
i want to get back to tourist photo and therefore a cool practice for next tourist season. let me know
i booked my three nights for dec 7-10. i'll be staying at a small hotel near parc des gouverneurs because the price was reasonable and it included on premises parking. if anyone has any other suggestions for a hotel please let me know - i can always cancel. i'm going to do get a package at strom nordic spa and look to reserve a spot at a museum and the aquarium. open to any restraurant suggestions. if anyone is down for a friendly drink or meal on those days let me know. someone on another thread suggested tinder even if it's just to hang out with people so i may give that a shot too. thanks for all your suggestions!
thanks. that could work, i have a friend who just moved to montreal and had a kid that i would love to visit for a day or two.
oh and you'll need to show a proof that your are double vaccinated about everywhere you go - restaurant, café, bar. make sure you have it.
thanks for the tip!
can i ask what kind of things you do? do you still enjoy eating out and bars while alone? any suggetions or tips?
wait! the aquarium house polar bears?
now we're talking! thanks!
don’t get me wrong - quebec city is awesome! lots of history and good museums. but it is not that big. montreal is only a few hours away. 
in quebec city i really like the musée de la civilization, the ursuline museum, the outdoor market, the basilica and hanging out by chateau frontenac. i always stay at the youth hostel hi - quebec when i go. it’s cheap and downtown and in the middle of everything. but even if staying in a hostel is not for you - contact them anyway. they run some nice walking tours. 
have fun!
not that it changes anything, but it's in europe that i travelled alone. i have a family with kids now, so i don't travel or do many activities alone anymore. not that i wouldn't like it, i just don't have the time for that.
eating out, visiting museums, attending a city tour. you can enjoy all of those alone. i personally don't like bars much, alone or with others, but if you do enjoy them, there's no reason you wouldn't if you went alone. i did meet many people while traveling, did some things with them before parting ways and then finding others. the best place for that is a youth hostel. usually while preparing your evening meal or eating breakfast, you can chat with the other people, ask what they plan to see/do while they're here, or what they did see or do and enjoyed, and then you may decide to tag along for the day or part of it.
yes they do! and they have a brand new habitat that's really beautiful and worth to see
here, i found [the message] ( in question
these platforms are so blurry and are just abstract ideals. it's frustrating. i want a budget, i want to see plans for economic recovery, on the route, composting, etc. how much do their ideas cost?
i don't like this campaign. only emptiness.
[deleted]
i tried, it's not too written, i went around and it's really complicated to find
it feels weird to read a post and feel targeted!
yeah, actually i just navigate through this sub to find a topic that i already visited concerning the elections.
hahaha i preferred to point to your post and give you the credit than just copy / paste :)
not enough
none, pcq i sleep at night
... but i sleep 8h / night
6-7
7-8h
i don't know who needs to hear this, but not getting enough sleep is not a flex.
either i go to bed at 10 a.m. or at 2 a.m. no in-between. but i always get up around 7 a.m. so between 5 and 9 hours.
5/6h
between 2 and 5 hours.
it depends.
but sometimes i compensate, like on a friday i can go to bed straight away by finishing the job and wake up the next evening / night.
since i have kids it's tough to stay awake past 9 p.m. sometimes 8 p.m.
worse it makes me get up between 4h and 6h worse i start working directly. fec mid pm i finished my day.
6hrs or more
7-8 but i train a lot and honestly think i would need 9-10
2 to 4 hours per night and never all at once .. damn insomnia.
10 hours, i don't want to do psycho-pop, but are you okay? it's a warning sign of depression, having trouble getting up, always wanting to sleep.
i would say 2-3 hours, sometimes 4. except at night, of course.
before i take the medication i have been on for almost 10 months: 8-10h
i am at 6-8 a.m. because sleep disorders are one of the side effects that i have
6 to 8 a.m. approximately
6-6.5
4-5h daily, pi once a month i sleep a 12h to replace myself lol
8h
i'm glad i know my sleep cycle well. 8am i'm in top shape the next day. 7am not too much energy the next day. at the bottom of 7am, my productivity takes the edge the next day. worse 10h steady when i'm on vacation.
at least 9 hours, usually 10 hours. when i was young \ * cough \ *, i slept 6 hours max per night.
i sleep more or less 7 hours a night. i wake up at 5 a.m. to train and try not to fall asleep later than 1
22h. the only problem when you get up early is that on weekends you wake up automatically ... i envy you people who are able to resume their sleep on saturday morning!
7 interspersed with baby awakenings
sleep is so important. prioritize it!
the workholics and the ancap.
same
i'm jealous.
ahahah. yep depression and hypertension.
my god i don't know how you survive.
in my circle of friends they find me ridiculous. but i calm down quite a bit to be honest.
i know it's a damn bad habit, but like, i've been doing this since i was 14 ish worse it feels like when i sleep too much i'm more tired during the day, when i sleep less i'm more focused .
and i'm even more focused at night, that's where if i had something to do during the evening i would go for it.
i often code at night, i don't know why
i recognized that pcq that i lived for years like that. what really helped me is the sport, i cycle a lot. it changed my life for the better, i want you to go there.
20% of people are made to work nights, 20% only during the day and 60% are adaptable. while coding, i was a lot more efficient at night too, less distraction, more in the flow.
different genetics.
yeah, i went to the gym 4 times a week, jogged 3 to 4 times a week. i lost 40 lbs of muscle and gained 50 lbs of fat in 18 months, feel very bad. i don't even recognize myself in the mirror. but since the covid and my change of job i have entered a vicious cycle. for a week my supper has been just watermelon and doritos. lol
what is contradictory however is that i love to sleep, i could spend whole days sleeping. but when the time comes to go, i guess there are more useful things to do right now. well the screens don't help i know that.
yeah, personally i read before going to bed, no screen at least an hour before.
i tried to read before bed but it falls asleep -wait / s
it's a good habit, i want to get started. but rather manga.
hahaha
a kobo does wonders;)
1. the wind can be cold, and without sun it's becoming cold quickly!
2. for the construction: this year is really horrible because many roads were long due, but also because of the pandemic, the government put so much more money to stimulate the economy and make people work. that's why there is so much right now.
be happy that you were not here in the end of june/ mid august because they closed 4 lines on 6 on the pont/bridge pierre laporte. lol.
1. generally tourists
2. don't go to montreal, it's way worse!
glad you enjoyed it! 
1. i don't think i've seen anyone with proper winter coats, only warm-looking fall costs. also, people tend to dress warmer in the fall than the spring, because our bodies aren't used to the cold weather. 
2. i wish i knew too... i live on a main road, on a major bus route, and they closed the same section of my street twice this summer! why they couldn't do everything in one go, i really have no clue. on the other hand, winter really cuts the construction season short, so it tends to all happen at once. and depending on how fast the roads are plowed, you may well lose a lane in the winter too!
the photo doesn't have to do it justice. they look like the corridors of laval university in the 90s!
rue maguire is pretty close and has 2 great options: pizza 900 and pizza mag!
it's been a while, but jumelles pizza used to be my goto place for pizza when i was a student
what kinda pizza ?  
greasy, junky (in a good way) comfort pizza ? i'd say jumelles on myrand.
more gastronomic options ? no 900 (maguire) or la boîte à pain on chemin sainte-foy (bonus, there is a beiko beignes next to it).
jaja la pizz if it's still open. just around de l'église.
my favorite was pizz'art in les halles de ste-foy, but it closed a few days ago :(
next favorite is la boîte à pain
if you want gastronomic, you can't go wrong with chic alors
pizza is allowed
pizza in quebec is absolutely horrific if you've had pizza anywhere else in the world.
pizza mag for the win. my fav pizza in that area.
no 900 is excellent. their burrata too, by the way!
\ +1 the bread box
\ +1 beiko
we're exploring options.  and thanks for beiko. she loves that place, and maybe i'll go and get a doughnut for her as well.
not bad sure that the only jaja still open in town is him from concorde, unfortunately.
well, it's close there. hmm, maybe le cosmos i would say.
it's very good, but it's a bit farther away.
i wouldn't say horrific.  there are some gems, but pizza here certainly isn't as plentiful as it was in other places i have lived.
halifax was incredible for selection and price. a 16", 3 topping for under $20 delivered. and that was from a local joint.
i live near a pizzeria paquette, and while it is great pizza, it's really expensive. when we moved in, we got 2 larges and a medium, and it was like $90.
i have eaten pizza in new york, montreal, milan, and naples. there are very good pizzas in quebec. just dig a bit.
at the bread box the one with seafood is really good!
nah. they don't do pizzas anymore.
yeah but it's probably possible to deliver to chul.
it's right next to quebec city but the sangria of cassis mona and girls on île d'orléans is just disgusting.
quai 1635 have a very good one. backyard of the festibiere too.
-take the ferry and go to levis. you have the best view of the city from the the other border of the river.
-one good spot to see the city is l’observatoire de la capitale but i don’t know if it’s open at this moment.
-the restaurant at the top of the concorde (turning restaurant) can be interesting for breakfast and/or lunch.
-you need to see the montmorency falls
-la cour arrière du festibiere is a cool spot to go. it’s a place to have a beer seated with your feet in the water. (familly friendly)
-if you love history visit ‘’la citadelle’’
-if you have a rainy day le musée national des beaux-arts du quebec is a good place to go.
two days i would say would be a minimum. i really liked the ursuline convent tour and musee de civilization. also the farmers market near the train station is really special. its a two level city. part of the city is on top and the second part is on the river. consider a walking tour. it is a small city but there is a lot there. it looks very much like a european city.
hello! i’d spend at least 2 days. visiting old québec will take an entire day if you’re a good walker. then try promenade samuel de champlain, l’île d’orléans or a bike ride at rivière st-charles
thanks. that's helpful.
would you recommend staying in inside the city or just outside of it is fine as well?
2 days is quick for sure, but you could basically walk up and down the old city and leave fairly satisfied. more specifically :
* the battlefield museum on the plains of abraham (where it all happened)
* the citadel (also at the top of the hill near the plains)
* place royale (down the hill, lots of nice shops/restaurants)
* the musée de l'amérique francophone. you get to visit the old catholic seminary, it's pretty cool i think.
* île d'orléans / montmorency falls.
staying in old québec is nice, however there are no real grocery stores if you're staying in an airbnb, parking can be an issue and the restaurants are pricier/less authentic. if you're staying outside the old city, i don't think there are any dangerous areas, but you might need to practice your french more. the following neighborhoods are within walking distance of the old city :
* saint-roch (down the hill. edgy/cool/seedy depending on your personnality). rue saint-joseph has good food/drinking options.
* saint-jean-baptiste (up the hill. nice/bougie/artsy). you won't have to walk down the hill at the end of the day.
* montcalm (a little further away. super nice). look around rue cartier.
* consider also staying in lévis close to the ferry. quieter for sure, but very scenic and possibly cheaper. do check the ferry schedule as it's limited this summer, so you might have to leave your accommodation for the whole day and making it back at night. however be prepared to practice your french if staying in lévis :)
you can basically walk the entirety of the old city in a day, but you'd need more time to visit any of the particular attractions.
taking the ferry to lévis to walk up the hill to the original chocolats favoris for ice cream is a great way to snap some pictures and go a little outside of the touristy spots.
if you're looking for a true hidden gem, look at [la fromagerie du presbytère]( near victoriaville.  you should stop a nice cheese board and hang out in the shade before hitting the road again.
at least 2-3 days. 
i recommend you learn how to ask in french if people speak english. english is not as widely spoken here than in montréal. almost everyone speaks it to a very basic level. the younger they are, the better the english. 
it's seen as very polite and respectful to introduce yourself with just a generic french greeting before switching to english. it can be disconcerting when you rarely use english to have someone come up to you and bombard you with words in another language before you can "flip the language switch". 
"excuse me, do you speak english?" put it in google translate and have it say it out loud.
if you're not comfortable with that it's perfectly fine, you can just ask in english "sorry, do you speak english?" it's still very polite. in montreal though, people will swap between languages 3x mid sentence so it's not an issue.
as for places to go, i won't state the obvious ones you already know about, here's a few less traditional and known options, for after you're down with all the old town stuff
if you're driving i recommend you also look for nice spots outside of the touristic old town area. do the lower city (literally lower, big architecture clash between on top of the hill and at the bottom of it). we have neat waterfalls (chutes montmorency, chutes de la chaudière, chutes kabir kouba. the first nations reserve wendake (inside quebec city) has hidden gems are very tourist friendly. the island île d'orléans is on the saint-laurent in front of québec city too and has interesting stuff to do, more nature oriented. for outdoors activities, the duschenay national park has a lot of options for really cheap, free guides. if you're willing to drive a bit over an hour and like beautiful landscapes (with a great view), hit the charlesvoix region.
there's a waterpark with a lot of activities available called villages vacances valcartier.
we have a plethora of beautiful parks and hiking spots.
we have the best damn microbreweries and cheese makers. many pubs in the old town will offer their beers. ask around. if you just want to buy a couple bottles to bring home, hit "monde des bières", they'll tell you what's good and they have a ridiculously large selection.
and do yourself a favour, find yourself a real poutine while you're in québec. there's lists online for the best spots. it's a hot debate so i won't suggest any haha.
oh and the best view of québec city is not in québec city, it's across the river in lévis. take the ferry, it's the cost of a bus ride. there's a beautiful docking area on both sides you can chill in. lévis also has beautiful traditional architecture and isn't as crowded.
it's currently the summer festival in québec.. but covid version, so a much much smaller scale. still, look for feq (festival d'été de québec) there's many things going on downtown around the festival.
enjoy your stay. hit me in dm if you're having any problems and i'll help you out.
if you like nature, the parc de la jacques-cartier is a 45 minutes car ride from the city and is a beautiful place. but it might be a stretch for a 2-3 days trip since the visit will take you at least half a day and easily a whole day if you want to walk some trails or do some activities. visiting the « abris sous roches » is usually a win with the kids (and the parents too!).
>\-you need to see the montmorency falls
i cannot stress this enough. it's my favorite place to go even if i live in the city.
>	-the restaurant at the top of the concorde (turning restaurant) can be interesting for breakfast and/or lunch.
ciel bistro bar. brunch is great there but i also recommend diner.
the farmers market has moved just besides vidéotron center. it’s a 5-10 minute drive from the train station
you will enjoy it a lot more if you are near the old quebec. if you find a place on the plateau, it will be a lot simpler to visit without your car. being outside will require you to park, although you can easily park for cheap or free if you dont mind walking.
you don't need to stay in the old quebec if you're driving, just don't stay too far in order to not lost too much time on traffic due to several works in progress on the streets during this summer (or every other summer).
being from toronto, you will find the parking here is way less expencive. the main option are in the lower city "spaq place des canotiers" in front of the musée de la cinilisation. it's a multi-level parking lot with a great view of the chateau frontenac. from there you can visit the museum and them walk to the place royale and from there to quartier petit champlain.
from the lower city you can take the "funiculaire du vieux-québec" to climb to the upper city (you will get out in front of the chateau de frontenac), or use the "escalier casse-cou (breakneck steps)", witch i only recommend if you're going from upper to lower city and not the opsit. on the upper city the main parking lot will be the one under the "hôtel de ville de québec (city hall of quebec city)". the city hall itself is quite an atraction and from there you can visit the "la basilique-cathédrale notre-dame de québec", the "le musée du fort" and all the upper city.
either going up from the lower city, after visit the upper side or going direct to it, you should definetly visit the chateau de frontenac (there are guided tours if you want go inside) and walk trhough the "terrasse dufferin". if you decide to start the day from there, you can have a brunch in one of the restaurants of the chateau.
there is also the parking lot "stationnement spaq - youville". the "place d'youville" is a great place to visit the walls, wich you can walk over to the other side in front of the "hôtel du parlement du québec" and close to the park "pleines d'abraham" and the "la citadelle de québec". on the other side of the fortress is the "la terrasse saint-denis", another great point of view over the city, i recommend going there by car but it may be hard to find parking spaces.
a good place to have a panoramic view of the city is the restaurant le ciel, you can have a brunch there.
if its rainning, you can take the kids to the "méga parc" in the "les galeries de la capitale" mall.
if you plan to park on the streets sides, install the app copilote. you can use it to pay and renew the parking.
it depends, if you want to eat at night in the old city, best to stay not too far from foot. otherwise, there's plenty of cheaper hotels on laurier blvd. don't go on hamel blvd hotels though.
in levis, can the suspended bridge be traveled on foot or need a car?
and it's incredible any time of year, for different reasons!
thank you - i haven’t been since 2019.
québec also allows parking on most streetsides. downtown usually has paid meters for it, otherwise it's free. paid spots are free after 21:00.
 it was a bit of a shock for me when i lived in ontario to realize even in small towns like kitchener, you couldn't park anywhere on the streets for free. you're lucky if you can find a 2h max spot. 
those paid parking lots you named are in great spots that make things simpler for tourists though.
and from the hotels on laurier, it’s a quick ride (about 15 minutes)by bus (800 and 801) to go in the old town. just in case you don’t want to drive your car in the old town and find a parking.
you can cross the cantilever bridge on foot/bike but not the suspended one. also, the suspended one is only connected to highways whereas the cantilever one loads to standard roads.
that's helpful, thanks!
will be reaching quebec city in next 3 hrs.
enjoy your trip. sorry in advance for the bad weather we're having
wish that would be controllable..all good.
i live in lévis. pm me
what is the game, out of curiosity?
if it weren't for the bridges, i would be down, but i won't pull myself away sorry
i can give you a hand. pm me.
a little too far for me but glad to see people offering their help already. it's good to be of service. well done.
pm me. i'm from montreal.
i'll see what i can do :-)
artistically interesting, it will be difficult, on st-jean it's mostly tourist credits.
most of the fun little shops in town sell merch, for example the record store "le knock out" or one of the many microbreweries (griendel's merch is really nice).
tourist tips: rue saint jean inside the doors. there are credits but there are also original things in funny shops.
google the store inventory. it's curiosities, if there's any merch in town, he should be curious. plus: it's opposite the knock out that was mentioned here.
further on, exo has beautiful designs identified locally (qc, st-roch, etc.).
in short, if you want generic tourism it's saint jean, for more streetwear stuff it's the local shops and more often it will be the name of the neighborhood (saint-roch, limoilou, saint-sauveur) more than quebec.
dollarama !
poutine is like tourtière or spag sauce. the best is the one you grew up with / the one you associate the most fondly with.
[deleted]
ashton is not that bad, calm your nerves or i'll start ban. / s
of course there are the best, especially for the price. but after a big brush, at one o'clock in the morning, an ashton poutine it comes back to the station in sickness.
the pierrot in limoilou! : p
i don't like it, i was not born in quebec, but there was an ashton where i grew up (st-georges de beauce)
i would have liked a choice "at 3 o'clock in the morning it does the job."
the first time i tried a poutine at ashton's, i thought it's not good at all ... but after a while, i try it again, and it's not that bad this time lol. i would tell you it's tolerable now ...
where is the option "only when i'm on a big day after sleep"?
defined * born in quebec * ... i was born in montreal, never lived there, i arrived in quebec at the age of 1½ years ...
it's not the best in my opinion, but it is very good value for money. i find that poutineville (735 rue saint-joseph e) does the best (the fermier or poutineville versions are at the top).
(i was not born in quebec but i live there)
/ u / redalastor you forgot the option "never tried"
ashton is big shit
the best tourtière is the one from saguenay because otherwise it's not tourtière, it's meat pie.
i will die defending this position and i will be as bad faith as possible in doing so.
it's not because there are better seats that ashton isn't good, ya know?
gaston is the best, no doubt, go go sylvie!
the best is in a food truck in wendake. nomadic saga.
i'm new to quebec: i'm going to try it!
he moved to lairet (≈1km) 2 weeks ago, after 50 years in the same place!
i like it as long as i'm too gorlot to remember it, it's not particularly a mark of love.
is the ashton part of your childhood memories?
no, it is that of lac-saint-jean. prepared with a minimum of 1/2 of moose meat cured for 12 hours.
: p. i was talking more about variations on the theme. obviously, if it's not a minimum of 5 "thick, it's not tourtière.
exactly my point 😂 every time i eat one i remember better and better.
bah ... i guess so. we didn't often eat poutine, and my mother made it home (she made her own fries, without a fryer), which left a better memory.
yeah i meant saguenay-lac-saint-jean. scusez i usually just say saguenay haha (it's shorter and anyway i'm not from the lake, so i'm just not used to saying saguenay-lac-saint-jean in full)
i made my first tourtière in my life last christmas since my matantes weren't there to worry about it. i was quite stressed haha but she was good!
i introduced my boyfriend to chez georges' spag sauce and he dared to say (but not too loudly) that it was better than his mother's.
chicout's condescending czech, who ignores the existence of poor jeannois!
/s
> that she was better than her mother's.
the ultimate compliment in the kitchen! i had the immense privilege of receiving this compliment from a friend and i wear it as a badge of honor!
at least i'm not from chicoutimi-sud. they are really snobs there.
chez georges décalice spag sauce all in its path, including the supposedly indestructible love you have for maternal cooking.
worse, chez georges spag sauce won't even answer your texts when you try to reach her the next day. it's crisp dry fret as well.
i'm not necessarily opposed to a 3rd link, but in this form it's ridiculous. i find it absurd that the caq wanted to keep the budget for the tramway to the absolute minimum, meanwhile they were preparing a 3x more expensive project that serves fewer users and only extends quebec's already vast motorway system. i don't even really see the gains for the people of lévis when the tunnel access is so far south. and for the people of quebec, sorry, but what use is it for me to take a bus that drops me off next to the hotel l'oiselière? there's absolutely nothing there, it's a tunnel to farmland!
the next logical step is to merge lévis with quebec.
and since it is a tunnel towards agricultural land, it leaves room for urban sprawl on the south shore ... which will increase car traffic.
"we are going to come and create wealth" they say!
i don't know lévis, but given that one of the objectives is to connect the tunnel to the 20, where would be better placed?
the wealth of real estate speculators from levis.
it's time to buy patches of land on the south shore, but we're not developing them to turn the world upside down!
yes! these damned outlaws. keep them on a leash! / s
i do not see the problem by respecting the 2 meters and with the mask. anyway. me, i'm at home like a hermit, living my best life so far
i went by bike to a park in montreal and there were so many people talking to each other without masks and less than two meters away and the worst part was that their conversation topics were deadly.
if the fonts aren't there, it's because they don't want to see. it's full there every fine day since april.
what do you mean no police? it's practically the backyard of the police station!
i passed by there on saturday. there weren't really many people who respected the 2m and i don't think i saw a single mask. without the slightest exaggeration, one would have thought that saint-jean was on the plains.
too busy distributing inspections for "modified" vehicles.
i can't say, i trust people's good faith in all of this. as i tell you, i have been at home with the curtains closed since last march, i am well and i respect the sanitary measures like no one in spite of myself;)
edit: march 2020 we get along
i work nearby. since the start of the good weather, this park has gathered a lot of people. often, these are young people who are sitting together, without a mask. there was probably a bigger crowd on saturday, but every weekday evening there are dozens of people if not more.
the people vote by their actions. if the common people have come to gather in parks, it is up to the government to relax the rules so as not to criminalize normal behavior accepted by the community.
separatist simon says... 
i passed by there on saturday. there weren't really many people who respected the 2m and i don't think i saw a single mask. without the slightest exaggeration, one would have thought that saint-jean was on the plains.
here is a copy of a comment i made on another thread, as you know most everything is closed right now but hey, it won't be forever! it's the general tourist version of a city guide, if i knew more about you i could be more precise, for example there are many micro-breweries that are worth a visit, or stuff for kids, or hiking spots, etc.
so for a start, the chateau frontenac on terasse dufferin is the most photographed hotel in the world its quite impressive to see, from there go down to quartier petit champlain, when the snow is falling it's truly magical. from down there you can take the ferry to lévis, where you will have the best view of québec city, they also have a nice old town and a history of their own. back in québec, the citadelle is a multiple century old military fort, there is a museum in there you can visit. the plains of abraham is a important site in the history of canada, where a big (but quick) battle was fought between the english and the french. the parliament is near that, you can also visit it, the architecture is beautiful. for night life visit the grande-allée, that's where the cool bars are and also the rotating restaurant on top of the concorde hotel. for another good view, look for the city's observatory, its on top of the tallest building. not too far is the modern art museum witch is built into an old prison its quite interesting. if you are into spooky stuff, there are ghost tours of the city as well, google it. the rue st-jean is one of the most popular street, its a quaint shopping district. when you see the hotel-dieu, the oldest hospital in north america (there's a museum) you can go down to the lower city where you will find rue st-joseph. the lower city is way less tourist-y, there's a good selection of boutiques and not too pricey restaurants. to the west of the core city area, the aquarium is pretty cool, there is a nice park outside with a beautiful view of the bridges and the river. to the east is the ile d'orléans, take the ring road, its a country experience right next to the city. it's also right by the montmorency falls which are also quite impressive, there is a park there and a kind of ski lift with an amazing view. if the remparts (the city's junior hockey team) are playing at the videotron center, take a look! the arena is still brand new and nhl ready, the ambiance is always electrifying. there is a shoping center called les galleries de la capitale a little outside the city, with an indoor amusement park, ice skating area and fancy food market, its quite impressive. if you're willing to go a bit out of the city (20min by car), check out the village vacance valcartier, its a huge winter amusement park with massive slides and indoor water-park, tons of fun! oh! n'oubliez pas d'essayer la poutine! chez gaston on rue dorchester will give you the best potato shack poutine experience and its open very late, la poutinerie on rue saint-joseph is fancyer and more of a restaurant experience, they have more variety (but pretty much anywhere you go you will find poutine!)
i would say avoid eating and shopping in the old city, it's very good, but also super touristy and you will pay the price. other than that anything in the tourism guide (www.quebec-cite.com/en/) is worthwhile i would say, it depends on what you enjoy personally. one last thing, people here can easily switch to english, especially in the old quebec and other tourist spots, but we all appreciate someone making the effort to start with what little french they know, even if its only "bonjour!" and "merci!". as an isolated island of french culture in north america, we are quite proud of our roots!
wow thank you, i honestly didn't realize how much to do there is!
i identified a couple of good spots with a good view for sightseeing the city and taking photos of the chateau frontenac. i usualy take vistors to both :
\-  la terrasse saint-denis, it's just besides the citadelle and you will be able to see the chateau and the lower city from a diferent angle. there's a stairway you can take to get to dufferin terrace from there.
\- stationnement spaq - dalhousie, it's in front of the musée de la civilisation. you take the elevator to the top level of the parking lot and go to the other side, from there you can take amazing pictures of the chateau.
also, there is an anglos in quebec facebook group that is very helpful.
may i ask where exactly you are moving? maybe we can also recommend some stuff for the particular place you are moving to (or farther away in that direction, which could have been too far from downtown, but not so much from where you'll be living).
>the grande-allée, that's where the cool bars are
your comment was super good, there's just that which could be so true. i'm not saying you're completely wrong, but i find cartier, st-jean and st-joseph to be the best places to go out.
the name of that group is *anglophones living in quebec city*, unless you are thinking of another one that i don't know about.
in shannon!
true! my info is starting to date haha!
it is also so true that it pcq everything is closed astheure.
then you're very close to the valcartier river and the activity center of the same name (water activities in the summer [and in a heated dome in the winter], and sliding activities in the winter). there is an historical irish community living in shannon, with a traditional irish dance school and some other related activities. you could check voice of english speaking quebec (veq)'s [website]( for quebec's english speaking community and activities all year round .
wait, are we once again decrying an inconsistent decision by the caq?
yes.
i have my trip!
thanks for the news. it's truly sad. if i were the artist i would paint tire tracks on the vandalized works to mock the idiots who did that!
quebec is beautiful for tourists in summer, but it is exceptionally magical for locals in winter…. i love my quebec city!
it makes great bravo! what editing software do you use?
premier pro, and youtube university
it is such a beautiful place! it would be a shame if they did not keep a natural part, even more children and young people who will go to school. the land is big, i can't believe they couldn't put together a project that would keep a bit of the old zoo.
i also really hope that there is a solution to use at least the indo-australian greenhouse for an educational side ... to have been there recently, the building is still superb ...
seems like it's a funny timing to invest in shopping centers.
galeries charlesbourg still has the look of the 70s ... it won't hurt
the pandemic will end one day.
hi, it seems like a funny timing to invest in malls., i'm dad.
bad bot?
bad bot, very bad bot!
if you like the outdoors i would spend a day at the parc national de la jacques-cartier. you can rent snowshoes and i would suggest the trail called « les loups ». walking in quebec city is quite nice during the holidays. walking the plaine d'abraham is a must. there is a nice spa below the plains, the storm spa, with a view on the fleuve st-laurent. 
there is also a few christmas markets. walk by the chateau frontenac. walk on la rue saint-jean. you can also go see the « chutes montmorency » if you like waterfalls, it's about a 15-20 min car ride. 
the restaurant called l'albacore is also quite nice if you like seafood. enjoy.
the old city is done up for the holidays so just walking around could be really interesting. otherwise, i don't know of any specific activities happening, but there is definitely all the usual stuff like the museums, tours, and attractions.
the old city is beautiful, especially at this time of year. i always recommend la bûche! traditional québécois food, decorated warmly like a log cabin :)
hey, i'm also doing a solo trip but in early december. i'll be sure to let you know if i find anything. what i do have planned so far is a spa visit at strom nordic spa and a bunch of restaurants i want to go to.
new year eve is starting to get quite an event, besides covid of course.
electricity spa
the second la buche. great place!
> the log
thanks! i'll wait for your suggestions. take care and safe travels!
i sold insurance over the phone for desjardins financial security. i felt no desire on their part to meet the customers' need. the first product i had to sell was rotten. so much so that the strategy was to insist until the customer said yes. in fact, we had to stop at the 3rd refusal, and say "excuse me, i misunderstood you."
this means that on the 1st and 2nd refusal, you had to continue as if nothing had happened.
i felt like a blinds salesman. it helped a bit but i quit opc.
what do you mean that there would be more people?
desjardins is still more or less 50,000 employees.
i can tell you that i did not join the company after several interviews and a rather disappointing offer from them ...
i had expressed my expectations before the process, they came below.
this is typical of the it banking industry. they want it all but are not ready to pay.
which sector?
was that the kind of disability insurance on the checking account? i spent 30min saying no on the phone ... 3 months later she show up in my transactions
i was in the same building as you doing inbound selling travel insurance lol. it was a great job and a great experience, however.
yes, but example of similar companies with a head office in paris is hundreds of thousands of employees ...
and finally did you find a job at the competition? genre ia
all ? or in it example
it was the equivalent but for credit card balances. it's called credit balance insurance if i remember correctly
dude ... france is 8x the population of quebec .. surprise, 50,000 \ * 8 is 400,000 ...
yes, but paris has 2x more public holidays and 2 more weeks of vacation. to go with the productivity that papa legault dreams of, here we are bcp more productive than in france
no, i returned for a consultation, no charge!
i am with an it competitor and i can guarantee you that the balance is on the edge of desjardins, i have only one colleague who comes from desjardins but i lost a good dozen for desjardins in the last year. people don't just go for 5-10k.
in my opinion, people are moving because salaries are rising sharply everywhere, but in it it's even worse. in addition, the big american companies come to look for us for staff, especially since the pandemic and the remoting, for them, we are the mexico of the north, it costs them nothing to hire devops at 150k-200k, the companies here do not arrive. to accomodate that.
for the other sectors, i have a friend who tried to follow the training to be an agent and it was really too difficult from her point of view, probably that there are a lot of called, not a lot of elected.
the calculation is a little too fast. they have employees in several provinces. but hey there is the idea i admit.
more productive than in france? i would like to see that ...
easy get out of your house and cross some 3-4 street corners
i think it’s perfect for a first time. get the àvelo bikes. it’s electric too promenade champlain is flat but everything else is uphills both ways
if you are going to l'ile d'orléans, mona et filles is also a great place to buy nice bottles. when near sainte-anne, you could also check beaupré's microbrewery.
i'd have recomanded to go to the jacques cartier park for the colors but i went last weekend and it was already decaying.
i was just at morency falls yesterday. the amenities, the zip line, and the gondola were closed, i think for the season. you can still walk around the park behind it and you can walk across the bridge/down the stairs along the side of the falls though. the leaves in the area were gorgeous too.
day 1 : it's missing some place royale (petit champlain neighbourhood) and the musée de la civilisation.
skip saint-anne-de-beaupré and spend all your time on l’ile d’orleans. there is nothing interesting in saint-anne except if you’re religious and want to see the basilique
there are so many things on the island. cassis mona et filles, cheese factory. several winnery, steinbach (good cider), cheese factory, several « casse-croutte », la maison smith for a good coffee, etc.
i would agree that it is a pretty good plan. remember that the city itself is on a plateau, so there is an "uppertown" and a "downtown" (sorry for the bad translation) but the bike rides are usually a good way to visit around the city.
day 1: walking inside the walls is a great way to get the vibe of the city. there is a ferry from quebec to levis, across the st.lawrence river. during the evening, it is the best view of the entire city, and a two-way tickey without a car is so cheap. there are a lot of great options inside and outside the walls.
day 2: i love le billig, but do not know if they offer brunch everyday of the week. if you are driving to montmorency falls, remember that we are in our foliage season and it will still be beautiful. just driving will be nice.
day 3: you might see the old quebec funicular, montmorency park, old port on day 1. if it is windy, i would recommend biking along the st.charles river instead. i love the tour at the chateau and the morrin center. if you like museums, there are also great options.
day 4: the bridge to the ile d'orleans (st.pétronille) is near the montmorency falls.  as for food places, you seem to prefer french cuisine which is pretty good. there is a great vibe around boreal cuisine (bistro chez boulay for example) where they substitute everything with local ingredients. it does depend on your budget. there are a lot of nice restaurants, we are pretty lucky.
have a great trip, keep us informed on how it went.
since downtown has a different meaning in english, i recommend we standardize to "upper city" and "lower city" when we refer to haute ville and basse ville. it'll avoid confusion
hey, thank you;)
i got mine here! 
i just did this trip last week...
you need a pcr test to get into canada. the canadian website is not very clear on this. must be within 72 hours. when you get to the border you may be randomly selected for a pcr test anyway (super annoying, why did i pay $100 in america if you're going to test me anyway...)
the us doesn't care at all. border patrol coming back in took under 20 seconds.
you should try this place:
elna quebec
1398 chemin ste foy quebec, g1s2n6
that's where all my colleagues and i get tested. super quick and easy, but you need an appointment.
merci bcp. this part i have down, but i’m wondering more about getting back into the us. they will require an antigen test, so i’m just wondering about where is the best place to book that in qc. 😁
thank you. unfortunately they’re closed monday for the holiday (i called). 😔
thanks so much!!  and is the arrivecan app fairly straightforward?  do i just fill all the info in?  how does that work?  i can’t imagine the border patrol checks the app when you’re arriving?  or is there something more to it?
sorry if this is an obvious question, but with respect to how long it takes for results to come, how many days do u think u should get the test before arriving to canada? im visiting sometime in the winter, but not sure when to get it as they say within 72 hours of arrival date (but waiting time to get the results have taken very long…)
do they require that now? last month my girlfriend who visited me from the us went back without having to provide anything. did they change that?
yes, fill in everything on arrivecan, it's actually really helpful. and yeah the last thing you fill in on the app is an estimate of when you're arriving at the border (eg 3 pm 10/12), so as soon as i gave the patrol officer my passport, he was able to see all my arrivecan information, so they do look it up. 
arrivecan + proof of negative test + passport should be everything you need and you're good to go!
you need to get a rapid test. i got my test thursday at 8:00 am and by the time i crossed the border at 3:00 pm later that day i already had my results. 
there's really not a way around that unfortunately. if you travel by plane, i believe the airport/airline will figure out the testing for you (but you still may have to pay). 
until canada changes their rules, that's how land borders work though. 72 hours before you cross you need a negative test result that you can show them.
get a walgreens id now test (naat) results within 24 hours, usually much faster (i've had under an hour) since it's processed at the pharmacy.
hmmmm. i am not certain to be honest. i need to confirm
you may have made my day. it seems i’ve been looking at air travel requirements!
thanks so much, 🐄 🐄 🐄!!
ah that makes sense. glad to be of help! enjoy your stay in québec :)
you can't do this kind of thread without telling us your arguments.
the election period has started? i didn't expect to see astroturfing in this reeddit there.
why? there are already a million parking spaces accessible to the galleries directly next to the terminus, what would be the point of creating one specifically for those who take the bus?
cities have town planning regulations for the minimum number of parking spaces for each commercial building.
parking at galeries (and any other shopping center) is a requirement. not even certain that the galleries have the right to change the vocation of a part of its car parks.
indeed, it is necessary that i express myself on the issue that i am raising. my big misunderstanding is that the parking lots in the galleries of the capital are exclusively reserved for the site's customers, unless otherwise stated? of course, i imagine that we can subtly use them to take the bus only, but i would have appreciated having spaces, clear and identified, which allow me to park there with complete peace of mind without having to worry about mind that there is a significant risk of retaliation, since this is not an official park and ride strictly speaking. there are precisely cases in quebec where motorists have had consequences for having parked in commercial spaces, not dedicated to the use of rtc services.
otherwise, i have a strong impression that quebec city is not paying enough attention to the development of its park-and-ride parking network, as obsessed with the implementation of the tramway. it must be said that my opinion is quite subjective, since i moved to quebec recently and i had never used to travel by bus. a nice wildlife parking lot has been built, but only from there, downtown quebec city is 1 hour by bus. meanwhile, the charlesbourg galleries park-and-ride is on dirt, clumsily enclosed by concrete blocks. in short, all this to say that i have listed shortcomings in their management of their network which, in my opinion, are detrimental to the quality of the service offered. in fact, a car trip between my home and school takes 20 minutes, while by bus it's a good 60 minutes, and a transfer. this is exactly why i want to use park-and-ride buses; which has the potential to save me 30 minutes of bus and a transfer.
ok, i agree with you and in this case my post would be irrelevant. however, i am not sure how permissive the galleries in the capital are on the use of their parking lots for people who wish to take the bus. nowhere is it stated that it allows rtc users to park at their homes for several days. that's why i was skeptical about parking there. of course, if you tell me that everyone is doing this and that i'm not worried about anything, then i'm going to do like everyone else. i was just new to quebec and i wasn't sure how permissive the facility is, especially since there are dedicated bus rides for rtc users.
i bet you'll enjoy route 367 between st-raymond and montauban-les-mines.
here you go:
my folks used to love this road that goes from saint-gabriel-de-valcartier to tewksbury. there is a church you can stop at to eat with a nice view, and a petting zoo next door!
i used to enjoy to drive down the 171 from st-nic to scott (or furthur down) and then come back to qc on the 175
nice! thank you :d
excellent resource, thank you!
thank you!
are these the brackets? sometimes there are patients who run crazy in there, to do well, it would have to be a one-way street.
yup, it's the squares.
there is [kiji] ( which is quite well known and probably also facebook marketplace. for the price of shared apartments, it can easily be in the $ 300-400 per month if there are several of you. for the districts where to live, i advise you to be in the upper town, that is to say the [cité-universitaire] ( [saint-sacrement] ( : //goo.gl/maps/wuytnn4ywjvxbui88), [montcalm] ( and [saint-jean-baptiste] ( all of these areas are quite close to the university and the buses are very frequent and accessible.
considering that you will be visiting the university grounds often, i would look for residences on campus. otherwise, south of the pyramid, there is a lot of housing on rue chapdelaine. that way, you won't even have to take the bus. if you take the residences, you won't even have to go outside all winter (although i'm not sure that's very healthy for the brain).
ulaval residences are not very expensive and have around 85% of foreign students. there are underground tunnels that connect the residences to the different pavilions, so no need to go outside. handy when it's -40 ° c in winter.
for the first session / year, it is possibly the best choice to acclimatize.
is your lab on campus? many of the neuro labs are located in hospital research centers, and since you're in graduate school, you should spend a lot more time in the lab than on campus. this is one thing you should check before choosing accommodation: if you find yourself working at the cervo center for example, it's about an hour by bus from the university.
for transport, take either accommodation within walking distance or accommodation along the corridor between ste-foy and montcalm (or limoilou) of the 7, 800, or 801 bus. schedules late at night.
i also recommend the university residences. it is very practical to settle in the first time because internet, electricity are included, it is really cheap and on campus. the kitchens are shared so it promotes meetings. i immigrated 6 years ago, and having a reserved room at the university is one less problem to manage for the first semester. it's also a great way to meet people.
i would recommend that you go to residency for the first semester or year.
health,
yes it seems that it is at the cervo center because my supervisor is there. this is a very big tip for me! please keep me from making a mistake
just to clarify that the 7 is now the 807. the 800 series buses are the metrobus and run at a very good frequency.
in this case, i advise you to look for accommodation in more central districts (limoilou, saint-roch, saint-jean-baptiste). these are well-located neighborhoods, not too expensive, with student populations and residences, which should therefore have opportunities for shared accommodation. look for a place near the bus line 800 or 802, for easy access to cervo and the uni when needed.
you can also stay closer to cervo, in maizerets, to be within walking distance, but it's a neighborhood that i find less interesting for a student.
ah that's good! it's been a while since i left ste-foy.
not so much if you're the type of person who goes to the grocery store.
it's pleasant a few years. the next logical step is to go down to limoilou.
i want to inform you that your username remains true for old quebec.
if you have a car, no. there are almost no parking lots and traffic is difficult. also, the buildings are generally very old and therefore the insulation and the heating leave something to be desired, the electricity bill will be correspondingly. it is also generally noisy and busy. the good thing is to live in one of the most beautiful cities in america and to be within walking distance of everything. if you like this way of life, it will be fantastic for you!
i moved there on july 1st, so it's been two months (before i was in montcalm and i arrived in quebec in 2019, so that's the only comparison i can make).
i don't have a car and live well because i plan my groceries or i use delivery, but there are always local grocery stores for emergencies. personally, i like the fact that it moves more, there are a lot of people all the time and it seems alive, but that can be annoying for someone who prefers a more "suburban" atmosphere. i'm telecommuting right now, staying close to place d'youville and getting around quite well on foot / by bike, so getting around is never a problem. as for the building, well it's an older building, make sure it's well run and well maintained and don't expect fancy / upscale decor and you're gonna be okay.
in short, if you find a good apartment at a good price (i was), take it. on the other hand, i would not make any additional efforts to try to find one in the area.
it's good but far from services // a lot of tourists if you are in the doors.
if you want to go to the grocery store easily, no.
limoilou, st-sauveur, saint-sacrement, st-roch would be better.
an old building is very beautiful, but it is not the most soundproof.
funny people say there is no service. in the suburbs we are often 5/10 minutes by car from the grocery store and we say that we are close to services. in old quebec, too, we are 5/10 minutes by car from the grocery stores, but in addition there are also 5/10 minutes on foot. and even if you don't have a car, it's easy to take a communauto to go to maxi / costco / home depot / winners / bureau en gros / whatever.
i am also without a car and frankly, i think this is the only place i would like to live in quebec. i am in the lower town on st-paul near the old port. lots of restaurants, interesting neighborhoods are within walking distance, i have access to the marina and the sailing school and the metro st-roch grocery store is quite a walk away. bicycle path and community garden next door. with à vélo (electric bicycle assistance), trips to montcalm, saint-sauveur and limoilou are greatly facilitated. access to old quebec to take steps. palace station (via rail) to take the train or bus to other cities. not bad the ideal pedestrian in a city designed especially for cars. you can find really expensive condos to buy but beware, there will be a lot of maintenance expenses so you have to save money.
this is ok but i would say 1.5x more for not much benefit. you have to understand that in other big cities, generally everything happens in the city center and it is there that we find a concentration of services or places of work.
in quebec, old quebec is more of an entertainment center, but not really practical in everyday life. places like sainte-foy are more commercial, places like limoilou are stronger on local services, and it is very easy to go to old quebec from there.
i live in the upper town and love it, i've been there for several years and the car-free lifestyle works very easily. there are several small neighborhood grocery stores and it is easy to get by. if you are interested in the old town, i would recommend that you target the st-jean batiste district, which is better suited to having residents. champlain is cool but very touristy and it seems… on st-jean, you can easily go down to other cool neighborhoods while enjoying an interesting community.
if you want to live in an old building and you like going to the saint-jean baptiste grocery store is a good compromise. in addition, you are between montcalm and old quebec!
st jean baptiste district❤️
too expensive, no grocery store, not very accessible by bus beyond the ramparts ...
no service
true, i live in petit-champlain, and walmart delivery is a live saver!
i don’t own a car btw!
> the next logical step is to get off at limoilou.
why?
i would be curious to know what other experiences you have in other cities in canada to compare?
cheaper, fewer tourists, easier to get around, a real neighborhood community vs. tourist economy / corporations in the upper town, etc.
yes. in toronto "canada housing sucks" because it is very very very very expensive. quebec seems like a miracle in comparison
i was a little surprised because limoilou is not popular even though it is where i am now.
truly? i have the impression that it is very “fashionable”, with st-sauveur.
it is less sterile than other parts of the city.
if the temperature is nice, go to le sacrilège, they have the best terrace in town and the ambiance is usually festive. also, one of my favorite bar is le macfly. if you like arcades, you'll feel like it's heaven!
for live music, in old quebec, you should look up to st-angèle however.
"blue eyes" is much more touristic.
les yeux bleus is small and cozy but you won't get top notch beer there. i recommend ninkasi, i go there all the time and they offer a good variety of beers, good food and they also close at 2am if i'm not mistaken. nelligan is also worth checking out (it's in the same area), as well as le projet but you might have to walk for a bit to get there - it's worth the walk though, they have some delicious beers that no other bar offers.
you could go to « la cour arriere du festibiere » which is a pretty unique spot in quebec city. it’s basically an outside bar in a small waterpark located in the old port. its best to go there for happy hours, since it closes at 11pm.
pub st alexandre would be perfect for what you want, but it's a bit expensive as it's in the heart of rue st-jean in the busiest area (touristy), but it's fun. good pub food as well. specializes in belgian beers, not sure how much local craft beer they carry, i haven't been there in a while.
le projet is nice but gets crowded easily.
sacrilège and ninkasi as users have said, lots of fun to be had there. i'd like to add le fou bar also, fun little bar.
if you intend on partying and le bateau de nuit is still open, it's definitely worth the walk. it's in the same area as sacrilège, le projet, nelligan and ninkasi, you can hit them all up in the same night.
beauty of all these places is that they're all on the same street (rue st-jean), so if you want to try more than one, that's where i'd head out.
le sacrilège has the best exterior terrace in town. la ninkasi is a place with a younger crowd which could be nice too. if you want a super nice place with a kitschy decor and an awesome staff, i’d suggest la cuisine on st. vallier street in st. roch. i hope you’ll have a great birthday !
the carole.
night boat.
st-angele is dope
that's a very valid point. if i don't like a certain place, i have a handful of options right next door.
i'll look into st. alexandre. i don't mind if it's more expensive to be honest. any other day of the year i would care, but if it's cozy and has a great ambience, i'll be more than happy.
le sacrilège was my second choice. looks beautiful and cozy. the only problem is that it closes at 11pm. i'll definitely look into the other two though. thank you for taking the time to reply and give great suggestions!
i think you’ll be all set with the st. alexandre, i’ve had a few birthdays there and it was always fun.
for vegetables, fruiterie 440 is always a good bet for low cost. no credit card tho.
good morning!
it really depends on your budget. iga is the most pricy, metro can also be. however, fruits, vegetables and meats are better quality there.
walmart, super c, maxi can be interesting for bulk buying. walmart can also be good for meat/fruits/vegetables, but the quality is less good than iga/metro. 
costco is also a good idea, but i would say the best would be to compare the price of all. 
for example, some things at wall mart can be more expensive than elsewhere (fruits), but better on one. 
another thing i can add is to look for seasonal product. for example, right now, many vegetables are available from quebec, making the price for them lower.
fruiterie 440 best spot in the city for vegetables and fruits at low price. walmart for chicken breast you will never see cheaper anywhere else with that quality (20$ for 4lbs). they also have good deals on sausage. 
super c and maxi may have cheaper price on meat but i don't trust them anymore on the quality. 
iga is too expensive for me. sometimes x2 price and the product is not x2 quality
if you want something fancy go to le frigo in limoilou, it's a store made from "extras" of order from restaurants. so you have a really good quality of products and it is worth the price !
maxi and super c for me.
there is also the large farmers market at expo cite. it's easy to find, just look for the huge alien spacecraft docked there. it's visible from just about anywhere in the city.
super c/maxi/costco
if you got a car, [le frigo]( in limoilou, just north of the train tracks from the videotron center has a good quality/price ratio on food of all sorts, including fruits, vegetables and especially meat and fish. it's small, so choice may be a bit limited, but it's worth a visit.
fruiterie 440 for fruits and veggies, maxi  or walmart for everything not meat, metro, iga or a local butcher shop for meat, metro plus or iga extra for specific/ethnic stuff/brand, costco for basically everything in bulk.
i personally very rarely eat meat so i’m going to maxi every week and it costs me less than $100 weekly for 2 adults (sometimes not even $50)
walmart and super c have most of the time aubaines that end up being the same price as 440. i used to eat at minimum budget with only walmart, super c and dollarama.
i’d say walmart. but they don’t have as much variety. 
you can also download foodhero to get food that’s frozen and about to expire, it’s still good to eat however.
maxi
ah, okay! i was wondering about maxi! thank you very much for all of the info :d :d :d
>fruiterie 440 best spot in the city for vegetables and fruits at low price. walmart for chicken breast you will never see cheaper anywhere else with that quality (20$ for 4lbs). they also have good deals on sausage.super c and maxi may have cheaper price on meat but i don't trust them anymore on the quality.iga is too expensive for me. sometimes x2 price and the product is not x2 qualityif you want something fancy go to le frigo in limoilou, it's a store made from "extras" of order from restaurants. so you have a really good quality of products and it is worth the price !
amazing, thank you!!
thank you!!
thank you!!!
wow! that's a great weekly spend limit. thank you for the info!!
thank you!!!
that's amazing, thank you! just downloaded foodhero :d
maxi is the cheapest « chain » if costco is not an option.
different food for different maxi, i think the one in fleur the lys vanier has some exotic fruit/vegetables your can’t find elsewhere.
for maxi i may be wrong, but pretty 7 years ago the quality for vegetables and fruits and meat was bad. for example, i already saw molding on cauliflowers, the meat was to be eat immediately. it may have changed since then!
i really dislike fruits and vegetables from costco. they may be cheap, but they are usually over-ripe and you will throw a bunch away, or they just taste bland. and with the quantity they come in, it becomes too wasteful (so, expensive). but i usually shop at iga and metro, so maybe it's just that i'm picky.
cochon dingue on lebourgneuf blvd seems to be what you’re looking for in terms of food. they’ll accept assistance dogs i’m pretty sure.
barberie is a microbrewery which welcomes kids *and* dogs on their huge terrasse/patio. they have a rotating menu and sometimes some guest restaurants replace that menu.
in the past, you could bring your own food there as long as you bought some drinks. not sure they still do that now though. just contact them by phone or facebook messenger to make sure.
they also serve non-alcoolhic beverage.
côte-à-côte in the petit champlain (touristic area) is a wonderful grill house / ribs place that is dog friendly, allowed inside and outside.
by the way look into chasseautresor.ca
it's a treasure hunt/escape game sort of thing across the city. there's an english toggle on the site. it's a great way to discover the city and have fun with your kid.
dogs are allowed on the 737 site and it is very family friendly.
if it's an assistance dog you can go where ever you want, if not good luck.
quebec city is not dog friendly at all… you will find very few places accepting dogs on the patio, mostly cafés. sorry.
you could consider ordering take out and eat in a park…
the most family friendly restaurant would be normandin. they have many locations and it’s a quebec city based chains appreciated by locals.
dîner st-sauveur will tolerate your dog. food should be alright for your kid too.
florence cafe in pointe st charles has what you are looking for.  plus dog friendly. and plus plus the best damn coffee in montreal hands down.  we are 2 pro chef's  who would be happy to guide you to better eats with dog friendly killer tested restaurants
thank you! he is just a regular pet though.
thanks
thanks those are great tips.
i know right! unfortunately he is just a regular family dog.
even if the pooch is not a bona fide certified assistant dog just tell the staff that the animal is essential for keeping your autistic kid calm and well-behaved. given that situation many if not most will oblige... provided the dog is well behaved itself. assistant dogs are fairly common in the city and well tolerated by almost anyone.
quite a few places allowed our dog on their patio. no one said no to us.
she said she had an autistic child who didn't want to go to a restaurant with autism
isn’t it like 300 kms away from quebec city?
thank you! it looks delicious there. it's in montreal, not quebec city though!
i don't really know the restaurant but i'm curious to know what made you say that hahahaha
250
2.5 hours driving the speed limit 
i once did it in 52 mins driving my twin turbo volvo wagon 960
when i moved to quebec in 88 i lived in vieux quebec ste foi sillery et cap rouge.
i started recycling in this province in 90 with the then mayor  of ste foi
go ahead you will understand
the staff is * particular *?
honestly, i walk past it regularly and there's absolutely nothing that prompts me to go and try it. it just looks… pocket.
it's pocket indeed, but autistic people were a joke
i'm interested!
/ u / thegreathulk7 might be interested too.
very interesting
for those interested, i'll be doing a follow-up post in the coming weeks on this subreddit! goodbye!
the falls might ask a car or a taxi. as for visiting the old town, maybe it would be best to get a wheelchair. you can take the "funicalaire" to go to the champlain street, it really worth it.
i think you might find some info there. i think you should look into renting some kind of electric mobility scooter if you can cause there are some steep hills in the touristy part of town. not necessary but it could save you a lot of pushing, and it can get really humid and hot. i'll try to find some options.
your best bet is probably the old quebec, its the most touristy/historic part and there are parking garages that are pretty accessible and that drop you out right there. quebec is basically built on a big hill, so mobility from there might be a little tough, but there is lots to see and do all within a kilometer radius. the plains are also right there if you're looking for an easy picnic sort of thing.
there is the section at the bottom of the hill that is flat - but on top of the hill is very hilly. the long streets have gradual slopes, but the connecting streets can be steep. start at a high point and then walk down. if you have to go up again - maybe take a cab. its flat on the balcony near chateau frontenac. the canicule ride is great. parking is tough. i’d find a good parking lot and just leave the car there. i like the one at place youville. there are elevators. start at a high level and walk downwards in the city. just take cabs if you have to go back up and he cannot make it. its a small place but full of a lot of things and very steep on some streets.
you'll want to mainly be in the vieux québec, that's where most of the interesting places are and they tend to be close to each other. 
make sure to drop by tutto gelato on st-jean and the musée de la civilisation. a pizza garnie from casse-croute pierrot should be nice too.
be sure you speak french, or anywhere outside of château frontenac and the tourist area will treat you like shit lol
thank you so much, this is the info i needed. hopefully cabs are easy to come by.
the musée de la civilization has a current [exhibition] ( about shit.
you get ac and probably a wheel chair if a person need to rest a little bit.
if you like water, kind of niagara falls, go see the [parc de la chute-montmorency]( but need to walk a little bit.
all great suggestion. will add them to the list.
untrue!
i was there last weekend, it's completely true.
i guess you were really unlucky, people are generally helpful and 50% of folks on here can speak decent english.
>i guess you were really ~~unlucky~~ a dick,
cpt
i wonder if the anti-tramway voters who voted quebec 21 in the last election will vote for them again with an even more expensive project, a project drawn on a napkin that holds up with scotch tape.
i hope he will do well in the election.
his entire campaign line fits on his metro.
it's good to be in opposition that's it.
it's not a real project, it's just an attempt to delay the tram.
we say quebec, not quebec city. ;)
otherwise, it depends on your job and your interests. the question is rather vague!
if you have kids, you should be fine. they will make friends at school and want to go play with them, take the opportunity to accompany them and meet their parents. go to the park and socialize. you can also sign them up for sports if they are interested (soccer, baseball, etc.) and everyone will talk to you. greet the neighbors if you see them outside and go introduce yourself. get out there, as they say, it will be done quite naturally, people are quite sociable.
invest in warm and waterproof clothing, it is essential. people don't stop themselves from going out in the winter and there are plenty of outdoor activities. children will want to play in the snow. if you are not dressed well you will get cold and hate it. on the contrary, well dressed is really not that bad.
above all, you need to sign up for activities if you want to meet people.
there are 1001 different activities that few people can sign up for, ranging from jiu jitsu classes, ceramic painting, dancing, history, clay pigeon shooting, skiing, fishing, ski-doo and so much more.
just do things you love and you'll meet people who share your interests

spend halloween, if you have kids;
get involved in your community, etc.
the neighborhood in which you will be will influence the types of activities possible without having to travel by car.
take the time to get to know your host neighborhood :)
ahahah quebec city. the name of the province comes from its capital. we differentiate in french by saying to quebec / from quebec for the city and quebec / from quebec for the province
there are sites that suggest activities, [the city's] ( itself (a little different due to the pandemic, but normally it there is a list of activities accessible through the home page named [* ideas for outings *] ( )). and [what to do in quebec] (
edit: while waiting for everything to return to normal, post-pandemic, the facebook group quebec city multilingual meetup (qcmm) offers meetings to practice different languages, including french and english. you could kill two birds with one stone, either helping those who are learning to use the two languages you speak and making a network of friends. during the lockdown, the meetings took place online.
what do you like to do for fun? maybe someone can suggest a group for your interests.
thanks for the valuable advice.
thanks, it sounds basic but it's heartwarming.
thanks for the resourceful material and groups. sounds great!
obviously, knowing your neighbors is a "must". any other more concrete and specific suggestions?
ah well that is much clearer. novice error, i admit.
like i said, it depends on the neighborhood :)
i lived for 11 years in limoilou, i took the time to ask questions, discuss and listen to receptive people:
* from the bakery at the corner of 13th street and 1st avenue
* at the local municipal library on 4th avenue
* from the local hardware store
* 3-4 cafes in the neighborhood
* in the various neighborhood festivals
i like ornithology and i walked regularly in the linear park of the saint-charles river and i met very nice people there.
it's a pedestrian area so it made that kind of contact easier.
i am in a suburb far north of the city today and the covid and our cars cut us off quite a bit from these interesting contacts, but there are always oases of meeting :)
[deleted]
i have been in the last district north of charlesbourg (notre-dame-des-laurentides) since december 2020 only but here are my finds in the area to chat with strangers and potentially make friends
* charlesbourg cross-country ski club and their extremely well-maintained trails
* coffee parlabas
* butcher vic verret
* neighborhood library
* neighborhood skate park
* indigenous street park
* linear park of the river of the rocks
* rocks mountain park
* charlesbourg running club
funny, i was wondering the other day if this is an old volleyball court
i'm probably talking out of my ass, but i understood that it was both a space for _including-the-activity-of-your-choice_ and at the same time a buffer zone when the river overflows.
i can't say if they serve in english, it will be difficult to find. but in french you have la patente.
this is like the toaster i had in college 25 years ago! it was already a hand me down from my grandma, what you have there must be at least 30++ years old. awesome.
there are repair café events organized every once in a while by la patente, but i don't know if they are still happening during the pandemic. search for either of those terms on facebook, maybe find an old event and subscribe to the group that organized it.
otherwise, maybe l'acorderie could help you. it's a network of service exchange : you offer services you can do for people (like help them learn/practice their russian), and get *paid* in recorded hours to your account you can then exchange for any other member's services, like repairing your toaster.
good luck!
🤣🤣i laughed when i saw this. a toasted 🤣 best of luck though!!
i had the same toaster when i grew up, this bring back so many memories of my mornings before school. have you tried searching for diy repair tutorials on youtube to see if it is possible or easy to repair?
thank you! i love the tool library in la patente, it sounds awesome
it means the toaster is my age mate, now i surely have to save it!
thank you, this sounds cool. never heard about l'accorderie, will look into it
thanks, i haven't thought about video tutorials, i will look into it
i never went there, but it seems pretty cool :)
i have had a monthly subscription for a few years at the parking lot at place des canotiers near the musée de la civilization. it costs $ 117.50 / month for residents and you need proof of residence if my memory serves me correctly because it's a different rate for workers (to be confirmed). i don't know if the price is different in the other downtown parking lots, but by calling the spaq (organization that manages the parking lots), they will have all the answers!
there is monthly underground parking next to the palais montcalm as well as at the convention center. i didn't like being subscribed to one or the other though so i can't help you more.
there is the cité médicale at place de la cité which offers walk-in services. no need to have a file on site. the wait can be long, but normally if you arrive early (7 am-7.30am, doors open at 7.30am) you can go through very quickly. it helped my husband who does not have a family doctor.
there is also the health info service (811) which you can call when you are not sure whether you should go to the hospital or not, you are talking to a nurse.
laval university offers certain medical services to students, but i don't know if they can do a blood test. here is the website of the laval university medical clinic: 
it's in the desjardins pavilion on the 2nd floor, above the co-op.
i think it's worth calling them; even if they don't offer the service they will be able to direct you.
i would tend to believe that you have to go to a clsc for a blood test.
the university's medical clinic can meet with you and give you a check-up request form if that's what you need.
you can then go to the chul with the form to take the blood test. they will send the results to the ul clinic who will call you back to give you the results.
a clue for you regarding the family doctor: do your registration normally, but after that try to go directly to clinics to ask them if they are taking on new patients.
they will almost surely tell you no so you ask them if they can take your contact details to contact you when a place becomes available.
that's what i did. not only did i find a doctor relatively quickly, but he is within walking distance of my home.
i have a friend who doesn't want to do this so he's still been in the waiting girl for 5 years.
obviously there is no guarantee of success, but you have nothing to lose.
on the private side there is also the medicina clinic with far more affordable rates than lacroix ([and less strange ideas] ( will-have-to-face-the-disciplinary-board)).
you can easily get an appointment with a nurse clinician in less than 48 hours.
check with clinics near you: in the context of a pandemic, some clinics have opened their doors to “non-registered” customers. you can therefore go to their walk-in even if you don't have a doctor at this clinic.
thank you very much i will start here before going elsewhere! it is very much appreciated!
80% of income comes from food and drink!
it is really impressive! much more than i thought!
80% of * income *. i thought it was even more than that, but maybe i was thinking more about * profits *. the cost of the ticket is sent almost in full to the distributor, who then returns a good part of it to the studios that produced the film. but food and drink cost three times nothing to produce and almost all of the cost remains with the owner of the cinema.
it's not such a bad thing actually, because without it cinemas just wouldn't exist. or the cost of the tickets would be 2-3 times more expensive.
i missed this story. what is the rationale for reopening cinemas but not allowing the sale of popcorn?
covidiots are public danger fucking
it's very possible, but you have to choose a location accordingly. which in practice means near the métrobus lines. consult [the rtc website] ( and test the routes on google maps before choosing where you will stay.
don't kid yourself, quebec is a city made for cars. it is possible to live without a car by relying on buses or bikes, but only if you live and work in the districts of limoilou, st-roch, st-sauveur, vieux quebec, montcalm, ste-foy, sillery. the densest neighborhoods and even there for certain services, you will waste a lot of time without a car.
so it's done, but depending on what you want to do, it's less easy to live in quebec without a car than in european cities or montreal.
i would like to add that the communauto service is very practical to have a car when you need it or to go on weekends.
it's entirely possible! the reasonable distance varies from person to person (personally, i absolutely want to be able to make the trip on foot). depending on the route, the buses are usually quite efficient, and despite the winter, many are equipped to be able to cycle in winter anyway. it's difficult and definitely more dangerous, but possible :)
bus and feet!
some brave people ride * fat bikes * in the snow in the winter, and it's perfectly possible, albeit a bit tough at times.
in general, it is bus and foot for everyone who does not have a car or a parking space.
excellent! thanks for your answers, it helps me a lot!
i will take the time to take a good look at the map and the bus networks before choosing a neighborhood.
the advantage is that if i have no vehicle costs, i will be more free (financially speaking) for the choice of the district. 😊
st-roch or vieux-limoilou. to be avoided for the rest of the city. it's still quite a bit of the old “all in the car” mentality in quebec.
edit: negativotez as you want, i live in quebec and i lived without a car until 36 years old. i know what i mean.
at -5 ° c by bike 10km is very good (well prepared). below -10 ° c i find long bike trips difficult but 2-3km is very reasonable. there are studded winter tires for bikes! when you have that it's safer than on foot.
on foot, you probably know your limits, even in france but with a bigger coat and a toque. add crampons to your feet if there has been ice.
in quebec, the difficulty is the coasts which become rather dangerous when they are icy. the ideal is to get in line with the 800 buses which have bike racks for users.
the bus system is good for the most demanded places. it greatly depends on where you live and where you work.
in quebec, it's very difficult to avoid the car for some trips. if you avoid the car 100%, some trips will be longer, and some places will not be accessible by bus. this does not mean that it is necessary to own a vehicle.
for winter, you can walk in the cold if you have a snowmobile suit.
for the bus, it is [rtcquebec] ( i have the [perso bus subscription] subscription (
to go to lévis (south shore of the st. lawrence river), take the [stl] bus (
to go to montreal by bus, it's [orléans express] ( / kéolis
to rent a car, you can subscribe to [communauto] ( i am a subscriber with the economy plan. there is a discount because i have the bonne bus.
finally, when we go on vacation (example: saguenay), we rent a vehicle with [discount] (
little question like that, do the buses run during the night (or late evening) or the weekend (more than once an hour)? i tried looking on the rtc site, but couldn't find much.
it depends on the neighborhood, if it's in old-limoilou, saint-sauveur, old-québec, saint-roch, yes it's very possible to get by without a car and a rtc pass for what's more far at worst. in ste-foy on the other hand, big ones everywhere, it's much better in the car
quebec is garbage!
as a french person living here for a few years. some clothing advice: the essentials are the hat (the toque), gloves / mittens, neck warmer or scarf (scarf here). a * real * winter coat (buy it here) and not too heavy snow boots like moonboots.
st-jean-baptiste is also great without a car and the east of st-sauveur
i know lots of people who live without a car all over town: charlesbourg, duberger, ste-foy, montcalm, beauport, even the south shore. i myself have done it for a long time.
of course, not everything is perfectly wonderful, but it is very doable.
thank you for all the info ! super nice this sharing of links. i saw that there was also the québec-levis ferry. is it feasible if i am placed with a client in this city?
thanks for your advice ! indeed i think rather to leave france with the summer clothes, and the winter ones will be taken on the spot! 😁
in view of the cost of the container, i will certainly do a return trip in may or i will leave things with friends in montreal, before the one-way trip where i will take the remaining things.
exactly, with just the bus, you can't go everywhere. in my opinion, communauto solves this problem.
yes, with an rtc subscription, you can use the ferry to reach quebec and lévis.
if you go to [the rtc website,] ( you will see that there is kind one million bus trips. it's still a bit difficult to see.
there are the green buses, which are metrobuses. there are 6 métrobus routes: 800, 801, 802, 803, 804, 807. the 807 has this number because before, it was route 7. 800 + 7 = 807 i imagine. the others are numbered from 800.
the 800 and 801 must have been around for> 15 years.
the blue "lebus" trips, there are> 50 trips. i only use 11 and 80 and 25.
the red express journeys, there are> 50 journeys. it is to bring workers from the suburbs to downtown quebec (terminus d'youville). currently, with covid, the red express routes are out of service.
the black "couche-tard" routes, i am not aware of.
[the 6 arrondissements of quebec city] ( are connected by the 6 green métrobus routes.
| number | end a | end b | connects to terminus d'youville (center-ville de québec) | notes |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

edit: spelling
yes, in downtown quebec, the bus route 11 leaves from terminus place d'youville, and goes to the ferry.
according to the rtc (réseau de transport de la capitale) of quebec city:
_holders of a monthly rtc pass or a monthly metropolitan pass can use the québec-lévis ferry for free._
good idea and good luck! 😉
the people i know who live without a car don't travel only by bus: communauto, yes, but also bicycles and taxis, if necessary.
i don't know where you are from, but we have some great escape rooms! cabinet mysteriis, sos adventures, exodus, save who can, and more.
otherwise, there is also lasertag or ax throwing.
roc gym for climbing
i like to play ping pong at the green carpet in ste-foy, it's a kind of dooly's but there are ping pong tables.
bora park!
mega parc des galeries de la capitale can be funny
delirium climbing (bouldering, not tied)
we come from rimouski
thanks for the recommendations
double tour is without a doubt the best place for escape games! all the rooms have fantastic settings. sauve qui peut is also very good and i recommend the bar clandestin.
i liked their last rooms less, but i really loved alice! i regularly recommend the prison to introduce people to escape!
i have a weakness for chez boulay personally
but for an event, i always go to heaven.
[le hobbit]( 
it is not between the walls but very close. i have been there plenty of times and have never been disappointed. excellent food and excellent
 service.
if you have time (because you have to book well in advance) battuto is really good and good atmosphere with few tables. otherwise, congratulations on your diploma!
apologies in advance, as i can read french better than i can speak/type it.  my experience with le hobbit has always been great when i have visited.  also, if you dont mind spending money, panache was great....but i dont know if it's still the same restaurant.  another i would add is le lupín.
the apsara sur d'auteuil
buvette scott manne
congratulations on your diploma! there are a lot of great suggestions, but i would add bo cuisine d'asie, the diamant's new restaurant. this is my 2021 crush.
if you are looking for good food at a lower cost in old quebec, there is chez temporel. the atmosphere is really warm, they make great french food (croque-monsieur style, for example), they have good beers / coffees and a super good apple pie! it might not be the most upscale place to celebrate something, but personally it's my favorite restaurant in the area, it's low key and isn't known to tourists so your ears won't ring at the end. of the evening. ;)
i love going to the taverne louise, great service, relaxed atmosphere but the same party.
the clan: 
i wanted to go to a nice restaurant with my boyfriend to celebrate the end of my late night session that i can't wait to finish when the time is right. i also wanted to go to the old, it makes your question kill two birds with one stone, i'll read the suggestions too! :-)
i went to légendes a few weeks ago. it was "ok" for the price but nothing to pitch on the walls.
i googled this for you:
boulay x2 the concept of taking as many products as possible from quebec (even spices). culinary research over there is just too sick!
no problem, thanks for the input 🙂
> apologies in advance, as i can read french better than i can speak/type it.
try the same, that's how we learn.
yeah it's really good and sought after. there is no real equivalent in quebec in my opinion.
i don't know why you got downvoted for your comment.  i just have such a tough time with the spelling aspect/phonetics of french.  i studied spanish and german and their structure and phonetics makes so much more sense to me as a native english speaker
i think you should mention your age, interests etc, you'd have higher chances of having replies
i'm also temporarily moving to the city from the gta tomorrow, and will be staying until at least the end of november.
my plan is to learn as much french as i can while enjoying the city's restaurants and breweries.
i'll be going with a couple friends from university, but i'd love to expand our social circle during our stay.
i'm a 35 y.o. guy, working as a translator (not french translation unfortunately...). enjoy good food and drink and exploring new places. sadly, i've forgotten almost all of my elementary/hs french, but i'm hoping to at least be able to hold a simple conversation after my time in the city!
bienvenue ! perfectly bilingual and love to show this beautiful city dm for deets
i'm staying here until december too. i don't really know the city but me and my friend are always down to have drinks and meet people
welcome/ bienvenue. hope you will enjoy the old quebec!
25 who just moved here from toronto. interested in hiking and nature as well. pm me
may i ask which language(s) you work with?
well i am in the same boat in terms of language ability. i learned french in hs for couple years and forgot all of it lol... would love to connect with you
thank you ! will connect with you
thanks for the suggestion! i have updated my post.
i work with japanese and english.
nice! are you japanese yourself, or you learnt it as a second language?
not japanese, but i lived and studied there in my youth. i'd highly recommend visiting if you're interested, it's a great place to see!
unfortunately, now my french apparently has a japanese accent. so i feel like i'm offending multiple groups of people whenever i attempt to say anything, haha.
it's on my bucket list. and don't worry too much about your accent in french. in the words of sidney sheldon in windmills of the gods :
>just remember, when someone has an accent, it means that he knows one more language than you do.
i love living in the vieux, but here's why.
extremely hard to maintain as they are old structures, very limited renovation options as they are almost all heritage sites, can't even use modern windows or doors so these buildings are more expensive to heat in our brutal winters (but we do get wood burning fireplaces so... yay?) many lack decent balcony or yard space. it feels like every window is perfectly lined up with a house across the street so you'll quickly learn your neighbour's routines. i don't even bother keeping it quiet during sex any more, either way half the street will hear it. 
pretty much guaranteed to end up living in a building co-owned by nosey often single old ladies who have nothing better to do then complain about anything and everything you do.
living with tourists gets kinda annoying. i absolutely love my place but opening my door in the morning to instagram influenceures doing a photo shoot while i'm just trying to live my life and bring in groceries or something is hella annoying. also the complete lack of respect people seem to have for local residents is pretty bad. drunk parties running down the street singing their heads off and reverberating off the bricks and directly entering your living space isn't fun. sometimes i can swear the noise is coming from inside my house. even on the second floor, someone on street level is like only ever 15 or 20 feet away from you. kinda makes any street facing rooms only for none daytime activity, tourists have nothing better to do but try and look into your apartment (should you be on the ground floor) and the city places these plaques on certain houses so you'll sometimes wake up with a old boomer with a camera around his neck literal inches from your front windows trying to read the plaque, they'll catch a glimpse of you doing your thing and low and behold be completely shattered once they are again reminded that people live here and this isn't some disney-esque fake village and i am not a paid actor to make it feel "authentic".
the tour groups are kinda funny. i'm pretty sure i've seen the entire ghost tour staff and the plains of abraham people walking around. they're kinda funny, why anyone even does those group tours i'll never know. and that red double decker sight seeing bus literally rolls coal. it's such a sooty old diesel that i honestly hope it gets banned just in the interest of public health, and due to narrow streets it will undoubtedly hit you with a giant puff of black smoke eventually.
oh and short term rentals / airbnb is illegal.
it is absurdly expensive compared to the rest of the city.
also, look at median income for the territory.
because right now you have about 14 condo sellers for every buyer in montcalm and inside the walls.
you pretty much covered it all..  i'll add a few.
\-parking is a nightmare
\-be ready to spend 15-20%-ish more for basic supplies
\-plumbing/electricity is pretty much a rag-tag made by non-plumber/electricians that spans over a few generations (i have entire circuit loops in my apartment that respond to a breaker in someone elses)
\-if you think snow plows are noisy,  try 'em and loaders when surrounded by stone walls.
\-forget about silent mornings..  all those restaurants and bars need supplies...  from 7-11 am,  it's delivery trucks galore
\-during summer season.. the main arteries are pedestrian only from 11 am to 11 pm.  it can take you half an hour to cover 5 blocks to bring back your groceries home, on emergency blinkers,  and another half hour to go to a parking lot.
\-it took about a year and a half for my landlord to get the permit to change a part of the heating system.   and he's still waiting, after about 3 years, for a permit to change 4 inefficient windows because,...  as u/b-rad-israd said,  heritage sites...
\-do you like hoboes (for lack of a better term) pissing and having diarhea on your doorsteps?  i hope you do. (edit: and/or drunk ppl)
\-also an entire set of rules about garbage...  like getting a ticket because you dropped them too early since you know...  it's not cool that tourists realize that real ppl live here.
\-forget about a quick in-and-out to the convenience store, coffee shop or bakery...  there are already 30 tourists in line who don't understand the concept of efficiency.
don't get me wrong..  i've been living in old quebec for most of my adult life and i wouldn't change it for anything in the world.. i love it here...  but it really isn't for everybody.
lol, i was thinking of moving to the old one and finally, i'm going to stay in blessed sacrament
thank you for the detailed reply.
i see that, thanks for pointing it out.
is it a buyer's market? might be interested in buying a condo in montcalm eventually
lord, you make me realize that i am easy in old limoilou!
thanks, things i hadnt thought about.
imo, old limoilou is pretty much the best place to stay if you want to live in a more urban area. saint-so is not worse too.
> "i don't understand what you are doing in my country."
what a bitch.
thanks for sharing it makes me really sad. i'm somewhat close from there. and i wouldn't have stand for such disrespect. my heart goes to the family.
lol nasty doves comments
i want to give the benefit of the doubt to the lady making the complaint, but i would like to know the other version of the cashier before taking out my pitchfork and my rocks.
dirty waste of society you see say it should be illegal and punishable by a hefty fine
do you want to have his boss's version? he squealed it out.
a press release from a third party is not a straightforward version of the facts.
let it be stun imbecile finished
the first thing is a bollard. it's an obstacle put in place to keep vehicles from hitting driving up onto sidewalks or hitting buildings. usually you see them around industrial buildings, just straight steel tubes filled with concrete and painted yellow. in this case it's fancier because it's in am area frequented by tourists - i believe it was taken in the old port, right?
i think the second one is probably a way-finding symbol left over from a festival. they usually disappear after a few winters.
edit: just out of curiosity, where are you coming back from? i take it you were born here and went abroad...  
in my case, i'm originally from california, but i've been here half my life now.
if you know anything about québec you'll know that we don't mind if your french "sucks", we always appreciate the effort!
as has already been said, the first one is a bollard, second picture is hard to tell. maybe if you follow the arrow you'll find something nice?
newly returned to london on from qcqc....no one in qc asked knew what they were
4+ cup or sampler from tutto gelato on st jean. great ice cream. 
poutine from casse-croute pierrot. it's a working class diner. cheap and hearty. i haven't tried the vegetarian pizza but the pizza of theirs i've tried is among the best i've ever had. 
authentic quebec food and vegetarian options may not intersect very much.
poutine in old town: snack bar st-jean, gaston if you're willing to go down the hill
pizza in old town: nina pizza
butter tart: no clue
other recommendations: donkey bonnet, chic shack, arugula for ice cream
nina pizza napolitaine on st. jean street, they have an authentic stone oven from italy and their pizzas are incredible (they also have veggie options). 
other places i haven’t tried but heard good things about : le hobbit, le bonnet d’âne, la buvette scott and le billig.
bistro hortus on st-jean street might be an option. you’ll find great vegetarian options there, if the price range fits.
buffet de l'antiquaire got really great local cuisine feel, but there's probably a line-up since there's not a lot of space.
depending on your budget, bistro hortus is a great vegetarian choice. au jardin chez muffy (auberge st-antoine) offer some fresh plate with homegrown vegetables. might not be full stomach after though. restaurant bashir probably got the best shish taouk & falafel in the city.
i'm much more of a downtown foodie than a uptown one, so some great options on st-joseph street and st-vallier street also. le restaurant ness is a good daytime vegetarian option. le clocher penché is almost a must. le renard et la chouette might be too far from your location, but it is some of the best keep secret restaurant in this city.
this website is probably the best for searching where and what to eat in the city. [
enjoy!
tagging onto this - any recommendations for takeout? or delivery?
wife and i were going to go out for a nice meal but the baby isn't cooperating.
i’ve heard good things about don vegan but they’re pretty busy and you’ll need to book a reservation in advance.
hey, check it out! this comment contains every letter in the alphabet.
i have checked 229266 comments and 1015 of them contain every letter in the alphabet.
but is there no 'x'?

1- things are still going well for international flights from quebec city airport. there is usually a connection somewhere (like montreal or toronto) but i never found it complicated. it costs a little more than leaving montreal but not enough (in my opinion) to deserve the trouble.
2- i really like the neighborhood you are considering! :) i think all elementary schools in quebec have a relatively good reputation. not far from the neighborhood where you think you live there is the fernand-seguin school which is one of the best in the city. i wouldn't spend on jesus-mary personally, i think the neighborhood school is good enough.
on your first point: a lot of travel is going to depend on covid—right now, international flights can only fly in and out of vancouver, calgary, toronto, and montreal. obviously that’s not going to last forever, and yqb is eager to start bringing in/attracting international routes again, but airlines are going to be slow to add those routes back. so, the short answer is that montreal is almost always going to be a much better bet for european flights. and there are plenty of options for getting there. i believe via runs/ran a shuttle to the airport from the montreal train station, but barring that you can take the bus or use a service like kangaride (amigoexpress in french) as well.
1. you will probably have a connection to montreal or toronto to make
2. you can't go wrong with jesus marie. yes it's private but you are probably going to be more in line with what you had in ottawa.
3. the gym, it depends on where you stay, it's pretty much the same. personally, i had one below my desk and it was okay.
4. maybe start shopping for rentals / homes? the market is still on fire.
thank you for the comments! it assures me a lot of what everyone has written about schools in particular.
all that's left is to buy a house :)
if there are ex-ottawians it would be cool to know how it went for you
i just had an airbnb guest from germany.  shifu from quebec city to montreal and then to frankfurt.  she said the price of the connection from quebec to montreal was included in the price of the plane ticket.  
by the way, i ve flown out of quebec city a lot and it's much simpler and cheaper to fly from quebec city to montreal and then catch the connecting flight.
it's a 4 day walk
[deleted]
i believe [orléans express]( the most frequent/reliable bus service.
cheapest is definitely amigo express, it's a rideshare service.
orleans express is tge bus service, and via rail is the train one. i've rarely seen coupons for those though.
poparide is pretty cheap
orleans express (local greyhound equivalent) has special low prices if you book 2 weeks early. it is not refundable though, iirc.
otherwise you could go for amigo express (ride sharing platform), but it won't be as reliable as the bus.
i also do the mtl-quebec route quite often, feel free to pm me if that isn't too creepy.
cheapest would be hitchhiking i guess, but i'm not too sure where it would be best from montreal. bus aren't that expensive, around 60$ i think.
guaranteed round trip: orléans express (our version of greyhound)
flexible schedule: amigo express or facebook rideshare groups
rideshare used many times.  never a hassle.  more interesting than a bus.  live a little adventure it does the soul good
write on fb and see whos driving, give em $20 for gas
bicycle
bus 59$ return
train 75$ return
at the stop
allô stop closed down like 3 years ago
amigo express is called kangaride in english. it's the same service.
patente et machin / the case is ketchup / kraken cru (3 variations of the same team)
the cinderella / la planque
the neighbor on saint-joseph
gaspesian 51
rioux and pettigrew
the leaning bell tower
at boulay
the laurie-raphaël
miyagi bistro
patent and thing. le ciel (revolving restaurant). sushi box. it depends on the mood you want. there is plenty of good stock on cartier too.
santa cruz (new restaurant on de l'église), tapas and liège, clocher penché, battuto, kimono sushi are all excellent! it's not the choice that is lacking in quebec, do you have a preference in terms of cuisine?
la traite, in wendake. we go there on each of our trips to quebec, never disappointed!
the restaurant's decor is magnificent, the terrace one of the most beautiful and zen in the city, and the menu always offers fine dishes (lots of game, wild fish) that cannot be found elsewhere. in addition, their cellar is straight up.
my favorite remains le saint-amour. a chef who stands out and a cozy atmosphere perfect for a romantic dinner followed by a stroll in old quebec.
i second tapas and liège, personally it's a good place to start the evening but i often end up at a second restaurant for the main meal.
the cosmos is good too but i believe there are 2 branches now and i can only speak for one (the one on grande-allée) more i believe that the menu has changed since the covid.
la monnaguette, the restaurant at the monna cassis et filles farm is good although a limited menu (luxury snack style) but the selection of beverages (wines and cocktails) is great and as it is on a terrace facing the river, the view is amazing at night!
the sautéed rabbit is special but never disappointed the 3 times i have eaten there.
my favorite for high-priced restaurants is l'orygine or la tanière (same owners and buildings, i think).
the don is good and 100% vegan, the drinks are great there!
* la girolle, in the saint-sacrement district
* la bête, on boul. laurel
* the 47th parallel
* montenegro
* la fenouillère, near the bridges
* la cohue on 4-bourgeois
* the michelangelo
* the laurie raphaêl near the port of quebec.
sushi sakura on sainte-foy for delicious all-you-can-eat sushi, you have to book a little in advance
touareg lounge on myrand and their stuffed baguette that tastes the sky. i don't know what the restaurant looks like i just ordered delivery
the sky! it's really fun. the food is good, the prices are reasonable and the view is very cool i have been there 3 times for "special" events (2 times my party and once the start of my boyfriend's vacation) and each times, i found it very pleasant to do that there.
small hollow on cartier. corsican rest / wine bar. very nice atmosphere, excellent wines and pleasant service.
nina neapolitan pizza
i made a list on my website: d everything is there !!
la taniere: 
sacred experience!
ps: for a wedding anniversary i recommend you to choose the dining room vault
bbq biceps. a real treat!
for an event like that, heaven is the right answer. enjoy!
among other restaurants that i haven't seen named where you eat very well but it won't necessarily be the best experience:
montego, galopin, bistango, beaten, enzo sushi.
for a wedding anniversary, i recommend la traite (that would be my first choice), saint-amour, michaelangelo, initiale, lorie-raphael, fenouillère or la tanière. there is also the petit champlain in the château frontenac.
nb: i don't really have time to check that i spelled all the names correctly
these are really good addresses, i second this person 👍
i third!
i'll watch that thank you!
kimono all the way !! the surprise maki, i dream of it!
good choice! i don't know if he's still in wendake since the fire, but la sagamité is also good for forest meat. it is also in the old town near the château frontenac.
there are so many but i also liked the hobbit but only went once. and maybe not the best restaurant for a wedding anniversary, but i often suggest bonnet d'âne for a more charming / intimate meal.
yes, la girolle, a little neighborhood secret. so good!
organic bisto orygin too. patent and thing really the best quality price relaxed atmosphere, origin excellent local food atmosphere more "up" and among the best for cocktails. metropolitan, best sushi in town. échaudé, one of the hottest wine lists. la taniere, the only true gastronomic.
the surprise maki is so good that i eat it like a dessert
i would not recommend the donkey cap. it's super good and worse i like it, but it's more bistronomie, it's not full great occasions.
everyone will tell you charlevoix, it is true that it is beautiful, but in summer you will be pissed off in traffic with no chance of redemption. take the 73 instead, head north. go for a walk in stoneham for example, there is the parc sepaq de la jacques-cartier, it's there.
rivière-ouelle + kamouras
at an hour 45 each way, charlevoix is pretty ideal. what kind of activity/experience are you looking for?
the provancher marsh reserve: 
or the beach of baie saint-paul.
it depends how old your children are :)
we took a class trip to montmagny / grosse-île which was really good. we also visited the maritime museum in l'islet, and the stately manor in saint-roch-des-aulnaies. in st-jean-port-joli, there are also several art galleries; i don't know if they are open.
jacques-cartier river park or cap-tourmente. two beautiful national parks. i often go there with my children ...
did you try montmercy falls already?
kamouraska
kamouraska and baie-saint-paul, two beautiful small towns.
(i'm taking a few suggestions in passing, thanks.)
you have to spend time with the ferries, but isle-aux-grues is very pretty and not very far from quebec.
go up the south shore at the speed you want.
take the 20 to exit quebec then the 132 from beaumont. from there you can stop as often or as little as you want.
visit the flour mill in beaumont, have an organic ice cream in st-vallier, visit the marina in berthier-sur-mer (and even swim there on the beach). walk the path on the edge of the river in montmagny, the river belvedere in st-jean-port-joli. each small village has its attractions, local restaurants, and gardens. easy to quit, easy to continue and never "are we there yet !!!!".
baie st-paul or isle-aux-coudres
baie st-paul or isle-aux-coudres.
baie st-paul or isle-aux-coudres.
kamouraska smells of the sea.
this is good insider advice. thank you. my schedule is quite flexible. are there any departure days or times that work best to avoid the traffic otherwise?
apart from charlevoix, that's my vote!
> rivière-ouelle
perfect. thank you.
the kids are still pretty young, so we're not looking for long hikes or anything that would tire them too much, but other than that, we're pretty much up for anything.
thanks for the suggestions. they are 6 and 9 years old. if you think of anything else that would be fun for this age group, let me know :-)
there is also a maritime museum in les éboulements (formerly st-joseph-de-la-rive), very close to the île-aux-coudres ferry. it's a very beautiful museum, and île-aux-coudres is also worth the detour, although with the ferry and all, we may exceed the 2 hours distance.
these are great suggestions. thank you.
thanks for the suggestion. it's reassuring to hear that your children appreciate them. i will add them to the list.
yes, that was quite fun for them. that's a great suggestion, but we have already been there. we've also already gone to canyon sainte-anne, île d'orléans and valcartier is on the schedule this week. but other than that, we haven't done much else outside the city.
this has been suggested a few times. i guess i'm definitely putting this on the list. thank you for your contribution.
yeah, and it looks like they're almost across the river from each other. do you know if there is a ferry service in this area?
> you have to spend time with the ferries, but isle-aux-grues is very pretty and not very far from quebec.
thanks for the suggestion. i think the ferry ride itself would be quite entertaining for the kids. i will definitely review it.
wow. it's fantastic. thank you.
direction charlevoix, friday saturday to avoid, sunday it is in the other direction towards quebec. usually on weekends in the summer there is a traffic jam in the village of baie-st-paul. the 138 is correct on the other hand. the park of the large gardens there are also quite a few people on weekends, the week is better.
thank you. i guess i have more than one day trip to plan :-)
forget the traffic comment about charlevoix, worse case it would add 15 minutes but there's only traffic if you go there on saturday morning or come back on sunday afternoon.
if the kids feel like swimming, there's a simple lake beach in st-aimé-des-lacs, the lake is a good view. you could also take a walk around manoir richelieu, the view of the st-lawrence river and the hotel is also nice to see, similar architecture to chateau frontenac.
on the way there's laiterie charlevoix which has the best fresh cheese curds and also has things to visit if you feel like seeing how it's done with the kids.
without doing the hardest hikes, le parc des hautes gorges has some nice easy walks too if you want to see the true charlevoix nature side.
ahh! i thought they were younger than that!
if they like to cycle, the pump track at sentier-du-moulin is fun. mountain bike trails are also fun: [ (
> there is also a maritime museum in les éboulements (formerly st-joseph-de-la-rive), very close to the île-aux-coudres ferry. it's a very beautiful museum, and île-aux-coudres is also worth the detour, although with the ferry and all, we may exceed the 2 hours distance.
the two hour limit is not a hard and fast rule. the kids would love to take the ferry so that should be fine. thanks for the ideas.
i do not know, sorry. i have a two and a half year old boy, and i prefer not to do both in the same day (it would probably be done, but a little trickier). it depends on the age of your children.
the closest joins saint-siméon to rivière-du-loup. it makes a good detour.
that's what i told myself. thanks for confirming
those are terrific suggestions. thank you for taking the time to respond :-)
couldn't find a decent four bike rack this year. i guess everyone started cycling this summer. i will still keep them for next year. thank you.
this is not a problem. we have time. we might as well schedule them on different days. enjoy this moment with your son. i love this age. children grow up too fast.
> the closest connects saint-siméon to rivière-du-loup. it makes a good detour.
that's great. thank you.
a pleasure!
thank you for sharing.
the [final document] ( is super interesting.
with the relocation of the maréchaussée post, it is already ensuring that victoria park will change its vocation.
i live in the area, it's super interesting. vision 2040 meets my expectations to make it a new density hub in quebec city, as it should be for such a central district in the city today. i like that we are talking about shared alleys, 4-8 storey dwellings with mixed use condos and townhouses etc. i hope that things will change quickly anyway considering the work that is starting at place fleur de lys, and the dying commercial in the south of hamel, once zoned high density residential, i have the impression that things could move quickly with the linear park next door.
i recommend the musée de la civilisation, if there’s room! they have really fun exhibits. you’ll have more fun at the island on a non-rainy day.
le petit champlain in the old city has a lot of art galleries and cute little shops that you can visit, plus the architecture is really nice. you can also sit down for coffee over there at la maison smith. enjoy!
even tho it's a little bit far and that there is rain, you could try to visit la plage jacques cartier and cap-rouge. but i mean it's better when it's sunny...
not in the city, but if you're up for a bit of a drive north i strongly recommend stopping by le parc national de hautes gorges [
especially the trail to the acropolis (acropole-des-draveurs trail)
[
there must be hundreds of lists of things to do in quebec city on the web, you’ll have more useful results on google than on reddit.
[
otherwise you can take out a monthly pass in a nearby paid parking lot. most are managed by indigo and spaq. here are their websites.
[
[  
personally if i lived in the old town i would prefer to use public transport / bicycle and communauto for my occasional needs. probably more economical and less of a headache.

do you think you need the car very often? i worked without a car in limoilou for about 3 years, i rented a car from discount when i needed it. what is expensive with car rental is insurance, but most credit cards offer this insurance if you rent it.
in addition, it allowed us to try several types of car, we knew what we wanted after having tried so many!
hey! welcome to quebec city, i also just moved here and am right next to the ramparts.
i ended up getting an underground spot at city hall (hotel de ville) for ~170$. it's a short jaunt up sainte famille for me but anytime i need to bring something big home i just park in front of my place with the hazards on and leave enough space for another car to pass (and it seems that's what my neighbors also do)
nice people *
thank you for your help dear stranger 😊😊
phew, this is ugly situation. you share a lot of relevant information anyway.
it is very complete! thank you for your feedback 😊
i'm going to think about that ... it's true that in the end i don't need it in everyday life 😊😊
what might make sense is that they just put hochelaga and bay leaf end to end
yes, there will be an announcement, it's the next big mtq project for quebec city.
since the tunnel project office has zero control over the bridgehead, they have completely excluded it. in terms of project management, that makes sense.
there doesn't seem to be any plans for laurier on this, but it's just a plot placed over a current map.
looks like the graphic designer just cut and paste the laurier / duplessis curve.
it is not rather the saint-louis road? it looks like the route to the right of your arrow would be on chemin saint-louis instead of grande-allée or rene-levesque (i seem to recognize the end where chemin saint-louis meets grande-allée on the right).
possible but currently, you have to take lavigerie to reach hochelaga from laurier (the two are therefore not end-to-end in a straight line like that). in addition, the route to the west presents an arched section to reach pius-xii, which does not currently exist either.
it is rather the junction of rene levesque and laurier i believe at the right end
ouo indeed, i went to see and it is this intersection on the right. it must be continuity between laurier and duplessis at the interchange.
yes, that's right, boulevard laurier does not currently cross duplessis (it is rather boulevard hochelaga that does this). afterwards it looks like the path gradually bends to join pie-xii, once again an element that does not currently exist (pie-xii and boulevard neilson intersect at right angles). it is possible that this is only to simplify the presentation or an artistic choice ... i still find it surprising considering that the other major arteries are not modified in this way.
no. neighborhood councils have virtually no power. some municipal parties (ie not équipe labeaume) would like that to change (but perhaps not to allow them to issue fines).
the city website isn't very easy to navigate. [here]( is a page found under arrondissements that might help. or [this]( one has info about tickets.
thank you!!
thanks!
a mesangeai from canada?
a red-breasted nuthatch?
i have a friend who shows up with him, he is as empty as it seems.
bruno marchand has a good head and that's it.
extreme centrism! okay with that.
aye let's calm down clickbait titles lol he's a candidate for mayor as we've seen hundreds of them over the years and around the world.
a small neighborhood politician who wants to "change things", but without great skills or ideas.
he won't be elected, so don't panic! so make hit pieces on quebec 21 if the tram and the lack of a third link are important to you, it is more likely to win, the leader was already on the municipal council, and he is firmly against the common good, rather than ambivalent.
i had a very favorable prejudice at the start considering his role at centraide and he disappointed me royally. there are low-level managers with more clarity of ideas, more vision, more conviction. no idea how he got there, or at least it doesn't appear at all.
he presents himself well, handsome man, able to say the right clips at the right time. it reminds me of our prime minister. empty.
yes, but he skates with great charisma.

ahahahah indeed. in extremis cursed.
but my point remains, qc21 had 4 councilors elected, it is much more dangerous for the good of the city than a beige mayor.
hey. don’t be sorry first of all. you will spend time and money in our city. i guess that requires at least a warm welcome and hope she says yes! 
as for your help needed:
1) there are tons of cafés, good places to eat. i’m sure you can use your phone and google reviews while you’re here. a few in mind: cochon dingue, cote a cote, lapin sauté, mato. downtown i love going to l’affaire est ketchup, deux22 and many other great places. 
2) while it would be tempting to ask her on terrasse dufferin (just besides your hôtel), it’s a bit cliche and full of tourists all year around. still, it’s a beautiful spot. there are a few and good looking streets not that far from the fairmont. i’d suggest maybe place royale, parc cavalier-du-moulin, porte st-louis or prescott, parc montmorency. maybe a good photographer could help with a perfect location for you to ask. 
3) i’m no photographer but i work in the video and post-production industry. i suggest you go to facebook and type gang des pigistes. it’s a group of freelancers. there’s a ton of em. i’m sure you will find a good fit with someone. 
4) i don’t know about kingston weather but in this city, it can be very cold and windy during november. bring some warm clothes just in case. don’t forget your proof of vaccination, you will need it to enter any restaurant or café. you won’t need to learn french but a few basic words wouldn’t hurt either during your stay. we love people trying! (plus you can surprise your future fiancee). 
have fun, enjoy your visit and have a wonderful time with her!
i am planning a proposal too sometime when i visit in nov 14-17 near le chateau fairmont so this is amazing to see on reddit! thank you for the post and hope all goes well.
hey i’m a photographer in qc. msg me :)
you are amazing thank you so so so much. you made my day. this is very helpful!!
thank you! you too!
thanks for the reply! i actually just secured someone today, however others who read the post with the same idea will maybe reach out! thanks!
i believe beurredepeanut sums it all. november is between season, it will be much less crowded and the weather can be difficult to predict. that said, and from a fellow canadian to another, you know all of this :)   this is a parallel conversation in the sub on a 4-day trip that could inspire some activities. i think you are participating in another discussion on food. please feel free to ask any questions you have. and la tanière, you can't go wrong with that one.
place royale at night (and at night, it could be 8 pm ;) ) could be a great place to pop the question. it may sound weird, but try google streetview.
if you could not find any help with la gang de pigistes, let us know. we won't let you down. or let fairmount help you, they might have a better idea.
edit: i believe the skating ring will be opened on place d'youville at that time, with the possibility to rent skates there. 
yeah! i'm in contact with them.   
thanks anyway and have a great time in the city.  
 you're going to love it   
if you need any recommendations let me know!
there is a hair salon in the desjardins pavilion at laval university. it's great near residences, so i guess their employees are more likely to have seen a greater diversity of hair types.
good luck :)
i would have thought that asian hair is like european hair i go to the temple on langelier there is a barber of asian origin but with a quebec accent so i imagine that there is no specific knowledge of asian hair in his practice. my barber is latino and i have fine hair, it's a bit long but he does such a great job
the hairdressers and hairdresser at lee love are good. you can call ahead to make sure they can help you
thanks for sharing! i find the campaign very interesting to date. i couldn't listen to the debate, other opinions of editors who took a look?
do you have a linkedin account? i have a dec in info and 7 years of experience and i have been receiving 2-5 messages per week for 3 months
look for recruiters on linkedin. it'll take you 7 seconds and they'll connect you with 32 jobs.
no sign of exclusivity. the market is in your favor.
levio, fujitsu, cgi, and government contests. these are the biggest, easy to find a first experience and go where you want afterwards.
randstad is ok. no matter who you do business with, remember to be critical and trust your judgment. these companies are often paid according to the number of candidates they hire ...
also, are you familiar with the indeed.ca site / app?
if you send me your linkedin i could put you in touch with the recruiters where i work. it's a quebec it company!
hello ! i sent you a private message, my box is recruiting a lot at the moment;)
caa-quebec, we're looking for people!
try gft group
i have a linkedin, but i'm not active in the sense that i don't post and don't have a lot of connections.
thanks for the comment and the information.
when we say look for recruiters on linkedin, how do we do that?
thanks for the comment and the information.
i am aware of [indeed.ca] ( i have registered my cv there and activated to be public. i received a few messages from recruiters.
sent!
no need to publish, enter all your information in your profile and activate the option "i am looking for a job" and recruiters will stop.
there is a search bar.
seriously there are tons of head hunters on linkedin. find a couple and ask them if they have any roles to fill.
if you are looking for a local job, find recruiters in your area.
this
if you want an apartment for a short period of time i suggest you look at this  or  the real estate managers will make a contract (lease) where most of the time you have to stay 1 year, or until next july 1. this contract there (lease) you cannot terminate it, if you decide to leave the apartment you must pass it to another person, or pay until the final date.
several real estate management agencies have a large selection of apartments such as logisco and lafrance & mathieu. finding a furnished place as a 3v summit will really make learning about the city easier 👌
you can look on centris sometimes there is housing for rent and everything! i hope its gonna help you! 😊
kijiji
also, on fb there is a group for lease assignments in quebec.
thanks for the help!
if i enter a contract, will i be caught until july 1, 2022?
thanks for the help!
hello, what's the name of the band? thank you!
normally the leases last 1 year. but it is possible to find “short-term” leases. or sometimes leasebacks. that is, people who will move out before the end of their lease. so you would only pay for a few months.
sorry for the "transfer of lease quebec" delay
thank you, friend
i sympathize! i have long been in the same situation. i find it really deplorable that this is happening for so many people and buildings.
legally, it sure takes your permission to do that ... but as you transition to zero waste, i imagine you don't have such a large amount of salvage either, so it's not like you're bringing in a big blue bin on wheels at the neighbor's house. personally, i dragged my recovery to university for a long time: i went there often and there were recycling bins everywhere (and often better sorted than just putting everything in the blue bin).
and if you ever ask your neighbor and he refuses, i would be very surprised if he also refuses your $ 5 / month offer!
good luck <3
not true?! just out of curiosity, what are the reasons given by the co-ownership to justify such a lack? knowing that the bins are offered free of charge by the city ... thank you in any case for not having chosen the easy solution and throwing everything in the trash, it's heartwarming \ ^ \ ^
otherwise in my street (montcalm district), we just leave the blues bags outside on pickup days. maybe you can check if there won't be a street not far from where you are allowed to do the same?
good luck!

"there is no way to ensure that the materials sent to sorting centers will actually be recycled once sold abroad"
that says a lot. ideologically i have nothing against recycling but in fact, it's not exactly pink as a process. that said, your baccalaureate availability problem seems to be considered if i trust the article in le soleil.
40% of recycling goes to the trash; let that sink in.
we didn't have any before last year here. big boulder in ste foy. i had one in my apartment and had sympathized with a neighbor to put it with his
i find that sincerely awful. when i called the building concierge, he laughed in my face and said to just put everything in the trash. i was horrified. we took my rubbish back to my father.
i suspect it takes her.
even before my (official) transition, i was releasing 5 liters of recycling every two to three weeks. and the university option is also being considered.
the owner next door is a big property manager (i'm between blocks) so it could be problematic for my agreement
i am not op but the excuse of my former building manager was "the guys from the receipt don't come by when necessary / don't pick up like a crowd / the bins are in the way / that would be too complicated / y'a not enough people recovering ”. clearly, it was a poorly disguised "i damn".
in absolute terms, i am fully aware that there is no guarantee that my recycling is really recycled. hence why i produce very little of it - the biggest i produce is metal (because my garden doesn't produce enough for me to be able to produce enough cane for a year). but the little cardboard that i recycle, i want it to have a chance. so i'm looking for a solution for this year (not somewhere in 2022) as the article points out
thank you so much. i am aware that a lot does not recycle. but i clean my stock and i do a good quality sorting. telling me that a lot of the recycling goes to the dump at the end does not solve my problem.
without necessarily asking the *** owner ***, maybe you can ask the janitor / building manager. if you show an example of what you can bring per week, you might have more chances!
the world in quebec is losing too much of recycling; the problem is that 80% of the rest of the planet does not care and moreover pollutes a billion times more than we do. see china, india etc.
you’ll be completely fine visiting here and speaking only english, especially if it’s for such a short visit. attempting to speak french rather than only speaking english to the citizens will go a long way. you can ask “parlez-vous anglais?” if your french is that bad. if you begin to speak french and they notice your accent, chances are they will switch to english provided they can speak it. if you stick to the tourist areas, you may even hear more english spoken than french. enjoy your trip!
your two days are pretty loaded. but in case you have time, 
and also
the musée is located on the plaines of abraham near montcalm wich is a less touristy neighborhood with some shops where locals go. enjoy your staying!
depending on how light you travel (backpack), consider getting a monthly membership to àvélo: [
...even for a few days and with only ten stations, it's worth it to extend your range in the city if only you take 10 trips or more. try visiting all ten stations. since they're electric, they make it easy to go uphill to the upper town and there's a station right next to via rail at gare du palais.
quebec city is way more french than montreal but you shouldn’t be worried about speaking english at all. personally, i’m always happy when people practice their french with me and i switch languages if they need to understand me better ! 
i always suggest taking a walk on the plains of abraham, you get a beautiful view of the st. lawrence river from up there. if you like art, right now there’s a picasso exhibition at musée des beaux arts, but there is also a [free circuit called les passages insolites]( with public art on display in the streets. 
for coffee shops, i recommend checking out la maison smith. i also love paillard (on st. jean street), they have amazing sandwiches and pastries ! i hope you’ll have fun, enjoy your stay ! 😊
when you will go to the montmorency waterfall, please take the path "les résurgences" upstream. it's a beautiful hike that is way less crowdy and the scenery is just beautiful. you can take it when you are on the top of the waterfall, just across the avenue royale, you can't miss it.
there's an excellent bakery called ''royaume de la tarte'' near downtown, my personnal favorite is the popcorn cake! here's the address should you want to visit : 553 boulevard charest ouest, [
if you like beer there is a microbrasserie (local beer) store on cartier av. in montcalm, [
of course you should also try some of the coffees/pubs on st-jean street. have a pleasant stay !
try to speak as much french as you can. most often since you are in touristy areas they will here your accent and respond back in english. but you just might get some responses back in french. push your self to practice. soon enough you’ll be gone and then the only way for you to practice will be through conversation groups. so take advantage of it.
i love the farmers market. a sunset on the balcony by chateau frontenac would be nice. the ursaline museum was great. i’d say look on trip advisor and book yourself a walking tour. it’s a small city with a lot of history in it. maybe do that in the beginning and then you can explore tips from the guide later on.
hi! 
you should plan your visits around 4 areas that have very different « moods » and that can be walked easily if you are in good shape: st-roch (downtowb area, more hipster style), vieux-port (art galeries, tourists shops. it’s litteraly at the feet of the chateau frontenac. the best place to get a drink is there: la cours arrière du festibiere. look it up!) vieux-quebec (don’t hesitate to go in the « faubourg » part that is more on the west side of « rue st-jean »! lot of great places! l’épicerie européenne serves really nice sanswiches for a small price. a nice plan for lunch!) finally, you can continue to montcalm, principally for the rue cartier, but also to wander in the plaindes d’abraham near the musée national des beaix arts. it’s really a beautifull place! 
don’t hesitate to pm me if you have any question!
my advice is fall in love with quebec like i did and come back and live in this fascinating city and fall in love with the culture and the language.
i moved from whistler bc ex of vancouver to quebec in 1988 and i'm still in the province but in montreal
this is the best advice. was looking for it! i adore these bikes. such a convenient and fun way to get around downtown.
i also have to say, my french is pretty good!
the facebook groups anglophones living in quebec city and english speakers in quebec city have solid communities—in the before times, people would occasionally get together for drinks or activities. they’re also a great resource for navigating the bureaucracy and finding bilingual service providers.
the voice of english-speaking québec (veq) also tries to do fun activities specifically for newcomers. they’ve done everything from potlucks to river cruises to group water park outings. again, it’s slowed down because of the pandemic, but you can keep an eye on their social media. they crosspost to the other 2 facebook groups i mentioned, too. 
as for meeting people “in the wild,” i’d say it’s pretty standard as long as you at least make an effort to speak french. if you put yourself out there, join groups/classes that interest you, and are generally friendly, you’ll probably find friends.
it shouldn't be too difficult, we're a social bunch. as for the "how", it depends what you like to do for fun, but there's plenty of ways that meet people.
if you need a resource, dm me! i lived in waterloo for a while too, so i know both worlds and will gladly help you.
can you speak any french? that would help tremendously. if not, you could try meeting people through the voice of english speaking quebec. ( if you’re into the club/party scene it isn’t hard to meet people at the various clubs and bars along grande allée e. depending on your job you may be able to make friends through it. if you haven’t learned french yet, you could try taking a course somewhere like u laval or the centre du phénix in sainte-foy. i’ve made friends through courses at the latter.
as you say speak french, i answer you in french.
the easiest way is to find activities that appeal to you and chat with the people you meet there. what are your favorite hobbies and activities?
it shouldn't be too difficult, we're a social bunch. as for the "how", it depends what you like to do for fun, but there's plenty of ways that meet people.
if you need a resource, dm me! i lived in waterloo for a while too, so i know both worlds and will gladly help you.
the anglophones page, for sure. i know they've done some hikes recently.
i joined the local gaelic football club. a good social community,  a good mix of men and women, and great cardio.
it all depends on what you like as other people said. veq is a great start, but since you speak french, you should also try to meet people outside the english-speaking community. the anglophone community in quebec is pretty small, and you'll definitely will live in a bubble and miss out on a lot of stuff. i dmed some info!
good, but wait ...
donkeydick?
let me tell you people you meet in bars on grand allé sometimes aren’t the best people around. depending on your style ofc. if you like to party go for it, there’s a lot of english speakers too.
yes my french is pretty good (will be speaking french at work 24/7)
i really enjoy walking in the forests, going to social parties, playing the guitar (and going to concerts)
hahaha
sorry, it's a bit of a throwaway account from a few years ago
there are walking clubs, you can find them on facebook. there is a lot of nature around quebec, we are pampered!
for the social, without activity in particular, it is more difficult. you can always go to bars. otherwise, what could be good are language meetings: you can either practice your french or help french speakers (and allophones) practice their english. you can search for barden quebec city or quebec meetup multilingual on facebook.
saint-joseph street is the best spot although the pandemic killed a few good venues and the construction sites kill the vibe a bit.
saint-jean street is also good for pubs but try to stay outside the walls since the venues inside tend to obscenely jack up the prices for no reason other than exploit the tourists (understandably).
on saint jean there’s the drague which another user recommended. it’s a gay club but it’s still a fun and busy environment.
grande-allee used to be the spot but people say it has lost its mojo. that was true for the last few years but recently there have been good new venues opening up and old ones rejuvenating themselves so it’s slowly but surely getting back on track to its former glory days. it’s just that it switched from nightclub vibe to pub vibe.
there’s close to nothing resembling a night club in quebec. one user here suggested district but probably hasn’t gone out in a while since that place has been closed since the beginning of the pandemic and never reopened.
3eme avenue in limoilou has good pubs as well.
saint-vallier street (basically an extension of saint-joseph) has great small venues popular with the locals. 
just a few hints: people of quebec do speak a good amount of english, especially young people, but it’s nowhere near like in montreal. try to remain patient and understanding. 
also i worked the bar industry for more than a decade and just like my fellow industry peers, i have learned to become warry of a group of anglos. too often have we been treated like some poorman’s las vegas or amsterdam redlight district for ontarians and americans from northern states. just remain decent and it should be fine.
tons of pubs and micro breweries. other than that, the nightclub scene is totally dead here. dagobert is pretty much the only nightclub left
[deleted]
depends on your notion of busy nightclubs, if you're looking for a place where most tables and spaces are full and people are dancing close to each other, there never was such thing even before the pandemic lmao. i'm latino and even on pride night, halloween, and fin des cours, it was just "some people". the only ones that get busy ish were shaker and le drague. i actually advise you and your friends to enjoy the nature and history side of qc city instead. the waterfalls, the citadelle, they are really beautiful spots to take pictures. have a big poutine at the spot of your preference (not wanting to start a riot here). have a beer at la korrigane.
dredge, district
first one is an lgbt place big probably the biggest club in the area. 
there's also the délice in lévis which is the classiest one but it's across the river
le phoenix, is that what replaced le boudoir?
i guess you are too young to have known le monkey, le star bar, le palladium and le maurice.
[deleted]
levis 🤢🤮
and the palace.
wow the monkey, it's been so long xd
the mundial with its “triple your cash” deals
as i mentioned, that depends on what notion you have of busy. i went to many many bars while i lived there, and still i didn't find it busy. for me, busy is you cannot move an inch without some other body in your way. when my born and raised qc friends came to my home city, many found the night scene too suffocating, even if for us was normal so i understand perfectly if you consider it pretty big. maybe even op finds it very big, who knows.
where do you recommend going then?
lévis has the best view of québec at least :p
based and northshorepilled
i lived in quebec city for a couple months and explored lévis quite a bit (only the side accessible by ferry) and really liked it.  it’s a totally different place and the architecture is really cool
sooooo many big nights at the monkey.
holy shit that takes me back
someone asks for an opinion on quebec city on the quebec city sub and it offers a ~~ bar ~~ pizzeria in the dormitory town on the other side of the river lol.
lévis is part of the city of quebec according to the definition of this sub. rivalry accepted, even i approve of it, i love the term northshorepilled, but let's stay civil!
how was i not a civilian?
i didn't say you weren't, i just want to prevent it from veering in that direction! : p
as far as i know, the city of lévis had its own subreddit some time ago, then the subreddits from both shores were merged to form r / quebeccity. it's largely a tourist subreddit, and it would be awkward to say that tourism is strong in lévis. we can therefore include lévis in this subreddit without too many consequences.
in fact, it was a sub for the entire region in french and one for quebec in english (read for tourists) that were merged.
i agree with you on the insignificance of lévis
hi! what sector are you in, what level?
we have a mixed league that plays in the winter there may be room but let's say that if you are on the north shore it could be far.
otherwise, register on [ there are a few league that uses their services and you will receive requests of substitution
thank you for the answer! i am in ste-foy. i can move. it's not a problem. i have been playing recreationally all my life. i'm doing well i would say.
you can watch the distance, we're playing at the sainte-claire arena south of lévis. it's still a good tip but if you are interested leave me a pm, i will let you know if they are lacking in regularity otherwise i will add you to the replacement.
it's a mixed league and it's really friendly, no big head everyone is there to have fun, it's important
it's just day 1
people have been told to work at home as much as possible for 2 weeks!
employers have rented hotel rooms to their employees, to avoid delays or shortages of staff.
the majority of goods transport will be done at night!
schools are closing!
it seemed to me that this was the ultimate proof of the need for a 3rd link? rather, it seems to me that it demonstrates the induced demand in a remarkable way, and its converse which is just as true: when we remove roads, we reduce traffic.
check bin, tomorrow morning everyone is going to say "oh really, it's okay" and the traffic will resume
yup, the majority of the work was scheduled for a period when it is less busy. it is normal to have this observation at a time when it is less busy.
edit: third link or not, the comparison is bad.
day 2, same case. i'm starting to sound crazy for not going to work at the office.
it's proven by real planners, less road = less congestion. there are just concrete fanatics who believe that adding lanes reduces traffic jams.
big yikes. it's funny how forcing companies to better arrange their affairs can regulate traffic in such a simple way.
quite sure that it costs less for the two cities to make logistical changes like that than to lay a third bridge or dig a tunnel.
i saw an empty bus in the afternoon. it shows in a remarkable way that public transport is inefficient in terms of energy.
to strike a roughly similar balance to before work towards the end of the week.
these are theories known to urban planners and transport specialists.
precisely if everyone is saying that to themselves, it will not be nice tentot! : p
you will tell that to my boss
we get food.
best is to chew it before swallowing.
but with ice cream, you can swallow directly.
pain could be harsh.
i just tried some delicious neopolitan style pizza at pizzeria no.900 last night. recommend!
i'm not from the city but last i visited i went to this gastro pub called le projet. had cool beers and good food if that's your jam.
lots of really good restaurants on saint-joseph
lool thanks guys but i think what i'm asking is what is your top 3 fave places to eat in quebec city
sushi taxi, if you want good and unique sushi. their "shogun" selection is usually excellent.
pierrot pizza (garnished).
all gelato ice cream.
asking that about quebec city is the same as asking that for new-york city. (at a smaller scale of course)
for steak and tartare - la bete or le charcoal
for pizza/poutine - pizzeria paquet. not exactly in quebec city but close enough and really worth it.
sushi - sushi x
sandwich - chez victor
ice cream - favorite chocolate
best places for sushis:
enzo $$$
kimono $$
tokyo $
we could give you food options for a month. just a weekend is not enough.
hey thank you so much for your replies, but honestly where are all the black ppl hanging out at in quebec city?
eat some chinese paté.
le bureau de poste is also really good.
in all sorts of variety...
it’s good but nina pizza is better for me ;)
* [ciel]( to have a nice view and the food is pretty good
* [nina]( for great pizza
* [tora-ya ramen] ( for ramens (duh)
* [la bête]( if you want steak
* [la salsa]( for salvadorian food
* [chez boulay] ( [le clocher inclined] ( or [le pied bleu] ( if you're feeling fancy
* [elli] ( for a brown drag
* [le don]( for vegan food
* [the antique dealer buffet] ( for brunch
* [snackbar st-jean]( for a poutine
everyone have their preferences, here are some of mine:
\- if you want a sandwich, i recomend chez victor, they have some pretty good options and there are several around the city.
\- if you just want some quick trash-food, i like to get the double-bacon-bbq burger with a bébé poutine (the smalest one) and a soda at ashton.
\- for pizzas i like the nina pizza napolitaine, but now i have to try this pierrot pizza other people are talking about! ;-)
\- if you want to have a brunch i like the kalimera. or if you are into fancy places, le ciel where you will also have a very good view of the city.
\- if you want a good steak, try it at batton rouge.
\- for poutine i like the poutine au canard at cochon dingue, but i want to try it at gaston and also at pierrot.
otherwise there are many good restaurants at vieux québec.
pierrot has the best poutine in quebec city
> pierrot pizza (garnished)
pierrot snack?
... sooo what you got?
people dont really group themselves by race here... we're all québécois compatriots
agreed, but feel like you can't go wrong with either option!
we have a place that does drag bunch?!?! this is news to me. very exciting news.
la salsa is actually salvadorian. pupusas are a typical dish from el salvador, and they are exquisite!
how does it measure against a gaston ?
will have to try that too. is there a type of poutine that's best?
anything else they do well?
by all rights, that place looks like a rundown diner but it's great.
yes.
1028 restaurants.
add emporium to that list of exceptional italian pizzerias in quebec city!
le drague opened that recently-ish? maybe last year?
yes you're right, i forgot! thank you! :-d
for poutine, it really depends on your personal tastes.  me, i like it with spaghetti sauce, it's called italian.  very meaty.  the classic one is also very good.  
also, the best restaurants are  unassuming.  
by the way, tutto gelato is the best ice cream i've ever tasted.  and i had gelato in italy
lol thnx ur a great help hope you enjoyed all 1028 of em
my god, i live just a few blocks away and have never tried it! i know where i'm getting my next pizza. merci. :)
le drague has been around for years :-p
"meaty" is how i heard a tourist describe pierrot's pizza. 
i'll have to try both the italian and classic poutines, thanks. 
the world deserves pierrot franchises though.
it opened barely a year before the pandemic (in 2019), and it's a microbrewery first, so they don't advertise their amazing pizza skills enough. it may be a good thing, though, because if they did, the place would be packed day in and day out!
yes, but the drague opened the restaurant with the drag brunch recently, that's what i said.
whatever you do, don't have the large poutine.  it's pretty big.  my girlfriend and i had a hard time finishing it
visiting old quebec, arround chateau frontenac and les plaines d'abraham for hisorical insights about the province could be done by foot, you can have some queues de castor and eat them just in front of the castle overseeing the st laurent.
l'ile d'orléans is also a nice place with beautiful villages and acces to the saint laurent at some places.
i can't forget la chute montmorency which is really impressive and not that far.
if you have a car, you can do hiking in parc de la jacques cartier, the trails i would recommend is les loups, but be careful, its not an easy trail, but you get amazing views of the valley.
have a nice stay
l'aquarium de québec is a must do to me, especially with a family.
as others said, old quebec, l'aquarium, and either the montmorency chute or the chute-de-la-chaudiere on the other side of the bridge.
a nice walk is along the st-lawrence river, along the champlain boulevard. or on the other side of the bridge the jacques-cartier park. 
the civilization museum is really adapted for family, can't recommand it enough. 
you can also go to the valcartier water park, i really recommand it for kids and adults. you must have a reservation because of covid restriction since they are at 35% capacity. it's from the same people than the bora park around ottawa.
how old the kids?
if they're young, between 4 and 10, the *musée de la civilisation* has a permanent section for kids with fairy tales costumes and accessories, plus a mirror room. there are usually activities linked to their exhibitions too for kids slightly older (maybe 6-14). all of that on the basement floor. their exhibitions, both permanent and temporary, are also very interesting, at least for teenagers and up.
if they are teenagers, look up the ghost tours of the city. it's a guided tour at dusk that visits all the crime stories and shady things that happened in quebec city.
here is a copy of a comment i made on another thread, as you know most everything is re-opening right now so double-check beforehand! it's the general tourist version of a city guide, if i knew more about you i could be more precise, for example there are many micro-breweries that are worth a visit, or stuff for kids, or hiking spots, etc.
so for a start, the chateau frontenac on terasse dufferin is the most photographed hotel in the world its quite impressive to see, from there go down to quartier petit champlain, in the winter when the snow is falling it's truly magical. from down there you can take the ferry to lévis, where you will have the best view of québec city, they also have a nice old town and a history of their own. back in québec, the citadelle is a multiple century old military fort, there is a museum in there you can visit. the plains of abraham is a important site in the history of canada, where a big (but quick) battle was fought between the english and the french. the parliament is near that, you can also visit it, the architecture is beautiful. grande-allée, is a nice busy street to walk on, there is a rotating restaurant on top of the concorde hotel. for another good view, look for the city's observatory, its on top of the tallest building. not too far is the modern art museum witch is built into an old prison its quite interesting. if you are into spooky stuff, there are ghost tours of the city as well, google it. the rue st-jean is one of the most popular street, its a quaint shopping district. when you see the hotel-dieu, the oldest hospital in north america (there's a museum) you can go down to the lower city where you will find rue st-joseph. the lower city is way less tourist-y, there's a good selection of boutiques (see benjo for the kids!) and not too pricey restaurants. to the west of the core city area, the aquarium is pretty cool, there is a very nice park outside with a beautiful view of the bridges and the river. to the east is the ile d'orléans, take the ring road, its a country experience right next to the city there is a buch of farms you can visit. it's also right by the montmorency falls which are also quite impressive, there is a park there and a kind of ski lift with an amazing view. if the remparts (the city's junior hockey team) are playing at the videotron center, take a look! the arena is still brand new and nhl ready, the ambiance is always electrifying. there is a shoping center called les galleries de la capitale a little outside the city, with an indoor amusement park, ice skating area and fancy food market, its quite impressive. if you're willing to go a bit out of the city (20min by car), check out the village vacance valcartier, its a huge winter amusement park with massive slides and indoor water-park, tons of fun! oh! n'oubliez pas d'essayer la poutine! chez gaston on rue dorchester will give you the best potato shack poutine experience and its open very late, poutineville on rue saint-joseph is fancyer and more of a restaurant experience, they have more variety (but pretty much anywhere you go you will find poutine!)
i would say avoid eating and shopping in the old city, it's very good, but also super touristy and you will pay the price. other than that anything in the tourism guide (www.quebec-cite.com/en/) is worthwhile i would say, it depends on what you enjoy personally. one last thing, people here can easily switch to english, especially in the old quebec and other tourist spots, but we all appreciate someone making the effort to start with what little french they know, even if its only "bonjour!" and "merci!". as an isolated island of french culture in north america, we are quite proud of our roots!
i hope you and the kids have a wonderful time!
* old quebec
* museum of civilization
* museum of fine arts
* quebec aquarium
* jacques cartier park
* montmorency falls
* fall of the boiler
* mont wright 
i would argue that the chute de la chaudière is a lot more impressive and less touristy then montmorency. you can walk down close to the falls and even picnic there.
if you like hiking, mont wright and the parc de la jacques cartier are awesome places.
wow gang - thanks sooo much for all the amazing suggestions.  my little guy is 8 - so after googling these ideas a bit - they are perfect!  i am going to have to adjust my itinerary and stay longer :)  
truly appreciate you all taking the time to share with some out of towners!
go visit old québec, its worth a day of visit.
take the ferry to lévis, to admire québec from there and also to visit.
i like musée de la civilisation, theres a permanent exposition on native americans, on the history and life of québécois and also many cool temporary expositions,. notably one about the maya people. 
then go visit île d'orléans for a rural beautiful island near québec city. lots of farms and cute villages.
you can visit chutes montmorency which are impressive waterfall with a suspended bridge.
you can go to baie de beauport for a sandbeach....but this is not florida ;)
all the people here have tons of nice idea. the only thing missing is the cap tourmente national park (federal). really nice hikes even for children and a beautiful landscape. the ride to go there is beautiful.
with a 8 year old kid, you must go to les galleries de la capitale, this is a shopping malls with an attraction park this is perfect for a rainy day. if you want an other activity for your kid you can also visit la vallée secrete, this is a place where the forest hide some elfs that you must found (funny, did it last year with my 7). and like other redditers said: village vacance val-cartier, parc de la jacques cartier, parc duschenay, les tours du vieux-québec, l’île d’orlean (you should do the tour: about 60km but there’s a lot of things to visit…plan a day)
enjoy your trip!
check if l'observatoire de la capitale is re-opened a couple days before coming. it has a very good view of the citadele (witch is also great) :
[
[
in front of the musée de la civilisation there's a multi-level parking lot that has a pretty good view of the old city. you don't need to park there if you don't want to, you can take the elevators and the stairs to the top levell. next to the parking lot it's the place des canotiers, where you can enjoy the water fontains with your kid if it's a hot day (and they have toilets if you someone is in need).
depending on the dates, a good activity can be collecting fruits (blueberries, strawberries, apples). 
something i like to do also is taking the ferry from quebec to levis. i think it’s 3 or 4$ and you have a very beautiful view. both sides have water play. there is a big wheel on levis side and a “chocolat favoris” food truck (very popular ice cream with chocolate).
parc maizerets can also be an option outside touristic areas. it’s a beautiful big urban park with playground, natural habitats, there is a labyrinth and water plays also. 
if you have a car you could also rent pedalo at the marina de cap-rouge, which is outside touristic areas but still have very beautiful views
take the ferry across the river, its not expensive and you get the best view on the city. there is plenty of stuff to see also on the ferry's landing at levis.
ile d'orléans;
"la roulotte du coin" has an incredible duck confit poutine, a must have!
"chez mag" is also very good for poutines and fast-but-good food.
the walking around old quebec part is really i think the highlight. just make sure you don't book yourself too tight and leave time to just explore. it's a relatively big area on foot and of course you don't have to go everywhere, but you want to have time to breath and just look around, go into all kinds of little shops, etc.
make sure you go into the lower part: quartier champlain and the upper part on terrasse dufferin and walk on rue st-jean and around place d'youville.
as a resident here, walking around these parts once or twice a year is always fun.
calypso \ * bora parc is "part" of the village vacances valcartier.
the section for kids at musée de la civilisation is closed now unfortunately... that section has been closed for the better part of the past year.
edit: i just wanted to add that if your kids love museums, they will still have a blast even without that section
i always wanted to go a la roulotte du coin ! thanks for the reminder ;)
it's true! i was mixed up, thank you !!!
+1 for village vacances valcartier.
what is * r4r *?
it stands for redditor for redditor.
it is for those who are looking for someone in their city / neighborhood to chat, chat, meet and maybe also hang out.
for some it's purely sexual while for others it's to make new friends in the area.
ah! thank you!
it's crazy how the highway cuts the neighborhood and really makes it unpleasant to walk around other than by car.
i live in old limoilou and expo-cité is a 15/20 min walk away but psychologically it's so far away, it really doesn't make you want to walk in traffic.
- taxes and insurance for the house (municipal taxes etc)
if you rent municipal taxes are paid by your landlord. for an average house that you own, allow $ 2000-3000 / year (including school taxes).
for home insurance allow between $ 200-400 / year depending on the amount of goods insured.
- house bills (heating, etc.)
between $ 100 and $ 200 / month heating and electricity. and $ 50- $ 100 / month internet.
- cell phone costs
dear. around $ 60 / month
- taxes and insurance for the car
depending on the car and your driving experience, between $ 700 and $ 1,500 / year
for the car taxes they are only applicable to the purchase, but there are the saaq registration fees of approximately $ 275-300 / year and the license $ 95 / year per person.
- food
for two people between $ 100 and $ 150 / week depending on the channels.
it's easier to find a summer seasonal job i would say. work in a natural park, horticulture for example.
i cannot answer you on all points, not having a house for example.
expect much higher bills than in europe for cell phone and internet charges, depending on your usage.
compared to france, my feeling is that the electricity bills are cheaper, i don't know if an owner pays for the access to water, but in my case (in an apartment) the heating and water are included in my rent, i therefore only pay for the electricity and necessarily without the heating, it doesn't cost much.
for the rest i don't want to talk nonsense so i will abstain.
* taxes and insurance for the house (municipal taxes etc)
* $ 200-250 / month
* house bills (heating, etc.)
* $ 100 / month (if you put it on the year, it's more expensive in winter)
* cell phone charges
* $ 50-80 / month (cell)
* $ 50 / month (average internet)
* taxes and insurance for the car
* $ 60 / month for insurance (approximately)
* the price of gasoline and the payment of the car will vary
* food
* fairly variable, i would say $ 400 / month
for employment, the market is quite different in times of pandemic, but normally it is quite easy to find a job. as for the salary, on the other hand, it is more difficult for a "basic" job.
i would say that in your case, you will be better off renting an apartment for the first few years and not buying (i don't know your financial situation).
payments are going to be very different in this case.
very good overview. i will add that the taxes are also going to vary really a lot depending on the location, so i would say average house in an average neighborhood. i also find your estimate for groceries a bit low, but it really depends on their habits. i would have said more like $ 100-200 per week.
i would tell op to be careful about wanting the butter and the money from the butter. houses are very expensive right now in the city and it will be good to be careful of a situation where a couple with seasonal jobs, who own a house and a car, do not find themselves in a precarious situation. maybe op will prefer to move away from the city to have easier access to this reality. in addition, beware of extremely low mortgage rates, which artificially increase purchasing power.
sorry for the disgusting format. i'm on my cell. for seasonal jobs i cannot answer you sorry!
thank you for your answer.
so approximately $ 1,500 / month. it means that we would have to work just 2 days a week at minimum wage each to cover our cost of living .. it's interesting ..
access to water depends on the cities. often it is included in municipal taxes and therefore to the owner.
unlike france, we have no off-peak billing period for electricity, we just have a higher rate beyond a certain consumption. it is difficult to reach it without heating with electricity. but precisely speaking of heating, it varies from $ 60 per month to $ 300 per month for electricity depending on the dwelling. when it is paid in the rent, necessarily the rent is more expensive.
also, everything that is textiles is more expensive here, so clothing, sheets, etc. also, the surprise that often shocks is that taxes are not included in the price of the items, it is added to the invoice only. a 15% to calculate when you want to compare prices online.
finally, insurance costs are also very variable. for a 10 year old boy with a good record, you can do it for as little as $ 30 a month. a new car? 200? 300? you also have to insure your property or at least take out liability insurance. if you don't care about burning your sofa, your landlord will "sue" you for the costs in the event of a claim. $ 1m when you live in tight quarters, it's not too much.
thank you for your answer.
so approximately $ 1,500 / month. it means that we would have to work just 2 days a week at minimum wage each to cover our cost of living .. it's interesting ..
i don't really know your calculation, but 2 days / week at minimum wage for 2 people is $ 1,600 per month. but there are taxes, rent, gasoline, buy linen, repairs, etc.
let's say 2d / s at minimum wage is optimistic.
the rents are around $ 800-1000 / month, i don't know if you considered it in your calculation ...
are you philippe couillard?
> for a 10-year-old bazou with a good record, you can do it for not even $ 30 per month.
i don't know where you shop for insurance, but it's almost 3 times the least i paid in my life (with a very old car that was still doing pretty well): $ 105 per year.
auto insurance can easily go from one to four times for the exact same record from one insurance company to another. *** shop around for your insurance !! *** every year!
i have never heard of someone who worked 100 days a year for minimum wage and had enough money to make a good living.
13,51$x7,5x100 = 10 132$.
you are 2 to 3 times below the poverty line in quebec.
you have no chance of having any pleasure in life with these means.
as the others say, yes 1500 per month that can do for the fixed costs for two. on the other hand, 2d weeks each is not realistic if this is your plan.
even if your goal is to work the minimum to survive, it is not guaranteed that you will have a minimum wage job that guarantees you something like 2 full days per week only. and if so, it will surely be a night shift on the weekend. but otherwise, it's often full time, or filling in the 3h gaps of people who have more seniority, when the going is good. 3:00 p.m. wednesday to friday, 3:00 a.m. saturday morning and 5:00 a.m. sunday morning. and it will not be negotiable. and next week it's going to be other hours. it's not 9 to 5 monday-tuesday net money.
also, it's not for nothing that it's called a minimum wage. after taxes and other contributions, your minimum wage is still low even if you work full time.
oh boy, no i don't think working 2 days minimum wage is going to be enough, especially if your goal is to travel haha, but dreaming is fine i guess. ;-)
out of curiosity, what price did you put for the rent in your calculation?
i second.
i will live in a fully paid house. i ain't gonna have the rent or the money to pay
i will live in a fully paid house. i ain't gonna have the rent or the money to pay
$ 12 of groceries is a lot!
that's why i'm not even saying 30 a month. on the other hand, it also depends on the city. i don't know in quebec, but i know that just moving from montreal to levis, it reduced our insurance significantly. if you are under 25 vs over 25 it also changes a lot.
my calculation was:
1500/2 = 750/12 $ / hr = 65 hr / month / person / 4.2 week / month = 16 hr / week / person.
months i like to calculate the minimum and if we find more work, i will go and work more.
preferably full-time work but for 6 months per year.
i would buy a house in cash.
still, you have to pay taxes, you won't make $ 1600 in your clear pockets.
and all the other unforeseen events in life.
yes, there are several factors that cause insurance costs to vary. but i say that just by changing companies, with exactly the same file, the prices vary from simple to quadruple. when i call 10 different companies with exactly the same information, i get $ 600 per year and $ 2,500 per year.
eh?? do you have $ 300,000 cash to spend all at once? i don't understand what person is looking to get hired for minimum wage (so probably few qualifications?) while having that cash.
you are a funny character haha but good luck in your project
ah yes the famous percé rock, which appears alongside our great emblems such as the castle frontenac and the olympic stadium
who wanted to invade percé?
funny title and all but nasty good video editing like that. not so much quebec city ...
but on how many sub have you posted this video haha?
castle frontenac, isn't that far from the national assembly?
tourists, according to the publication's original title.
tourists see the quebec region very wide.
that's it, at the end of the famous grande alley
in winter there is no danger.
coming from alberta, this fall and winter weather is crazy warm! i'm hoping january and february are colder
this winter is not normal, for sure. i read somewhere that the whole winter is expected to be milder than normal this year.
there's a lot of really nice gin made in québec, go to any "selection" saq and ask for someone to show you the gin section you'll make some very nice discovery !
[coureur des bois maple whiskey] (
[maple cream also](
if you have acces to a car i was impressed by la domaine de la source à marguerite on l'ile d'orleans they sell alcohol made from their own fuit as well as other products. (they grow vines, apples and pears)  i would recommend their mistelle au pommes in particular (moût de pomme aged with scotch) but they also have an assortment of wines and ciders.  
if not you honestly can't go wrong at the saq they do a good job at promoting local products. look around on their website you can filter by quebec made products or i'm sure someone would be happy to help you in person.
all made in qc and very good !
mariana saint-crème distillery
loop lime and ginger
waxwing 
there is a nice little vineyard on île d'-orléans called 'vignoble isle de bacchus. their "réserve de bacchus" wine is no worse for all. "le brut de bacchus" is a sparkling white wine that compares favorably with many californian competitors in the same price range.
as for gins, "le trait carré" is done here and i liked it.
when i think of quebec-specific alcohol besides beer, maple-based liquor/liqueur is pretty much it. that tends to be sickeningly sweet though. i don't think quebec is known for its whisky or red wine.
maybe ice wine?
this might be a bit gimmicky but there's a top notch chocolate maker that had it's start in the québec city région and they released a chocolate liqueur recently. it's amazing.
2828 boulevard laurier, quebec, qc g1v 0b9
that's a big one
the coureur des bois is clearly the best bet!
there are good quebec gins too, i am thinking among other things of canopée. avril almond liqueur is also on the boat.
oh ice wine is a good idea. i know they like it, and have specific glasses for it, thanks.
i would recommend this ciderie.  they have a variety of different flavored ciders and ice ciders you can sample.  lovely people too.
amazing suggestion.  they love chocolat favoris.
thanks, i picked it up today, and it was an extra 500 saq points.
if the kid has fever, he should be kept at home, covid or not. if other symptoms appear, a test should be made. the kid can’t go back to school as long as he has uncontrolled fever.
i would start by calling 811 ( non emergency health line ) [
they can point you to the right place
fever = no school. pandemic or not.
i don't have any more information but welcome fellow anglo!
if they didn’t got vaccined yet, then yes, but normally, at my secondary school, everyone got vaccined. if it’s primary school kids, you should do it by precautions
[deleted]
yeah, i figured i'd keep both kids home because of the fever. i was more wondering about when they're better if anyone knew the steps to go back.
thank you! i learn something new everyday.
yes, i kept both kids home when 1 had a fever, which if no pandemic, the healthy kid would have gone in and kid 2 would stay home until fever free for 24 hours. i was more asking if people knew the steps for going back to school after they feel better.
yeah, as soon as a vaccine is available, they will get it. unfortunately, still too young though.
i did do that. however, my kids catch the bus at 710, called the school at 830, left a message, got a call back at 3pm. 
so i just asked to see if anyone else knew before i heard back.
if tomorrow they’re fine and the fever is gone they’ll be good to go. there’s no additional step to take unless they develop additional covid symptoms.
48 hours after the last fever sign, they can return to school.
i understand that, i wish you the best to your kids

there is the totem card game which is perfect for team building. it's quebecois in addition.
we're going to have a beer and play a game soon at the job as a cohesion activity.
the description looks like this:
totem is the personal development game that allows you to have fun while discovering your strengths and qualities through the eyes of others.
in turn, each player witnesses the construction of a totem pole in their image. this consists of an animal card associated with a strength and a quality card, both chosen by the other players. so get ready! others may see an unexpected spark in you.
omg, i hate work activities so much. the time when you have to put in even more effort to pretend to like others just to gain social capital and secure your career. sometimes the mask of work is heavier than your real face. especially if it is organized by "human resources", it is even more cringe.
it is surprisingly efficient and very simple.
i second the laser tag!
i believe people are between 24 and 40 years old. the average is around 34-35 years old.
ah yes, totally agree that it can be very cringe.
there is nothing worse than forcing the world to participate in activities.

add to that the via ferrata of the montmorency falls.
fyi i am double vaccinated, i always use a mask here in bc even if the protocols are not in place, and i always carry proof of it. just don't want to be seen as someone who's an idiot traveling during this times. the national championships are very important for my sport.

i mean, i like people asking questions and all... but i mean, a 1 second google search on quebec city with anything like whole food, juices, organic, or like 20 other possible things...
enjoy québec city!
i did it during a winter, from limoilou to boulevard kennedy.
it avoids a lot of traffic, it's more expensive, but it gives you personal time to relax. you have to synchronize with the boats. in winter it is 2 departures per hour and not 3 as in summer. i recommend subscribing to the text message alert in the event of a breakdown or service shutdown in order to better plan your transport. if unfortunately the boat has already left, it is always faster to take boulevard champlain than to go for the highway if you are at the landing stage on the north shore. on the south shore it is variable. always validate traffic delays with your gps before leaving work to adjust your trip accordingly. i always bought bundles of 10 banknotes, it's really cheaper in the long run.
having said that, i quit my job for several reasons and the distance / travel time was one of the main reasons if not the first.
good luck in your deliberation.
if you are considering purchasing an electric vehicle, the ferry is a good option, since evs travel for free on the québec-lévis ferry. however, the driver must pay for his passage at the pedestrian rate.
call first to make sure but i'm thinking of these places near or in the old town who might show it.

don't send a tourist to the duplessis area, it's embarrassing
this seems worth checking out: 
i plan to do the tour in a couple days.
bienvenue chez nous! there are some very interesting museums and i would says quebec city is quite the cultural powerhouse of canada. of course, speak french. or at least try.. it's a great opportunity to learn it. there is also near the fleuve saint-laurent in the château frontenac area where it's pretty chill. restaurants and all. covid restrictions just decreased and it's canada day so people are probably a lot more happy than the rest of this year due to covid. i hope you will like it here. you chosed the right season to come héhé.
enjoy

this looks interesting, thanks for sharing will check it out
thanks for the kind words, it's great that the city has reduced covid restrictions. i can speak elementary french, will definitely try to speak to the locals :)
i speak very little french
do not
aren't you going to piss us off too?
yes! and for extra scenic fun, take avenue royale instead of boulevard sainte-anne. there are some older houses and outbuildings (i think they were storage buildings? it's been a while) that date back several hundred years.
also, you can make a trip of it and visit montmorency falls and île d'orléans.
yeah its inpressive to see.
it is closed? i saw people going in last week. i also totally recommend taking avenue royale and check the montmorency falls from the park at the top, which is also on avenue royale
i meant if it is closed due to covid...who knows if it will be  open when we come in june. is it nice to walk around there?
thanks
we just moved our reservation to sept as douche ford thinks closing a border fights covid
"a 'catastrophic' rtc bus stop on rue franck-carrel in quebec city ends up in a contest to find the worst of its kind in the united states and canada." well done!
this sub is so thrash
i don't see it's anything so important that it's an old rcmp building. incentive to click, i imagine.
this building is * directly next to a primary school * (we see it on the left in the photo). it's not just ugly, it's a public danger.
it was still a fairly well known building in the area. it's a bit like saying "the old iga" or "the old mcdonald's" in some neighborhoods. i remember his time as an rcmp very well and with my friends we talk about “the old rcmp post” without necessarily blaming the rcmp for that, just so that we know what we are talking about.
the rcmp definitely had nothing to do with it.
it looks great!
my go-to for mechanics is pneus ratté hamel ([ but i honestly couldn't tell you whether they're better or worse than anyone else. they just happen to be the first place i took a car to because it was close to work and familiarity took care of the rest over the years.

alone or in a shared apartment? if you are satisfied with a 2½ or 3½ to live there on your own, you may be able to find some under $ 650 a month. but if you want something bigger and / or newer / luxurious, expect it to approach or exceed $ 1000 / month.

we really need to put together a wiki because we get this question daily lol. people are starting to ignore these threads our of repetition, i recommend you lurk past posts and hit the ones with many comments
i do hope you find what you were looking for in this sub and enjoy your trip here
i highly recommend [strom]( it's quite close to the old city.
strom is great and right downtown, if you want to be more in nature (30 minute drive from the city) there is the siberia spa which you can take a cold dip in a river.
not sure what kind of food you're looking for, but buvette scott is a very quaint and cozy spot with some high-quality food. be sure to reserve ahead of time though. for an intimate drink, check out the bar in the chateau frontenac, it's beautiful.
let me know if you have more questions. hope you have a wonderful visit!
electricity spa
it's surprising lol. there has been a dramatic increase as well. it's really cool, but at the same time it's often questions that get answered with very little time on google.
this is exactly what i was looking for! thank youuuu ☺️
all i see happening are tourist questions ... the sub is not really for the people of the city anymore
i told myself that it is better to ask the locals, instead of looking on google or other tourists tell me their experiences. at the same time, it gives me the opportunity to find less touristy places.
thank you for your reply.
the quebec tourism agency has promotions so that tourists book two nights for the price of one night.
besides, that's why i too come to visit quebec city 💃🏿💃🏿💃🏿
at the same time, if we wanted it to be fair for us, we had to call it villedequebec not quebeccity
or that we make it our own. there are really not many posts by the "locals", that gives a disproportionate proportion of tourist posts.
i totally understand the feeling, it was just an observation. like i said, it's still hot that the world is interested in our cultural interests as residents and not just in the tourist town. sorry if i upset you.
ah cool, so much the better.
i wish you a very nice visit! what time of year do you come?
anyone except gosselin please
i'm not sure what to think of marchand, he seems very soft on his positions.
it's going to be super tight between savard and marchand, but hey, one or the other, that won't change much. as long as gosselin doesn't sneak in, we're okay. :)
it's official it's marie josée savard who returns, if we got used to her history as a municipal councilor, we can expect a beautiful 4 years where nothing will happen ...
running mate:
* qff (montcalm): vallières-roland leads (39.8% vs. 29.7% for emjs)
* tq (limoilou): it was tight one end, but cloutier leads (36% vs. 27% emjs)
* q21 (ste-thèrese): blanchet leads, there are few offices left (38% vs. 32% qff)
* dq (cap aux diamants): qff leads (29% vs. 20% for dq). rousseau could lose his place.
you have to do it, quite honestly, to give yourself so much, to put your face on the signs, meet people, win your district ... and leave your place to your leader who has lost. hats off to these candidates.
the population of quebec is predominantly conservative. it would surprise me that we have a "wow" effect ...
update: well no, here it is wow 😁
the local branch of radio-canada covers the region's elections it seems to me. they have a facebook page and a youtube channel.
savard seems to have a head start in early voting tells me a little mouse
radio-canada has just declared marie-josée savard elected.
finally, i went to bed, it was savard as mayor and i got up and it was marchand. i would have liked to see patrice moi apologize to the audience, i guess he obviously didn't.
am i the only one to see that marchand is gaining ground?!? from 4000 votes ahead to 2700 in long steps?
so what did i win? : d
no chance. the little remnant of sympathy he could have, he lost with his presentation of the metro on friday night, it was pathetic. i don't like that the tram was mounted on a napkin but it was not much better with its presentation on friday.
he's a straw man. he is empty like trudeau. but i think he will win the same, he climbed quickly in the polls and he is backed as it can be by the firms of public relations.
i would prefer that we change the team, even if savard is not labeaume, the wear and tear of power is never good for the citizen.
i'm not really familiar with this concept, can you enlighten me?
just the radio i think
did savard also give a speech of defeat?
with our painful voting method, i'm always afraid that something like the vote will split between marchand and savard, who are quite similar, and let gosselin slip in between. but hey, he seems to have got off badly.
the only shame is that i would surely prefer a metro (with a much better map) than the tram, but he will take the idea to the grave with him.
i hope big big
my mother thinks he's handsome.
the only time i will upvote "empty like trudeau", cursed that i hate merchant.
at the municipal, it's a bit special: you vote for the mayor and for the municipal councilor. (unlike the provincial or the federal, where you are elected deputy, and if you are the leader of your party and your party has the most seats, you are the chief executive).
there is a special provision at the municipal council: you can appoint a running mate, a candidate who presents himself as a municipal councilor. this running mate is appointed before the election. you don't have to name a running mate (savard didn't).
if you lose your mayoral election and your running mate wins his election as municipal councilor, you take his place. this is how rousseau and gosselin were municipal councilors, even if they had lost their election, their running mate had won.
no, the party is in shock, with good reason. they explore legal remedies before speaking out.
edith: savard wrote to marchand to congratulate him. but no public appearance.
i think if we asked the supporters of the tram, "guaranteed, we have one or the other with roughly the same 25 km coverage." it just remains to choose the mode. a tram or a metro? ”, we all say“ a metro ”.
we would all like “better”, but we also know that governments are already having a hard time giving us “good”, so we'll be content. :)
he will finish 3rd. i don't think he's gonna stay after this.
these are the kinds of voters they should be targeting. everything about the image, nothing in the container.
it is the epitome of a puppet. in both cases.
in fact, in 2017, rousseau was himself the running mate of anne guérette, who could have taken her place, but chose to leave politics and let her running mate (jean rousseau) sit on the city council.
thank you for your answer!
if a mayor is elected but does not have a majority on city council, is that the equivalent of a minority government?
and she didn't have a necklace, so we'll never see her again.
it is clear that to choose, i would also go for the metro. the tram is going to be a major bread in the ass, i understand why they want to do it but personally, i would just wait 12-24 more months to see which edge the job market will take.
be careful, if this is not the case you will be held accountable.
as for justin trudeau
more or less, yes, except that the mayor has more power than a prime minister. i don't know if a minority municipal council limits the power of action of a mayor as much as a minority government at the provincial or federal level ...
hahaha no problem: d
it is not exactly a minority government. the chamber can overthrow a provincial and federal minority government. at the municipal level, the mayor cannot be dislodged in this way.
fun fact: municipal political parties is very, very rare in english canada. it is purely quebecois.
you're okay you can sleep without fear
it was rare in quebec also not so long ago.
fiou;)
me...
gasp!
1- bring your best snow coat, it will be cold! ;-)
2- vaccinal passport is required for restaurants and museuns. allways reserve on-line before going anywhere.
3- there are lots of decorations in the old city and the city is incredibly beautiful that time of the year, specially the "rue du petit champlain" and the "place royale". usually, there's a christmas market next to the town hall wich is opened until deceber 24th.
4- the best panoramic view of the city is in the "observatoire de la capitale", but it's still closed due to covid-19 restrictions (check it before comming, maybe they will re-open). the next best option is to have a brunch or a dînner at the restaurant le ciel.
5- the museuns "musée de la civilization" and "musée national des beaux-arts du québec" are allways good options. if you're into history, the "plains of abraham museum" is a very good option too.
6- the complex "village vacances valcartier" has an indoor water park, outdoor winter activities and, if the weather helps, the hotel de glace may be already opened for visitors. it's outside town, but it worth a visit.
7- you can visit and even climb the fortified walls of the city, a good place to start is the "place d'youville".
8- the falls "chute‑montmorency" are very beautifull in winter, but get ready for the cold.
thank you so much for your reply! we will be sure to bring a heavy coat and our vax passports!! last question, have you found covid has slowed a lot of the tourism or is it starting to pick back up?
tourism is starting to slowly picking up since this summer.
thank you, i imagined it would be slowly picking up! i plan to do some nighttime exploring down around old quebec so hopefully it isn’t too busy after dark in the evening!
i would like to make a small correction, this year's christmas market will be opened from 25 november to 23 december and they will have two other locations added to the original town hall, one at place d'youville and the oder at place d'armes (right next to the chateau frontenac).
thank you so much!! this is great to think about!
look for "rental condos", there is more chance that you find the kind of product that interests you.
for example:
[ 
[
this whole area of quebec (north of lebourgneuf) is in the process of being transformed into rental "luxury" condos so you could surely find what you are looking for there.
but now that i'm re-reading your post properly, it's far from the area you wanted. sorry.
i have a friend in the fresk towers, several tenants of this building are on contract for video game companies. no pool, but very central for your needs, no need to have a car.
on st-jean, the tower is older but the neighborhood is nice. just realize that this neighborhood is on a plateau. there are stairs, but this is to be taken into consideration.
they renovated a tower corner of st jean and sutherland, opposite the bonnet d'âne, it looked pretty.
look on marketplace on facebook.
> "luxury" rental condos
what's up with that? i noticed it too.
rental condos = the developer had condos built, didn't sell them and is now stuck with? how is luxury or approaching it?
> they renovated a tower at the corner of st jean and sutherland, opposite the bonnet d'âne, it looked pretty.
this is it precisely, one of those mentioned by op
no, i saw "rental condo" on aps buildings that are still under construction. i'm pretty sure it's just marketing. "rental condo" sounds more upscale than "apartment", so that's what they say.
100% are apartments that want to be fancy. it's window dressing but the fact remains that it will better meet the criteria of op since there is more chance that it will include a gym for example.
as of right now, nightclubs aren't open because of covid. only seated bars are.
just walk on grande allée take a peak in every place before choosing one. it’s easier for a tourist than to go on a hunt of the scattered places. have fun also there is nothing to be sorry about being anglophone you will be surprised how people will be welcoming the freak out about language is in the newspapers not on the streets.
two 22
go to old quebec, it’s amazing there! a christmas store is opened all year, and many other stuff!
and you have to be double vaxx
shaker, district, atelier, phoenix, etc
ozone, shaker st-foy
ah i didn’t think of that, we are coming in from toronto where they are so i just assume. but bars are fun too, do you have any favourites?
putting covid aside for a moment, which nightclub still exist?
all three of us are double vaxxed :)
la cuisine on saint-vallier st is a must for an intimist 80's vibe. i think that mcfly (barcade) is also open. pheonix on parvis st. is also a nice place.
sacrilege is cool!
by curiosity, how does it work in to for nightclubs ? doublevax and a mask ? we have a protest in montreal in a week to reclaim open dancefloors.
great question. dagobert is, but you're right that it was in decline even before covid.
doublevax and masks indeed. once you're seated you can remove your mask. you also need a proof of vaccination.
its kind of iffy to be honest depending on where you go, for the big outdoor raves we had you need to show proof of double vax but no masks needed and no social distancing really at all, inside clubs as far as ive experienced there's no masks either, but you must show proof of vaccination. it all feels pretty normal to me. i actually went to montreal recently and will be going after qc and they were a little stricter but some of the bars i went to honestly just felt like a club, dancing indoors and no masks etc
it depends on your budget.
try the café du monde in the old port.
sapristi is in the old and they still have interesting choices at a reasonable price for the old.
in the lower town, le clocher penché and the maelstrom are open. in limoilou, la planque (possibly full too).
go to the owls and the owl c is run by native french people you will be well served and get your money's worth friends, have a good one 💭
all the restaurants of the resto pleasures group you are sure to have good value for money.

try the signature on 3rd avenue. avoid going inside the gates of the old
we would like to try to stay below the all-inclusive cad $ 100 bar (we don't drink wine, so that's always saving money). i'm going to look at the world cafe menu, thank you!
i found "the fox and the owl" and i guess that's it. according to their website, they are only open from thursday to saturday. : /
apparently, they are closed on sunday evening (according to tripadvisor), but we will keep them in mind for tomorrow's lunch, thank you!
otherwise, try the cochon dingue.
ah yes fox and the owl haha they have another joint restaurant to this one i do not remember the name, good luck anyway!
this is where we had lunch today (and last night we ate at billig).
[le croquembouche]( is a nice option and delivers on sundays if the amount of the order is $35 or more. you can order online.
i might have an idea. when is his birthday?
do u need help ordering?
le croquembouche is an amazing option, did not know they delivered.  
i had in mind chez érico for the cake and find a way to deliver (i would have volunteered), but this seem the best alternative. and le croquembouche is stuck in the middle of a construction site right now, it is a great way to help them in a time when business is slower than usual.
they've updated the post, it's on sunday.
it’s sunday the 3rd of october
if i saw correctly, the bq lost a county to the ccp, right?
hello, is it still available? :)
yes!
i'll send you a private message shortly.
i was looking for just that. i have so much no idea what represents what just looking at the election signs.
there are so many, but i recommend jacques cartier national park
for other suggestions, i advise you to explore the following site:
if you are looking for smaller and more accessible trails there is mont wright and stoneham. you can search on the alltrails app
there are really a lot of possibilities! the parc de la jacques-cartier is the classic place from quebec. not much further, there is the massif du sud (also great for camping!) and the bras-du-nord river. if you are ready to travel a little more, the grands-jardins and hautes-gorges parks are really great.
with autumn approaching, cap-tourmente is also pleasant in addition to offering the spectacle of migrating geese.
the meshtashibo in saint-féréol-les-neiges ... start at the church. sturdy anyway.
if you are ready to take a little road (about 1 hour), i recommend the massif du sud, its advantage is that it has a good variety of routes; long, short, easy, difficult. easy to find what you need there.
check out the 5 peaks challenge, the mountains on it change a little every summer. it'll give you lots of ideas.
my suggestion of the day: mont à ligori
empire 47 has beautiful hiking trails
thanks for the suggestion!
great resource of information! i appreciate it enormously :)
* nina pizza napolitaine (st-roch)
* pizzeria no.900 (limoilou)
* toujours 2 pour 1 pizza (st-roch, looks like nothing but its good greasy pizza)
* attaboy pizzeria de quartier
* la boîte à pain (the one in limoilou has a pizza oven)
* casse-croûte pierrot (limoilou, another greasy style pizza place)
spent some time in italy before the pandemic, never found a pizza place there that could beat nina pizza on st-anselme street. 
in limoilou, i like la boite à pain (3th avenue, near the 4th street): cheaper, but still good and simple neapolitan pizza.
there is a nina pizza on st-jean street (outside the walls, in st.jean baptiste) and they close the street there sometimes. they put tables in the street, the vibe is nice.
thousand and one pizza
ive talked about this in the pass, nina's is so overrated. 
i'm still looking for something like you are and i think ive settled for toujours 2 pour 1.
nina. that’s it.
pierrot by far
nina. best pizza i ever ate.
capriccio on the corner of 1st avenue and 12th street.
for me, there's no question it's a garnie at pierrot pizza.
another vote for attaboy here. great pizza. nina & 900 as well, but different style.
thank you!! we will check them out!!
have you tried capriccio on 1st avenue, no 900 on maguire or emporium on henri-bourasssa? with nina, these are the best places for italian pizza in quebec.
edit: i just noticed that [no 900] ( is a montreal chain and that they have 3 branches in quebec: maguire, 3e avenue and st-paul.
thank you!! sounds like some great options!
> nina's is so overrated.
why did you choose violence this morning?
is the attaboy better than the one on st-jean? i find that one pretty bland/wet.
those are indeed great options ! pizza 900 is also nice in limoilou area. check it out and have a nice trip !
imagine always preferring 2 for 1 versus nina! joke aside it's two completely different style of pizza that can't be compared!
new york (cheap) and italian. i'm not judging those who like north american pizza (new york style), but they are indeed 2 quite different styles.
i'm not sure that the clubs are open for that yet, with the restrictions and all. normally people would go to la cuisine, le rideau rouge, le drague, le sacrilège, most clubs on la grande allée (uptown near the old city gates, always a lively place with lots of mingling). there's the phoenix du parvis which is new and replaced a dance bar as well. good luck!
did you forget that there was a global pandemic going on? going dancing close to other strangers is completely irresponsible. please reconsider.
there is a sunset event at the hilton pool area this friday. rsvp  
le drague is probably the biggest club in town.
it's an lgbt club so you also won't get bothered by guys.
otherwise the dag is more classic clubby and district is a little classier.
they still can't serve alcohol after midnight
la grande allée is where most of the clubbing happens in québec city. a long time ago, you could find large crowds at bars such as le dagobert and some would say it was bumping until late. now, with covid and everything, you'll find things a bit tamer. however, it's still worth taking a stroll around there after dinner, basically between hotel le concorde and the manège militaire, to see what's up. 
in my younger days, la ninkasi also got pretty loud on fridays. it's not a club per say, but people do go there and dance and the party could wrap-up just before last call. it's on rue st-jean, right next to le drague (as a matter of fact, it used to also be a gay bar). this is a also a good area to wander if you're looking for a bit of ambiance.  
as others have said, it's harder to find a proper party these days, but i hope it works for you!
same as footloose, illegal! no dancing in the middle of a pandemic
dance floor in clubs are definitely not open yet, you cannot even be more than a group of 10 people inside at a restaurant.
you can dance and keep a social distance.
dancing doesn’t mean rubbing yourself against a stranger…
that's what i thought. haven't even thought of trying to find somewhere to dance, but i was surprised how busy la grande allée was a month ago. merci pour la confirmation!
that’s what happen with time and alcool. austrian ballroom dance is no more common practice.
ive never seen or heard of any turkish barbers in quebec. but i would recommend luxe barbershop. i dont remember if its 20$ or 15$ they charge. 
barber shop le central corner ste-foy and myrand. the only no bs barber shop i had found in the past.
best in town sami le barbier! 200 4th street in downtown qc
thanks for all the recommendations. i found a place called tequila barbers, and they did an amazing job for $25.

thank you! i am going to check this out.

i grabbed a restock in store at ebgames thanks to this twitter account
i was lucky with shopper's drug mart. a friend and my brother were also successful with their website, like me.
there are a lot of scalpers on kijiji and facebook marketplace anyway.
frankly, the best way is to use a discord server that has setuper alerts when there is stock to be detected somewhere. him from / r / videogamedealscanada is pretty good.
there are private servers here and there and also twitch streams which are setup for that
personally, i was able to get an rtx 3060 with the help of the / r / videogamedealscanada discord.
last weekend he had some stock at the pharmaprix in old lorette (well it's not quebec city, but almost) call them to see.
you can look at this [site] ( sometimes you might be lucky, you can put notifications by email or sms to get enough updates. quickly. i managed to buy a 3070 with this site before christmas. good luck!
stock at best buy galeries de la capitales and place laurier! (disc)
cool thx.
f the scalpers. thanks for the links.
bookmarked for later! i'll give you feedback soon.

this is the most creative kevin-trap i've seen in ten years on reddit.

2$ give or take
xd so much
like who would want to catch a kevin anyway?
une karo.
what is an urbex?
quickly, too, in the corner of charlesbourg i don't think you're going to have any! old enough abandoned pi stuff gets demolished it's not too long, (unless it's heritage)
i do it from time to time and it is difficult in the city.
1. most spots get destroyed too quickly
2. there is always security
i don't know urbex and i haven't tested what i'm going to share with you, so take it with a grain of salt, but i saw this the other day, i don't know if it can help you to interest.
the pollack house in the upper town and the old auberiviere in st-rock.
spa the right place for that here lol, you're just gonna get puny answers. if you're ready to break to go home, the industrial outskirts of charlesbourg look cool.
in the city center there is a good corner at pointe au hièvre which is crumbling in front of the eyes. good luck
old factory of alco brakes on pointe aux lievres i came back last week
i don't believe there is the uberx option in quebec unfortunately.
urbex (urban exploration) is in fact the exploration of abandoned buildings in the city
ok
ok
can we get into the pollack house (kind of a way to get in)?
thanks
we had come in through the back door in time (like a year and a half) no idea if it still works.
ok i'll stop by and see when i come around
i have my osteopathy clinic, and i need this :)

camp keno is the way to go in quebec city
no one even knows if summer camps will be a thing this year yet. last year, they were mostly (all?) closed.
as others said, it's not certain what will be open this summer, but there's already listings for jobs at camps on the official site of the quebec camps association:
[
only in french at the moment; hope that helps!
camp trois-saumons is also a pretty great place. and yeah, let’s hope camps will be open this year!
if you are in the quebec city region, and willing to work with people with special needs, check out the grand village (they are always looking for people, open year round) highly recommend it, i know a bunch of people who've worked there
you can try looking at the explore program! i'm not sure which locations will be in person though
hey i work in a summer camp, we have both an english and french camp. you can pm me for more details.
i'm pretty sure a lot of the camps were opened last year, i remember they had trouble finding people to fill the positions
day camps were mostly open last year, with more staff than usual to have smaller groups.
[duproprio.com] ( and [realtor.ca] ( are really good.
on the centris.ca site they have a tool for that ... otherwise if you want something more thorough, i know that brokers have databases
“real estate radar” is surely what you are looking for. 
late to the party ... are you looking for something like this?
[
thank you, i am looking for a monthly / annual report to follow the price variation. do these websites provide regular price trend reports?
thank you, i am looking for a monthly / annual report to follow the price variation. do these websites provide regular price trend reports?
yes that's it! thank you.
maybe cmhc publishes that kind of information?
i haven't had a car for 6 years and i do everything on foot or in the communauto. i also take the bus occasionally, but not since the pandemic. it is good when you live and work in central neighborhoods.
i take communauto for essentially the same reasons as you foresee. if it's to go hiking or skiing in the surrounding area, that's fine, but as soon as it goes up to an hour's drive, it's more expensive than renting a car elsewhere.
but i love the principle of communauto and if it is not to use a car on a daily basis, i think it is better not to have one. we can still manage without it, even in quebec.
it is done very well.
are you not far from a metro bus? are you in the community area with a car nearby? if so, you're in business.
> - grocery store 1x every 2 weeks (to go to a maxi / super c / costco for bulk stuff cheaper)
doing your grocery shopping online and having it delivered is cheaper than renting the community.
> - go to a cross-country / random ski center 1-2x a week or so
you can bring your skis on the bus.
> - bring my dog to the vet when necessary if it is not possible to go there on foot / same thing for the toilet.
there communauto will be useful.
> - possibly 1 mtl round trip per month (possible that the car rental is cheaper for that)
orléans express is $ 25 non-refundable if you reserve 2 weeks in advance or $ 35 otherwise. it's an express that leaves once an hour. you wouldn't get there any faster by going there by tank.
> is it possible in quebec to get by with the buses and communauto for this kind of trip or will i regret (like, is the economy going to be worth the puzzle or not at all!)?
absoutely. public transportation in quebec is excellent, it's just that it doesn't cover everywhere as well.
start without, give yourself two months and decide afterwards if you need one.
your schedule seems to me to be very feasible with only public transport and the monthly rental to return to montreal.
i'm not even sure you need communauto.
short answer: communauto is great.
** communauto for purchases and for the dog **
communauto has many plans to meet all needs: freedom, economic, long distance, work. there is also the communauto flex service.
i use communauto, an economical package, with the discount with the rtc's abbonne bus. i use it to go buy water 2 x 18.9 l. it hurts in the bus. also go to canadian tire.
** communauto vs discount for long distance **
to go to montreal, i think discount will be competitive if it's a multi-day trip, but not necessarily. with discount, you pay for the number of hours, the number of kilometers is unlimited, but the customer pays for gasoline. with communauto, you pay for the number of hours and the number of kilometers. there is a credit card in each communauto vehicle for gasoline. with discount, insurance is very expensive. with communauto, insurance is much cheaper.
last summer, we went to saguenay with a discount vehicle. very clean, i recommend it. large selection of vehicles. i had calculated, and communauto would have been about 30% cheaper than discount. but communauto is toyota prius or toyota corolla. for the less expensive, communauto. for the best vehicle, discount. discount vehicles are very clean. communauto, it depends.
**discount**
* 5 days: $ 179.95
* unlimited km
* gasoline paid by customer
* fee: $ 24.10
* protection (insurance): $ 149.75
* subtotal: $ 353.60
* gst: $ 17.68
* tvq: $ 35.27
* total: 406.55 $
** community calculation **
* 5 days
* 1000 km
* gasoline paid by communauto
* long-distance economic package: $ 291.75 + tx
for cross-country skiing,
you can go to the beauport, maizeret and riviere saint-charles outdoor center with the 800.
it depends a bit. if you are near the university you will be able to take the 800 buses quite a bit everywhere. and communauto is super good for 2-3 hour outings. but it gets quite expensive and quite difficult to find a car if you want to leave town (eg to ski) all day.
it is very fair. i have several friends who live near their jobs and it doesn't bother them at all.
this is the use case of the typical communauto customer.
your conclusion is astonishing ... how can public transport be great if the coverage is so poor? what are the other criteria? i am not so far from the city center and the service is very poor. a single bus line that passes every half hour at rush hour, and it sometimes happens (although this is rare) that it skips a route, without explanation.
no, public transportation in quebec is far from what it should be for a city of its size. but hey, people don't seem to want to give up a single inch of road to buses / trams ...
> orléans express is $ 25 non-refundable if you reserve 2 weeks in advance or $ 35 otherwise. it's an express that leaves once an hour. you wouldn't get there any faster by going there by tank.
i loved taking the bus to go to quebec or even via rail (my family lives on the south shore so i often did mtl-qc before the covid) and my boyfriend kept the dog in mtl but there, the dog comes with me to quebec therefore no longer possible :(
1000 km is 621.37 miles
> last summer, we went to saguenay with a discount vehicle. very clean, i recommend it. large selection of vehicles. i had calculated, and communauto would have been about 30% cheaper than discount. but communauto is toyota prius or toyota corolla. for the less expensive, communauto. for the best vehicle, discount. discount vehicles are very clean. communauto, it depends.
absolutely agree with your observation. personally, i suggest finding a credit card that offers auto rental insurance. it then becomes a lot more interesting to use discount (or something like that) for day / weekend rentals.
> your conclusion is astonishing ... how can public transport be excellent if the coverage is so poor? what are the other criteria?
for a well-situated person it goes number one. i have an 800 at 2 minutes for example.
the answer to if you can make arrangements by public transport in quebec is yes if you choose your location accordingly.
small or big dog? via rail accepts animals if they are small enough to fit in a cage next to you.
bad bot
if you do west-east, it's excellent. if you want to do any other trip it's quite difficult and unattractive. the university is pretty much a focal point with a lot of lines so that should be okay.
big enough; standard poodle!
if i remember correctly, i could travel with caged with via rail even with this size too but with a charge of $ 50 one way. so if i just do 1 go let's say before the christmas holidays etc it might still be worth it.

for "local" work, my best experience was for a french company called [coyote] ( and which had created a lab here in quebec to have its backend rewrite. we rewrote everything, then we trained the team in france to maintain the new code. it was an extraordinary time for me.
unfortunately, we were never able to find enough developers and when a colleague and i left for other things, the lab closed its doors (the other devs continued to work remotely for the team in france, i believe).
but my best work experiences have been with remote work. working remotely for companies elsewhere in canada or the united states suits me very well. and it allowed me to combine the advantages of a small town (i live in lévis) while working with a very diverse team. salaries can also be better than the average found here.
but remote working is not for everyone. if you are a more outgoing person, you will suffer a lot, i believe.
i spent several years at coveo and found it to be a good school.
it has grown since then but i still have several friends there and i would not be afraid to recommend.
if you want smaller, check out the city's startups! between poka, botpress, snipcart, braver, xpertsea, etc ... not to mention the indie video game studios. there are quite a few choices.
it depends on what you want to do! the good news is that most employers are hiring, so you have multiple opportunities.
interestingly, i didn't know that it was really possible to do 100% remote with a company from the usa, at least i didn't see a lot of offers that go in this direction.
most ^ (\ [ref. needed \]) american tech companies already have companies in canada to hire people like that. the company where i work at present registered a company in ottawa to withhold tax at source (federal and provincial.)
i have a lot of friends in the same situation. but i also know a guy who works for an american company that has no formal presence in canada, so he gets paid by transwise transfer. i find that less interesting, because the tax part becomes more complicated. but he is happy.
> i haven't seen many offers that go in this direction.
it depends on how you search. it is less obvious, but you have to apply for the positions you find on the web even if they are not explicitly "remote". once your cv grabs attention and a recruiter gets in touch, just negotiate to work remotely.
it is also done with european companies.
we just elected a new mayor so it's entirely possible the project will change.
expocité (the area with the centre videotron) is not on the path of the tramway, but connected through a trambus.
it'll be more obvious with this [pdf map ](
edit: below is updated map but doesn't show trambus connections, hard to get good data atm it seems. but yeah basically the answer is no tram there, a bus connection instead
look at the 800 metro bus line, pretty much that. but it extends a bit further west and a lot less eastward
lets hope they dont build it and get somthing that serves the population better
this card is really not up to date, charlesbourg is no longer planned.
here is the last card: 
thank you/merci
ah, except that we can no longer see the bus connections. not easy to get information.
lol wow. i was not aware of the new route. holy shit. this is really crap. you might as well take the bus
have fun !
chalou (some locations, including [le grand marché] ( je bois local, le monde des bières, some random very well stocked convenient stores spread around town ...
there are a lot of options. where will you be staying? we can recommend something close.
the beer box, route de l'eglise / avenue sasseville
la place in st-roch has a solid selection of local beers.
malt axis on rue d'aiguillon!
the duchess of aiguillon on rue st-jean!
alimentation l'impact has certainly the biggest selection but no service, so you will be lost in 10 000 skus without knowing what is shit and what is good. they buy everything and filter nothing. beer is rarely fresh.
i suggest going to axe du malt
they have a good selection and filter out bad breweries.
and their staff will help out.
chalou
thanks!
le grand marché is great if you are a tourist.
i am driving, so anything on the west or south side of the city will be convenient. i am staying in old quebec.
> the beer box, route de l'église / avenue sasseville
thank you!
well if you're in the old city you can buy directly from many microbreweries. pick your poison!
if you want a one stop shop, check out le monde des bières (the world of beers)   
[
la duchess d'aiguillon is a great place too and might be close to your spot.  
you also have l'axe du malt nearby  
a bit further out there's je bois local (i drink local)  
[  
this should be plenty enough!
le monde des bières has indeed a great selection and is my go-to place. 
i would add "la superette du diner" to the list, which is near (and owned by the same guys as) le diner, a small dinner restaurant loved by locals (and many fellow redditors here). it is in the lower part of the city  [
thanks for all the great selections!
thank you, i will probably check out le diner as well!
it is beautiful in winter indeed. i recommend the winter carnival, comme see bonhomme! 
let's say in christmas time, it's a bit weird. temperatures in december hover around 0c. faque you can have beautiful big white fairy snow one day, worse the slush of mustard the next day, worse all freezes in cabochon on the 3rd day.
for the true "quebec hivernale" version, the month of february with the carnival is a little less risky.
bonhomme d'neige is something i remember from tv as a kid. we have winterlude here which is similar i'm sure. on the list for research now. merci beaucoup!       
edit: "float" like the vehicle in a parade all decorated with stuff & music & lights ;) is what you mean .. i think
i realize now the website doesn't have much info yet, and last year was not as cool because of covid, but there's all kind of events across town, there's a ice hotel built each year that you can visit or stay in, winter playgrounds, ice sculpture competition with sculpture all across town, it's decorated, and parades of.. i can't find the word in english someone help! "chars allégoriques" (funky véhicules with people on them?
good luck translate this...
so i read it a few times; pondered words i know 100% & context. 
then read it aloud to my "helper" (my spouse is a francophone) and worked through it.    
i've deduced it's very much a "don't like the weather, wait twenty type minutes" thing.....           
and another vote for the snowman;).
i'm used to the lovely gatinese aka franglais here in ottawa so quebec city is different
he (she?) says the december weather around christmas isn't great because it's around the freezing point and very unpredictable (some beautiful big flakes snow one day, followed by squashy mud-like water-filled snow that then freezes in an annoying way the next day over).
thanks friend! i keep re-reading it so i can spout it back if the opportunity arises. worked for my french so far (i've come a long way from 'ou est le toilet?')
well, the commenter used some slang that would be harder to decipher for a learner. don't beat yourself up for not getting it easily ;-)
as everyone will tell you:
- walking around chateau frontenac
- visit the old quebec
- go to montmorency falls
if you have time you could also check :
- ile d'orleans
- have a drink in the best microbreweries in qc
- eat at the restaurant in top of the concorde
here is a copy of a comment i made on another thread. it's the general tourist version of a city guide, if i knew more about you i could be more precise, for example there are many micro-breweries that are worth a visit, or stuff for kids, or hiking spots, etc. as you know most everything is re-opening right now so double-check beforehand, you may need a vaccine proof and id card.
so for a start, the chateau frontenac on terasse dufferin is the most photographed hotel in the world its quite impressive to see, from there go down to quartier petit champlain, its an absolute must see even tough there are a lot of tourists. if you are into spooky stuff, there are ghost tours of the area as well. from down there you can take the ferry to lévis, where you will have the best view of québec city, they also have a nice old town and a history of their own. back in québec, the citadelle is a multiple century old military fort, there is a museum in there you can visit. the plains of abraham is a important site in the history of canada, where a big (but quick) battle was fought between the english and the french. the parliament is near that, you can also visit it, the architecture is beautiful. grande-allée, is a nice busy street to walk on, there is a rotating restaurant on top of the concorde hotel. for another good view, look for the city's observatory, its on top of the tallest building. not too far is the modern art museum witch is built into an old prison its quite interesting. the rue st-jean is one of the most popular street, its a quaint shopping district. when you see the hotel-dieu, the oldest hospital in north america (there's a museum) you can go down to the lower city where you will find rue st-joseph and the marina. the lower city is way less tourist-y, there's a good selection of boutiques and not too pricey restaurants. to the west of the core city area, the aquarium is pretty cool, there is a very nice park outside with a beautiful view of the bridges and the river. to the east is the ile d'orléans, take the ring road, its a country experience right next to the city there is a buch of farms you can visit. it's also right by the montmorency falls which are also quite impressive, there is a park there and a kind of ski lift with an amazing view. if the remparts (the city's junior hockey team) are playing at the videotron center, take a look! the arena is still brand new and nhl ready, the ambiance is always electrifying. there is a shoping center called les galleries de la capitale a little outside the city, with an indoor amusement park, arcade, ice skating area and fancy food market, its quite impressive. if you're willing to go a bit out of the city (20min by car), check out the village vacance valcartier, its a huge winter amusement park with massive slides and indoor water-park, tons of fun! oh! n'oubliez pas d'essayer la poutine! chez gaston on rue dorchester will give you the best potato shack poutine experience and its open very late, poutineville on rue saint-joseph is fancyer and more of a restaurant experience, they have more variety (but pretty much anywhere you go you will find poutine!)
i would say avoid eating and shopping in the old city, it's very good, but also super touristy and you will pay the price. other than that anything in the tourism guide (www.quebec-cite.com/en/) is worthwhile i would say, it depends on what you enjoy personally. one last thing, people here can easily switch to english, especially in the old quebec and other tourist spots, but we all appreciate someone making the effort, to start with what little french they know, even if its only "bonjour!" and "merci!". as an isolated island of french culture in north america, we are quite proud of our roots!
i hope you have a wonderful time in our beautiful city!
you you need a proof of vaccination to enter into restaurants and museums.
awesome, thank you! i’ll put these on the list :)
thank you for this! so so helpful - we will check out as much as we can! we don’t have kids and love wineries, coffee, tea, hiking, art and music.
really appreciate the detailed post! i'm going to québec city this weekend as well and was wondering if you can tell us more about it's nightlife. my girlfriend is less into beers and more into cocktails, we are in our early thirties, any recommendations for places we can enjoy nice drinks? do bars close late into the evening with covid restrictions? thank you!
thanks for the heads up!
hope you'll like our city !
for wineries, île d'orléan is the spot ( 
for art, i mentioned the museum of modern art, there is also the museum of civilisation. also around the cartier petit champlain there are at leas a dozen private art galleries really close to each other (
for hiking i recently went on a walk along the river st-lawrence and the views were amazing. look for plage jacques cartier. if you are willing to go a little bit outside the city, look for parc de la forêt ancienne du mont wright. its one of the most popular trail.
right now its no alcohol past midnight and they close at 1am, there are masks and distancing. on novembre 1st it changes back to normal which is close at 3am and thats it. my info on nightlife is from 10 years ago tough! i know the dagobert was the biggest dance club and la grande allée was the place to be, i am told that is less the case nowadays. for cocktails i had a really cool one chez tao on rue saint-vallier ouest and also at the shaker st-joseph. hope you have fun!
thank you. added to the list! really appreciate your help.
it's pretty quiet on wednesdays ... especially with the covid. in summer there are the terraces, but there ... blah. you can always go to the lizard ball on 3rd avenue, la cuisine sur st-vallier or as mentioned above, the workshop on main alley. good luck!
check for the rue du parvis, in particular the "phoenix du parvis". i often go there after work with colleagues and there are always people at the party. not * a lot * of people on wednesdays, but still.
otherwise you can try the microbreweries; noctem, souche limoilou, barberie, griendel ...
then last resort there might be a few bars on myrand street, but i haven't been there since the covid!
the workshop?
there are also some cool bars on st-joseph in the lower town!
i guess the best place you could go in on the grande allée though not sure it will be a popular night as it rains. otherwise, you could try le pub at université laval if it still exists.

if you want a nice dinner, the bistro chez boulay. a little expensive, but you get a wonderful experience.
thanks everyone!! 🙏🙏
le continental has a pretty good table, with a classic french and italian bent. 
their creme brûlée is beautiful, and the flamed pears a thing of beauty.
the case is ketchup, patent and thing & kraken cru are absolutely amazing
not an asshole, that's helpful. thanks!

i drive all over québec-maritimes in the winter because i love snow, the outdoors, hiking, camping and snowsports. i do this with an old but faithful toyota corolla. never had an issue, but i drive responsibly in foul weather. so you'll be fine!  
get good winter tires if you haven't already (pirelli, blizzaks, etc), don't drive above your comfort level (stop, take breaks if you have to), don't overtake another car in bad conditions and keep it relaxed. being stressed at the wheel is more dangerous than snow, and it's super dangerous with snow.  
all this being said, we have excellent infrastructure for snow removal, it'll be all good.  
quebec city and the region is beautiful under a blanket of snow.
two words that are important to know for winter driving in québec: snow tires. 4wd is sometimes useless without snow tires. for the winter activities in the québec city région, read the sub, there's so much informations.
there usually isn’t too much snow in december. in many years we don’t get our first real snowfall before the second week of december or even a few days before christmas. so chances are snow should not be a problem for you (but every year is different, permanent snow can also be here as soon as mid november).
however weather will drop below freezing point at night making the road icy early in the morning or late in the evening. usually not an issue if you stay in the city but something to consider if you’re planning to go in the countryside.
winter tires are highly recommended (and mandatory for vehicles registered in quebec). all seasons tire will not cut it on a icy road in cold weather. even if you have a awd vehicle, the problem being to stop when you break…
i would also recommend to not be too tight in your schedule and have a plan b in case a sudden snowstorm cause your return trip to be delayed by 1-2 days.
also bring warm clothing since december can be quite cold by pennsylvania standards. temperature around -10 to -15 celsius aren’t unusual most of the month and can drop to -20 -25 on very cold days (mostly at the end of the month). to make matter worst, the air in quebec tends to be moist, making it feel even colder. btw, bring an ice scraper for your car since you will surely have the scrape the ice on the windshield and windows every morning because of this moist air.
i've consistently heard raving reviews about a restaurant called tanière. pricy but if it's within your budget it might be worth your while.
not to hijack your thread, i am also visiting in december though i’m from a much warmer state. i also have questions about the cold and was wondering if this jacket is appropriate for early dec - 
i used to drive an old toyota corolla back in the back and i swear that thing handled things better than my newer suv. good ole toyota. 
anyway, thank you for your advice and recommendations. i’m definitely going to invest in some better tires and take it easy on the drive to and from.
i'd like to add they are legally obligated in the winter here so either get a rental or get real winter tires. all season doesn't count
this a thousand time. 4wd is great, but it doesn't make you stop any faster. it all starts with the tires.
thanks for the reply! it’s funny that you mention temperature, because that’s another thing i was slightly concerned about. i don’t plan on doing any snowboarding or skiing or anything of the sort. i only planned to visit the city for a few days. i was assuming that i could pop into shops here and there to stay warm. 
i will definitely invest in some winter tires. thanks for the suggestion!
from reviews i could find on canadian sites, it is not the best. from experiance if you don't want to look like michelin man down jacket are not so warm. layering is the key. find a good coat, where a thick sweater and something under. do not skip gloves or mits, wear a good thick scarf and a tuque (warm beanie).
seems a bit much to me! december in quebec city is a bit unpredictable; some years it starts snowing on halloween, and some others, we get rain on christmas day. like proum said, layering is key here, especially if you're going to do a lot of walking and tourist-y stuff, such as visiting buildings and stores (lots of inside-outside), etc. 
i'd suggest you go with a thin puffer jacket with a good sweater underneath that you can easily take off and put on, maybe with a long sleeves t-shirt. you'll definitely want a tuque, scarf and gloves or mittens, but i wouldn't invest too much on that before you leave because that can be a really cool thing to buy here from small shops as a souvenir. 
honestly, don't worry too much. there's plenty of stores where you can buy more appropriate clothing if you need to (simons, sports experts, décathlon is really cheap also, etc.). just don't drop 300$ on something not that great that you won't wear often.
oh wow, i didn’t know they were legally obligated. thanks so much for letting me know. i would have been really sad if i would have drove the whole way there just for them to refuse to let me in because of my tires!
i definitely second the recommendations of having a flexible travel schedule and an ice scraper. a small shovel won't go awry either, especially if you're parked outside: you may end up having to dig your car out of the snow and that stuff is no joke when it's been plowed. 
for driving, main throughways are generally cleared quite fast during and after a snow storm. side streets, however, will accumulate packed snow over the winter. in general, it's wise to drive a good 5-10 km under the speed limit, especially if you're not used to the new conditions. be mindful of ice too, both black ice and that pesky layer of ice under loose snow. this also applies to walking, for the record! i’m pretty sure most everyone in the province will lose their footing at least once each winter! oh, and letting your car run for a few minutes before heading out will allow it to heat up and clear up windshields. 
as for activities, i’d say a lot of it will depend on covid. i haven't followed all the regulations in other provinces/states, but last year, for example, we had a 8 pm curfew for several months. we currently have vaccine passports for eat-in restaurants and cinemas and such. not to say you shouldn't come, but activities might be really restricted, and many shops may be closed. i'd keep an eye on things; the government has a decent [website]( that i've been using to help stay up to date on the evolving restrictions. 
if you decide to come in the spring, do be warned that our spring is often a lot later in the year. it's also more of a season of "melt": you may well see people walking around in t-shirts in 15°c weather with a few remaining shoulder-height snowbanks slowly melting away. you might also enjoy coming during the winter carnaval (early february), especially if you have kids: i quite enjoyed the games they had when i was young. i haven't gone much in recent years, but i think there was some fun stuff to do for adults as well. 
things that can be fun to see (i’m not sure how many of these will be around due to covid): 
- going for a walk through the old quebec city, especially after a fresh snowfall 
- the plains of abraham and place d'youville have skating rinks. there are also places with cross-country or downhill skiing and snowshoeing if that's more your thing. i’m partial to the skating rink in [shannon]( they have a path through the woods that's all lit up!
- the promenade champlain along the river's edge is lovely (although quite windy!)
- the german christmas market
wow!!! thank you so much for your detailed response! i really appreciate the thought put into it and all of the suggestions. it makes planning so much easier. thank you again!
[deleted]
since the start of the pandemic, i don't know many shops open 24 hours a day, unfortunately. :(
cool, thanks for the info (and u / grinningllama too). have a nice week end!
my favourite bakeries here are croquembouche on st-joseph, and anna pierrot on cartier (and i believe there's one in ste-foy). anna pierrot appears to have cheesecake; you may need to order one with cherry though
croquembouche (st. joseph street) and paillard (st. jean street) make good ones. la boîte à pain is also nice, but call them to ask if they do large ones if it’s what you want, because i usually see individual portions being sold (they have raspberry flavor sometimes i think). when it’s my birthday, i always get a little cheesecake from them. ☺️
try fendel & lilo. they make cheesecake balls - kinda the cheesecake equivalent of cupcakes. they have lots of different flavors, so you could get an assortment. only problem is they're a little out of the way, in one of the farthest suburbs from city center.
check out le truffé on pere-lelievre, they make amazing cheesecake and other dessert goods
if you're not downtown (or don't want to go there), there's also  they make a mean strawberry cheesecake, but maybe you could ask them for a cherry one.
maybe: 
thanks! i'll give them a call and see if they can make one.
i tried this a couple weeks ago. best cheesecake i got in my life.
thanks for the info! i had already checked them out (one of the few results google gave me) and they seem to have everything except cherry. i'll keep them in mind if i can't find exactly what i'm looking for though, they look great.
oh, what a coincidence. happy cake day! :)

coworking space? otherwise looking for a job closer to you?
coffee.
maybe a restaurant?
staying there, i would go to trait carré quite to take a forced break every 50 minutes to get some fresh air. anyway, it will be healthier for the brain (hint: i'm a former developer, i know how draining it can be).
i often go to the brûlerie sur saint-jean. they don't disgust me so that i consume full pine and it's full of people who work.
come at our home! we will tell each other jokes and we will do [fart farts] ( i stay two steps away. / semi-s
thanks for your suggestions.
conclusion: 
i went to the saint-roch roasting plant for today, i will test several places, but i am very interested in the concept of [cockpit.work] ( it costs a bit expensive but at the same time it will either cost me the equivalent in gas to go to a lot each day or to pay me a restaurant dinner every day to work in a cafe / restaurant where i cannot. not bring lunch, must pay for parking, etc.
it would greatly help my motivation, perhaps even to the point of starting again to do personal projects with the 3 hours of road that i am recovering.
me at the library i take off the mask at the table. did we tell you you couldn't?
i have a friend who rents a coworking place in the city center, [ marge( for sure $ 200 a month is still not give on the other hand.
there is no shortage of coworking space in limoilou and st-roch
in summer it is good by bike and in winter i imagine that it is not super long by bus.
who?
it takes me one that will have electricity, a quiet place and that will not force me to buy 18 coffees to spend the day there
cafe or restaurant i guess i won't have a choice, but which one. i will not eat all day either, otherwise i will be obese before the end of the pandemic
i have no breaks just 30 minutes not paying for dinner in a 9am shift.
i graduated in december i took what there was, having no experience.
i was going there too. either you sit at the counter in the glass or you sit at the tables upstairs. i could spend days there without nobody loathing me.
/ u / user_8804, check if you could take the 800 not far from your home to disembark at honoré-mercier next door. it would be less boring / expensive than looking for a parking lot.
i find that weird indeed, especially with the open restaurants it would be really inconsistent to force the mask in the library.
i didn't know it existed! it's interesting. 3 hours of driving per day costs more than that in gas.
wow that's interesting!
we should check if there is something like this closer to op's (in charlesbourg), but it's a good idea, indeed.
i know that there are free commercial premises in certain places, such as at the charlesbourg crossroads or in the building on henri-bourassa, opposite boulevard mathieu (or the asian restaurant and the campaign office of the outgoing mp, pierre paul -hus). op, you could call the owners and ask if you can * squat * a little corner, for compensation, at least until they find a tenant.
the bruleries (her in st roch and in ste foy) let me spend the day there when i just buy a coffee
maelstrom, la maison smith
half the day at home and the other half in a restaurant or café?
i'm curious about what you're going to do, because i'm really tired of telecommuting after 18 months on my own ……
dac, i'm going to sound captain obvious but don't stay there too long, they clearly don't deserve you and there is no shortage of it jobs, especially in quebec. code non-stop for 9 hours is not great.
curiosity like that, how do they control your "attendance"?
it's more the restaurant that is inconsistent. we know that the virus travels through the air, as long as you remove your mask, this is where the virus spreads. we let the restaurant do that because there is no other way to eat and we don't want the industry to go bankrupt.
the mask limits the spread, that's life.
perhaps castello, on the first avenue at the height of the rue des peupliers, allowed it too. it's closer to op.
ok i check that thank you
half and half is not crazy.
i wish it were that simple but it's not "just any it job" my area of expertise, and i'm coming out of major depression so i have a lot of anxiety about breaking the little stability i have. have acquired for the moment
i'm pretty much still in the office right now.
theoretically, not when i am at a distance unless i am "responsive". they see my web activity and the code i'm pushing.
obviously the yield if it goes down as soon as i am at home it is visible
not the op but you can see the apm (actions per minute) quite easily.
ok good luck and don't give up, it's temporary. it's cliché to say but it's true.
but if a youtube video is playing, does that matter?
i ask for a friend.
it depends on the tracking system. if it's monitoring the network, it's going to see traffic. but if he's watching your keyboard mouse actions, no.
thank you for the information!
you're welcome. if i may, if you are bored like that at your job, you should talk to your manager. there's nothing worse than getting paid for doing nothing for motivation and self-esteem.
have your qr code ready and your masks at hand and no one should give you any trouble
if you have an appointment at the hospital you need go get tested. apart from that, masks and qr code is all you need, anywhere.
just got here this afternoon- we went to a cafe for a glass of wine.
needed photo proof of our second vaccination and id.
i went on covid19.ontariohealth.ca to download my vaccine info.
holy shit the streets are steep!!
my girlfriend and i are currently visiting from ontario. we have been asked a few times to supply a picture (pdf) of our 2nd vaccination confirmation and photo id. no problems so far!
[removed]
just reading now that our ont qr code won’t be rolled out till mid october. does that mean no quebec city holiday?
thank you.
work those calves :)
that is why ebikes are getting popular. welcome to quebec city!
let's see how heavy you are
no room for this kind of comment.
places that ask for the vp will scan your qr code. i'm pretty sure you can print out a proof of vaccination and you might be able to work something out with it.
i am in quebec right now from saskatchewan. i just printed out vaccine confirmation (and saved a pdf on my phone) to show places that require it. that was basically the instructions given last week for out of province people visiting. it should be in english on the quebec government website by now, but there was a cbc article as well. if i have any trouble before i go home i'll make another reply to you!
you will need your proof of vacation that is more than 2 weeks old and and id with a picture on it and a proof of address (like your drivers license).
we've been around all week with paper cards from us vaccines. just have some documentation of both doses and you'll be okay.
strongly agree.
thank you so much! enjoy your stay
there is only one calèche left and the driver is retiring at the end of the season. hurry up if you want to do this.
certainly. you can opt for a buggy ride or a tour in a double decker "convertible" bus. the buggy ride is very informative bu6 also very expensive.
yep: double deckers 
wow. so many last time we were there. any idea how to book with the one remaining?
by buggy do you mean caleche or something else? would love more info. thank you!!!
thank you!!! looking into it now. love to see it's guaranteed top deck for safety
sorry i don’t know and i have seen him only once this summer.
there is now a big red bus with open top, you can up on in front of the château frontenac.
found this, not sure it still good: 
thank you! i had tried that one, shows no dates in august or september but could actually be sold out if it's just the one!
if you are downtown [l’atelier]( or [ophelia]( should have good salmon tartares.
[shaker]( is also good, with a younger crowd.
if you go near laurier, [kimono sushi bar]( is an all time best on sushi, i’d bet their tartares are fabulous. but since i only eat sushi there i never tested them ;)
if you are into super nice and fancy food, then check this one : 
thanks for the suggestions!! also, any recs for good wineries?
thanks!
riviere jacques-cartier in the [national parc]( is the only i know of.
it’s really beautiful! reservations a must!
rivière du gouffre in baie saint paul is perfect for that activity. but it is an 1h15 drive...
the same river but between pont-rouge and donnacona.
although for a family… maybe not.
might consider the ste-anne river instead (outside the canyon/rapids area).
for something a little outside the traditional touristy places and more in touch with nature, walk along the parc linéaire de la rivière saint charles, downtown. you don't need to walk its full length, there's bridges throughout so you can double back eventually. going south from the passerelle des trois soeurs takes you through a cute part of the saint sauveur neighborhood to rue st vallier, which you can walk back east to st joseph street. or you can loop around, there's paths on each side of the river. an interesting, stroller friendly morning or afternoon.
for dining with the family, if the weather is nice, the grand marché de québec is a market with tons of great shops. pick and choose cheeses, breads, fruit, and such, then eat it in the park outside which has a pretty great playground plus fountains for the kids to play in. very family friendly, and as adults you should find it fun to mingle with locals at the market.
go down to rue saint-joseph, via rue des remparts. look for benjo, its a fun toy store, they have a tiny door for kids and they use to have activities inside, like an indoor train and some other stuff. there is also a wide selection of restaurants, like poutineville! since its not in the touristy area you will find more reasonable prices also. from there you can walk back to the marina du vieux-port and follow the water around to cartier petit champlain, which is a must see and take the funiculaire back up to the chateau frontenac and go from there. hope you have a wonderful time in our city!
go to montmorency falls, must see. also someone recently posted this [great restaurants list]( on another thread. pretty exhaustive.
you'll be able to ask the front desk for recommendations as well.  
but there is the museum of civilisation near the waterfront of the old city core, i believe it is pretty kid friendly.
there are some boat tours.
take the kids on the ferry to the south shore (levi) to hang out on the waterfront/picnic, there is also a microbrewery there (corsair) that would be fine with kids.
les 3 brasseurs is a pretty great family restaurant. there are others on the grande allée.
i suggest you to go eat at casa calzone its close from riviere saint charles if you go walk there. probably the most pretty and delicious calzone you will eat.
thank you for the suggestion
thank you for the suggestion! if the train ride is still there then the kids will love it.
thank you for the suggestion.
i personally love the german christmas market and just walking around old québec at this time of year. hopefully there's snow for you :)
[deleted]
if you come from another country, i would wait a bit before purchasing air tickets. if you are in canada, then no worries. there's several activities around the holidays season, moreover they have a midnight new year eve like new york (not the same dimension obviously) but it's festive and really great for younger adults.
seeing as the provincial government is hanging on for dear life to the sanitary emergency status set 1½ year ago to rule without opposition from anyone and the pandemic isn't over yet (worldwide at least), i would not make plans and see them as set in stone yet, unfortunately.
as such, even we the locals don't know what will be possible or not six months from now.
hope the market will be better this year. it wasnt too great last year wuth all the restrictions.
great, thanks!!
>i’m not sure if the ice hotel will be ready by then
it usually opens around mid-january, so probably not ready in time for op's visit, unfortunately.
i used to work at the ice hotel and for the past 4 years, we've opened between christmas and nye. the thing is that not all rooms are ready before mid-januray. it's still a magical place to visit. bonus, there's a 30celius indoor waterpark and a spa right beside so it's perfect for post-ice hotel.
bora park, it's huge.to me those two extremes (bora park and ice hotel) are like as if vegas and disneyworld were blending but without the annoying blink.
ah! good to know, thanks for the info!
restaurants don't close on canada day, you should be good to eat pretty much anywhere.
most places are open on canada day, our big "everything is closed" holiday was last week on saint-jean-baptiste day. some museums could be closed though, you might want to check on their website just in case. have a good trip!
just so you know, we mostly use this day off to move (apartments, houses), since the vast majority of leases here are obligatory 12 months ending on july 1st. canada day is not widely celebrated here 
the real party is a week prior for québec's day (fête nationale)
there's still some stuff going on though. larger stores are mostly closed and you will have to rely on small grocery stores. it's no different than other provinces on that aspect. just have to plan for supplies. 
fun related stuff should be mostly opened. i believe cbc posts a list every year if you need an english version
almost everything is open.
thank you!
thank you!
the first time i moved from one place to another in ontario (after living my life in quebec), i naturally did it on canada day... and got the wierdest fk'n looks.. "well when else are you suppose to move" - literally any other day
thank you! i've heard about the big moving day, thought it was only in montreal
a local company, traduction sematos, offers this service.
if you are not in a hurry, there is the laval university student translation firm that can do it for a lower price (langulaire translations), but they are only active during university sessions.
otherwise, no choice to go through ottiaq and pay the price, they are the only ones who can provide an official translation.
for an official, certified translation, you need a translator approved by ottiaq.
who is it that requires you to translate your transcripts which are in english? i have never seen that since we are in a bilingual country.
+1 for sematos — indeed, i am their certified fr-an translator!

when i was little the duck galleries were already empty. i used to go with my great aunt / babysitter because she was doing her errands at the dollorama.
i was there last week with my girlfriend. it's completely abandoned.
cegep or uni?
at ulaval (10 years ago), the answer was yes to all these questions, but the proportions changed depending on the faculty. the bars in the city (with a few exceptions) are not very popular, usually academics go out to college bars and other association-related parties.
my senior millennial opinion: you should be more interested in the faculty of the faculty where you want to study than in parties. there are parties in all the universities, and more than you will have opportunities to go out. ie i would prefer to study engineering at udes or poly but my medicine i would do at ul.
if you want to party, you will find what you are looking for without any problem. it might take a little more effort depending on your ability, but nothing difficult.
i have too much privilege to comment adequately on diversity but from my biased perspective it seemed better than society in general.
no worries about the party. for diversity it will depend on the faculty, but it's quite limited if you compare to montreal, but it will be more than in the rest of quebec.
i would tell you that it depends on the program and the faculty. there are programs that are really big on the party and have a lot of activities while others are much more relaxed. for having studied at the faculty of science and engineering at ulaval, people are quite a part of the party and the community is really nice!
as for diversity, i would tell you that in my bac it was quite limited, but it is also because the number of people in my bac is not very high. there were a few homosexual people in my bac and they integrated well. people at college are open-minded enough to accept you for who you are regardless of your ethnicity or gender identity. you just have to participate in student life as much as possible and be nice and it should be okay! and also i advise you to participate in the initiation. it allows you to make friends quickly!
party, yes there are a lot of them. diversity, unfortunately not, especially in certain faculties (nursing, medicine, everything related to health sciences). you are also treated very differently at ulaval if you are a minority. this is something the university really needs to work on
to party is just to fuck everything crazy! with the covid you shouldn't go out, but and you gave birth haha the jewel of quebec is not good, town of leftists
i am at cégep and my boyfriend at uni! we are both in care
we are in nursing!
if i remember correctly, the baccalaureate at u-laval in nursing is pretty much alive.
i would have preferred a metro 😢
it seems clear to me that it must pass on the commercial avenues .. it will bring customers!
head east on the 4th, head west on the 3rd. call me solomon. : d
why not a tunnel under the 1st so that the population of the lower town would be as considered as that of the upper town. no discrimination based on socio-economic origin.
me too, but we don't really have the density for a metro. i think it could possibly do this to "bury" the tram.
i would have preferred a longer tunnel in the upper town anyway.
i could see the 3rd avenue closed to traffic very well. you could only get around it on foot, by bike or by tram.
but why ?
it's not like we can drive faster under the earth.
me too!
same
you don't have to follow the streets or stop at traffic lights underground.
i know that's not what you want to hear, but consider it: you don't need a realtor, even less so in quebec where commission-free sales are very common.
realtors are never free, you will end up paying thousands more.
realtors are not going to negotiate you a better price. in fact it's far more likely that they will tell you take an offer quickly since $5k or $10k is not going to change anything on their bottom line.
instead, spend that money to get your next home appraised and inspected by a professional.
look around val-belair area. they are used to deal with military and a large part of our forces speak only english as they move in quebec. if you have no luck dm me i will put you in contact with one i know.
bryan peladeau - he’s a delight and he is fluent in english. i bought my condo with him as my realtor. 
a friend of mine is a realtor, i asked him but he doesn't feel confident enough in english. will check with colleagues and friends.
[deleted]
i agree.  my boyfriend and i moved to québec from the gta (western ontario) in august 2020 and i was very hesitant to go it alone since i was purchasing my first condo.
i wasn’t selling property simultaneously, but going forward i would highly consider using [duproprio]( because i was not impressed by my real estate agent at all and kept feeling like i was doing most of the legwork myself.  i found the whole process to be nightmarish, though i think that’s mostly because the real estate market/process is so different in ontario and i was moving province-to-province.  i notice that so many people use duproprio in québec though, so there must be a reason!
*edit to include: i am a bilingual anglophone and could not find an english-speaking real estate agent.  i’d be happy to send you my research/documents though if it could help you!
*val-belair
thanks!
if i may, that "it's the seller that pays" is really bullshit. what money do you believe the seller uses to pay his realtor? the money from the sale. so the buyer adds in the money to pay both realtors on top of what the seller gets to keep. spin this however you want, the reality is, without realtors, you would pay x amount to the seller, and with realtors, you pay x+y, where y is the two commission fees. nothing in life is free.
now, is it worth your money or not, that can be debated.
i appreciate the perspective! i had the sense that they did more, and as this will be my first time i figured they provided more of a guided service. i’m generally more of a hands on person though, so i will definitely consider not using one. if you’re comfortable sharing your research i’d really appreciate it. thanks!
thanks
i disagree with those above. as newly weds, my husband and i moved from montreal two years ago and we were so lost and didn’t know the ins and outs of each sector and our realtor brought up so many good points that we didn’t even consider at first. for a huge purchase i don’t think it’s unreasonable to get help from someone who knows the city and the scene. that said, you can always dm me and i can share my experience.
for example: we were looking for a condo to buy because we thought that would’ve fit our needs but our realtor brought up the fact that there were too many new condos being built now in the area so down the line it won’t hold it’s value as much as one in montreal or a house would.

ghostly kisses sounds a lot like london grammar, at least for the few tunes i've heard.
when i say "ville de québec", i mean indie pop / rock musicians from the 6 districts of the provincial capital of quebec, beauport, la cité-limoilou, charlesbourg, la haute-saint-charles, les rivières and sainte-foy –sillery – cap rouge. no montreal artists, please. / when i say, "ville de québec", i mean indie pop / rock musicians from the québécois provincial capital's 6 boroughs of beauport, la cite-limoilou, charlesbourg, la haute-saint-charles, les rivières and sainte-foy – sillery –cap-rouge. no acts from montreal, please.
didn't know, nice
to know ? do we stay evasive?
not sure what the nightlife will be like, but the vibe you guys are probably looking for will be on la grande allée. nightclubs like dagobert, ozone or bar/restaurant l'atelier. 
nearby on cartier there is rideau rouge and blaxton. in the old city, there's a cocktail bar called alphonse, there's a chill pub in a beautiful spot called borgia, sapristi is a nice bistro for affordable drinks/food in a nice setting. 
on rue st jean there's le sacrilège (popular spot for students to drink), le projet for beers, nina pizza for wicked good pizza. 
in the lower city (home to more local nightlife) you've got maelstrom, la cuisine, deux22, district, macfly, phoenix, bureau de poste and a bunch of microbreweries.
if you make any earnest effort to speak even horrible french, anyone will walk on hot coals for you. 
poutineville or bâti bassak on stjoseph. nina pizza either place. 1640 in front of the chateau. cosmos on laurier. the list goes on...
i really like going at chez victor on st-jean. they make creative burgers, with an excellent quality for price. 
they have many restaurants in the city, but i feel the one on st-jean has the "quebec city spirit". maybe i am biased because i live 2min from there.
other than that, do you girl have common interests or things you would like to explore ?
vegan donation, post office, la bûche, la salsa, depend on what you looking for!
eat poutine. classic
praise my 6 years of french from elementary school will pay off so well thank you so much for responding.
thanks for bringing that up, that sounds like a great restaurant. one of the main reasons we are going because we wanted to go on a trip after school ended and drink lol. so we are definitely looking for pubs, bars, and  nightclubs maybe. we also wouldn't mind going on adventures exploring or going to historical sites as well since they like the old architecture of it as well.
you'll be at the right place, we have a lot of good bars and microbreweries here. i guess you'll probably stay in the city without a car, so i'll not talk about "outside" ones. i'd recommend (micros to pubs, my pref are with *) : noctem*, korrigane*, la barberie, le nelligan's , le ninkasi, le bureau de poste, le bateau de nuit*
for something more than just drink, i'm not an expert but i'd say probably le drag or les voutes de napoléon.
for architecture, the old quebec (upper and lower city) is the place. if you stay in the heart of the city you'll be close. (old québec and petit champlain)
it's so beautiful!
it's the tram, the monorail ... shall we take the bets? it will end at 4 or 5 billion and the operating costs will be so high that the taxes will have to be increased ...
3rd white elephant in 10 years with yqb and the videotron center.
hmm, mountains aren't close of the city just so you know. if you plan to bring them there and wait around, it might be difficult to find a place to have a cigar. however, if they go at stoneham or le relais, there's a lot of nice restaurants around. for cigars rooms, i think there's still one on grande allée but that's into the city.
stoneham is a 25 min ride from qc city. and mont-ste-anne is a 40 min ride from qc city. just lift them up over there and come back in qc to try one of our good restaurant. theres is plenty of suggestions in this sub. bon voyage.

thanks everyone!
it's boring
"do you agree with cancel culture?"
"critical race theory"?
has this poll been created by americans? sounds a lot like american talking points.
canadians = americans
edit: canadian-english, but for me that goes without saying
are we really? i haven't heard much about critical race theory around here yet. as for the "cancel culture" ... yeah ... i admit, a bit from some quebecor columnists, but it's still marginal, isn't it?
canadians ≠ quebecers
there are usually some owls and other stuff spotted at the parc around domain de maizerets. i've seen a barred owl, great horned owl and some northern saw-whet owls there.
also a bunch of other stuff there. it's a popular spot for bird watching.
les plaines d'abraham and parc des braves. you should also go at the cap-tourmente, it's outside the city but the ride is flat
edit: the linear park of the st-charles river is a must too
in the marais léon-provencher in neuville, you can spot some birds and the black-capped chickadees will usually come eat from your hand. it's a bit far though. there's another nice spot closer to the city, to the north : les marais du nord. there's a (small) entry fee though.
bois de coulonge and domaine maizerets
north of quebec in stoneham , there is le marais du nord wich is a great spot for birding. its a 10 min drive from quebec.
i m very familiar with the parc des braves, skip it.  too many squirrels.
similar to the not obvious bootlegger ... have you looked for the cache à maxime?
otherwise bbq biceps, different but excellent bbq experience!
va has nothing to do with the bootlegger but patent and thing is quite unique. i suggest you a place at the bar you have your nose in the kitchen, it's a small restaurant, the menu changes often (every day?) the atmosphere is cool, the staff great, in short it's our favorite restaurant on the good side relaxed atmosphere food.
don't forget to try their unemployed pudding and cheese, it's just sick!
bbq is a good idea. i'll watch it there. not necessarily the same, just a restaurant / activity that is out of the ordinary. thank you!
or his little brothers "the case is ketchup" and "the kraken cru". all excellent establishments.
but we are far from the bootlegger's dinner / show / entertainment / hotel experience.
yes excellent too! we are indeed elsewhere but given the number of suggestions i said to myself that it qualified haha
i think "london jack" might be an option,. as the name implies, it's a british themed fish n chips / indian place, and i'm pretty sure they posted about streaming the euro. not sure how much of a vibe there'd be though!
pub galway on cartier avenue
as others said, pub du parvis and london jack are good spots. also, la cage – brasserie sportive should broadcast euro
thank you for all the suggestions, do you guys/girls have any idea which would be the busiest? love a good atmosphere
pub du parvis right next to it is also a good spot
i strongly recommend atomik tattoo on myrand. ([ urbaine(
i would add that yes they are expensive, but it's really worth it because they are really good artists.
what do you mean by 'dear'? this would be my first tattoo and like i say i have a budget of $ 500. do you think that would be reasonable for an average tattoo? like 3in x 3in?
it depends. size is a factor, but quality and detail are also important. should ask tattoo artists directly.
quebec city is absolutely beautiful even just for the walks.
check out the montmorency falls, and ile d'orléans. many neighborhoods to walk through, rue st jean, rue st joseph, cartier, la promenade samuel de champlain and parc de la plage jacques cartier
best sushis in town is (for most people) at the metropolitain. it’s uptown on cartier avenue. fishing is fun on the st laurent river. biking. if they are open, a lot of good restaurants here.
tokyo sushi on st-jean is appreciated as well
what makes a good sushi to you ?
if you're more of a purist, enzo on rené-lévesque will be your place. if you prefer more fusion styles my favourite is miyagi bistro in limoilou.
best sushi is [miyagi bistro]( hands down. a bit pricier than run of the mill sushi but their chef's choice often have exotic selections, are fresh, and just excellent. the miso is awesome too.
if most things are still closed (i sure hope it won't), there are many, many places you can go for walks. many have recommended places here in the other comments. i'll second some recommendations and add some i don't think i've seen :
- the old city itself and its streets are 100% worth a day or two to walk around, even if we weren't in a pandemic i'd still recommend it
- some neighborhoods have either historic or nice looking sectors, like the *trait-carré* in charlesbourg, some old parts of beauport, sillery, cap rouge near the marina (and the chocolats favoris another commenter recommended), from there you can also walk in a trail right up to the bridges...
- the montmorency falls
- the orleans island
- the jacques-cartier national park
- cap tourmente (about 30-40 minutes drive from downtown)
- ste-anne canyon
- old lévis and along the river on the south shore (and go by ferry, you'll get the nicest possible view of quebec city)
i doubt it'll be possible, but nicky sushi, in limoilou, has a "sushi river". you sit at the counter and look at the small boats filled with sushis passing by. once you see one that interests you, you pick it and eat them. you'll get charged depending on how many boats you pick. fun experience!
if you have a car, you can also go for an ice cream from chocolats favoris at cap rouge. it's quite pretty.
thank you so so much....i'm drooling in anticipation
for sushi, masaru sushi are really good and not that expansive! tokyo sushi was already suggested, but i can only agree that the sushis are good!
for what to do, june is a wonderfull time to walk and enjoy the sun. you can go to plaines d'abraham for a walk and enjoy a beer/wine/wathever you like while seeing the fleuve saint-laurent. you can also walk by the st-charles river, its near downtown and limoilou, two great place for restaurants and stores (with hope that they will be open!). 
you could also go to the lévis side with the ferry. you would have a great view of the château frontenac and there is some water games at quai paquet (jeu d'eaux in french, not sure how to translate that). usuallly, there is some food truck and if so, try a chocolate dipped ice cream from chocolat favoris (it is si gooood!!!). 
have fun :)
hopefully, in june it is going to be a bit more open. i'm hopeful particularly near the end of the month around the st-jean-baptiste.
best sushi place, best all you can eat is shogun sushi on quatre-bourgeois.
best in terms of quality is hard to tell but i usually order from shogun sushi on boulevard laurier.
great ideas, thanks so much 🤗
thanks..... we 😘
i like tokyo, but i wouldn’t recommend it. it’s dirty and cheap.
yummmmmmm 🍤🍣🍱
i live in london on so we have authentic everything asian except sushi so l will try them all out undoubtedly ... thanks
btw thankyou for being a front line worker!!🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
thank you...hubby doesn't let.me have it at home so i'll be having a feast while there.  🍱🍣🍤
we were there last fall and walking around the old part and we were the only people down there between 8 and lunch time.  but extra places to go are so appreciated ... we  had the city shut down at midnight that night and had no idea where to go. 
thanks, i 😘
x2 for the ice cream.
sounds like my trip to tokyo... great ideas, thanks....
>you can also walk by the st-charles river, its near downtown and limoilou
it has a portion there, yes, but the *parc linéaire* is 32 km long and goes all the way up to the st-charles lake north-west of charlesbourg. that complete back and forth trek could be 2 days worth of walking.
thank you!! hopefully they deliver!
janet
shogun also has all you can eat sushi (if you can eat on site)
i've been there multiple times and never thought it was dirty. and it's the only sushis byob in town. or is nicky byob as well?
you do you girl ;)
32 km is 19.88 miles
our hotel is too expensive to spend a night on the trail...lol.
maybe a short day hike....
shogun is on uber eats that i do know 😊
next time you’re there, pay close attention to the area behind and around the cash register. the walls are stained with years-old splatter. it is cluttered with dusty piles of paper. if you take a peek behind the dirty looking curtain leading to the kitchen, you’ll see a dirty floor with trash and boxes of produce laying on the floor. 
i have a friend who was delivering produce there. he told me the backyard was covered in dog shit. not exactly clean imho. they’ve been fined numerous times by the mapaq. 
i still go sometimes because it’s cheap, and it’s always busy so the fish is probably fresh, but it’s not exactly up to high grade japanese cuisine. the owners and staff are not japanese either. 
if you want some traditional sushi, try hosaka-ya. the price is right, it’s fresh and clean, and the sushi is made with love by japanese people.
hubby once said ... so that's what going down on a girl must taste like...i almost choked. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
i don't think anyone walks it all in one go, i was just saying the park extends well past downtown. ;-)

you should check with them :
a smaller company might not have english workers here in quebec city...
i don't know which one offer service in english, but i'm sure you can find such ressources on the *anglophones living in quebec city* facebook group or somewhere on veq (voice of english-speaking quebec)'s website (or calling them).
thanks for that
i thought it was chilly this morning! (or maybe that's me not wearing a scarf...) either way, i absolutely love your updates, thanks so much!
so there's around 25% (1 in 4) chances that the coldest day of the year is between jan 16 and feb 5. 
let's go buy some wood!
the quebec aquarium offers reception rooms with a catering service and a bar if you are interested. i don't know the prices in particular but it could be interesting for you
all hotels have this kind of room. otherwise, the nave in st-rock, the museum of fine arts, the morrin center, the fairgrounds (several rooms of different sizes, not just the large rooms used during fairs), the church basements, the community centers (lucien-borne, loisirs montcalm, loisirs lebourgneuf, ymca, ywca, etc.), etc.
you could try restaurants or bars - i know pub st. patrick has a function room (no idea if it's suitable for your needs).
the morrin center.
if you haven’t yet try calling during normal business hours and asking to be transferred to meetings/events  staff. sometimes emails quickly get buried in busy inboxes.
thanks!!

\ +1 for krwn. i've had my hair cut there for several years at the ste-foy / st-roch shop and i've always had good cuts
it's a bit toxic as a place though. i stopped going because the jokes of child violas was too much. not to mention the shady barbers got called during the me too. it's a shame because they are really good.
i know how to do a google search, i was looking more for recommendations.

i heard great things about the quebec dodgeball league from members of the english-speaking community of quebec
look where the dek hockey games are being held, you should be able to find other adult sports leagues in the gyms they go to.

université laval has leagues. i don't know if you have to be an alumnus or what, but i played it years after i graduated there.
there are plenty of local "senior" (18+) hockey leagues depending on where you live!

quebec dodgeball league. beautiful, very welcoming gang!
thank you!
thank you!! i actually did my masters there so i think it can work
perfect. just inform you at peps.
there aren't really any all-inclusive resorts in the québec city area. closest thing you can get to a resort is [le bonne entente]( specifically the luxurious getaway package or fairmount gold at the [château frontenac]( 
if you're ok with losing the benefit of included food & drinks then i would personally recommend [le capitole]( i visited it recently and the rooms are fantastic and it's just outside the old city walls if you're wanting to visit there.
otherwise for restaurants you really can't go wrong with most places inside the fortifications. my specific recommendations would be [aux anciens canadiens]( if you're looking for traditional québec food or [il matto]( if you're into italian food. there are so many restaurants in québec city so you can ask the front desk of whatever hotel you end up choosing for other recommendations.
most of these places are fairly costly, but i'd imagine that it isn't really an issue since you were looking for an all-inclusive type place to begin with.
there is an all-inclusive resort opening up this december - [club med charlevoix]( at the base of le massif de charlevoix. you can even take a [train]( directly to le massif from quebec city
there is also the [fairmont manoir richelieu]( towards la malbaie, not an all-inclusive but a very nice getaway.
strom spa nordique is great for romantic getaway
thank you for your time and in depth answer, it's very helpful! i'll be sure to look into it!
yes, you can easily find taxis at the airport.
there's also a bus route directly from the airport, if that's more your thing!
it's a small airport but there's always taxis waiting for customers.
taxis are flat rate from the airport to your hotel.  we had great cab rides to and from.
uber ftw!
thank you!
thank you very much! this would be a nice way to get into the city and see the area.
i worked in fermont and took the plane every two weeks, i can confirm to you who does not always have a taxis
i genuinely love the rtc. they've got two apps (both work in english) called rtc nomade (for up to date timings and the like) and rtc paiement (for buying bus tickets). as a rule of thumb, the 800 series are the most efficient and frequent bus routes, and the 76 joins up with the 800, 801, 804 and 807. if you're looking for a specific route, you're best off using google maps though.
oh yeah, you surprise me there but good to know! do you miss the wall? :)
this is perfect! you have a better bus service than the one in my area. it is amazing you can buy bus tickets on an app. i really appreciate the information.
...you've just changed my life. i didn't know about the paiement app! <3
not so much, i was going there just to do the ipicirie. i was staying in a wonderful mobile home.
i discovered the app during covid. way more helpful than having to go buy ticket in a store. there are also day and week passes, which might suit your needs better. the system isn't perfect, but you can certainly make it work. if you're visiting old québec, routes 800, 801 and 807 stop by place d'youville, and routes 1, 11, and 25 go inside the walls. for the chute montmorency, the 800 is your best bet.
it's relatively recent. it's been great! i’d warn though that it does not synchronize *at all* with an opus card or abonne-bus. i filed the papers to qualify as a student on the opus card, but that hasn't transfered to the app. same thing with the abonne-bus. on the plus side, i haven't had to worry about transfers so much: want to take the 13 there and back? no problem! afaik, they don't check for return trips, which is real nice.
yeah i guess: d i would still like to go there once, or visit the far north.
after using google maps i found i need to take the 11 to get close to our hotel after the first bus from the airport. will definitely use the bus to get to other areas outside the walls now.
the app was launched during covid.
sweet! i only take the bus occasionally and often have to swing by the dep beforehand to pick up tickets.
go on a manna trip, take the 389, camp on the belvedere at manic, then stop at uapiska for a little camping, then hop to mont harfang. you take the road again and stop when you see water and you fish. bring your kayak and go for a stretch on the fisherman's river. returned to fermont visit the mines and hike to the seversons mountains. visit the wall and go eat at baba-q in labrador city. there's even a canadian piggy bank there! isn't that cool?
yay! i’m not particularly familiar with the 11, but it seems to go by relatively frequently. if you want a couple of interesting stops along the way, there's the parc du bois-de-coulonges (and plains of abraham). maguire and cartier are also two really nice commercial streets if you want to check them out. i hope you enjoy your trip, and feel free to ask if you have any more questions!
that'd explain it!
you can buy individual tickets on the app 😉
or 20 for a cheaper rate if you take the bus more often. 
i seriously love not having to figure out where to buy tickets anymore!
it would be great but it would take me a subaru!
thank you! we usually picnic in the plains of abraham when we visit. i will check out maguire and cartier though. it's our first time coming to the city without our dog so we are doing all the museum's and the citadel this trip.
hmm, annoying. usually sports ads will present soccer matches on sunday pm. i would still try a boston pizza.
not a pub, but certainly the cage.
blaxton or galway on cartier probably. if not, london jack on st-joseph.
ah, i hadn't thought about football ... thank you for the heads up!
they don’t most people including me are too dumb to bother wearing one. i’m not aware of a helmet rental service but you could find on facebook marketplace for cheap. 
le comptoir emmaüs in st-roch?
otherwise there may be containers in some places for donations, a few people could probably tell you where they are.

ok thanks!
ostia that it is settler this affair
tse .... chu go the other day with a friend. it was the asylum. a real step back in time pre-covid. with a live show on the stage, and the mass of course, fully focused directly in front of them. no distance for 2 cents, the world shoulder to shoulder as if we were at feq. i couldn't believe it. i am staying away, shaking my head, surprised, shocked and greatly disappointed with us as a people.
there are surely some who will ask me what i expected ... i had no expectations beyond wanting to relive a very small slice of pre-covid normality, to listen to a bit of good latin music. .. but oh that i got late.
the city is absolutely gorgeous that time of the year, you will not regret it.
if you don't have a car, try something next to the"vieux québec". the first time i visit the city i staied at "le manoir des remparts" and it was pretty good. the city has a love/hate relation with airbnb, so i don't know how good the options are.
also, the province of quebec is stablishing a mandatory "vaccination passport" for some places and activities, so if you guys are not vaccinated it may be better to get your shosts before coming.
with 250$ a night, you will be able to stay directly on the grande allée or inside the walls. that's more than enough for qc city. try this one :
do you feel like you need a kitchen to prep meals ? if not, go for a hotel
to add to this, $250 a night is plenty.  i rent a room in my apartment for $50 a night on airbnb.  if you go with a well-reviewed host, you can't go wrong.  some airbnbs are actually better than some hotels.
chateau laurier is great !

mannnnn there so much rivers and waterfalls that you can swim on in the area of québec, its just amazing... but you have to know them... i have two suggestions for you: the jacques cartier river in shannon have wonderful sand islands but its a bit crowdy in the week-end. or go to the jacques cartier national park, there is plennty of quiet spots upstream. have fun
on the mestachibo trail, there is a waterfall. it is a multilevel waterfall with little basins of water, do not swim in those (prohibited, especially since a girl has died, don't think they recovered the body). however, it may be possible to swim at the base of the waterfall. the mestachibo hike is really nice and follows a river that you could swim in.  
on a side note, there are two ways to get to the waterfall (i think it's called chute st anne). the stairs are the fastest to access its base, but they are in real bad shape and officially they are closed. might be best to do the small walk/hike to the base of the falls.
none that i know of. the falls around here are mostly touristic, and swimming in the lakes and rivers around them is prohibited
there's a parc easy to access where you can get your feet wet near a waterfall, perfect for pictures. it's free if you want to check it out :
armand-grenier park
that sounds wonderful! i think that's where we'll go, thank you :)
do you know if it's "prohibited" or actually prohibited? i know a few places near montreal that have the swimming prihibited signs but its because there are no lifeguards and people go in anyway
prohibited as in you'll die if you go swimming there.
there's very few falls around here. they're touristic because they're basically terrifyingly strong currents and not secluded at all. if you're looking for a secluded spot with some falls, you might be out of luck.
that said the falls around here are very nice.
ah yeah not ideal. oh well, we'll either visit the falls without getting wet or go somewhere else. all good. thanks for the info :)
if you wanna get wet, 
haha not super down for waterpark vibes, thanks though :)
i'm not aware of any part of the city where you can't go with a motorcycle maybe except for the 4 streets where cars have been restricted for pedestrians use only... i don't think the parking would be free but you should be able to park close to where you want to go. there's a big parking lot at "carré d'youville" another one near the city hall and one in front of "musée de la civilisation". i've seen many motorcycles there in the past and you still can park in a street if you find place.
you can park right there 46,7967539, -71,2325681, it's a motorcycle exclusive parking, the entry is small and partially hidden. that's a nice spot that right on top of gilmour hill. 
btw, watch out, there a lot of place in vieux québec that you can't go in motorcycle (like porte saint-louis)
how was your trip? i brought my motorcycle up here from vermont. any recommended roads to check out in quebec? parc national de la mauricie looks like it has some decent twisties
you might have seen motorcycles there but op is right that the walled city is officially off-limits for motorcycles. there are signs near all the gates and streets that give access to the old city. the people you've seen were just lucky to not be given a ticket.  
city hall is therefore entirely out of the question as a parking place for motorcycles.
is it relatovely safe?
so i got here. i noticed folks just park their bikes at bike racks and there are some bikes parked on the street and parking lots around old city. my bike is very loud so i parked just outside the wall.
you should definitely go to the island besife quebec city. though i noticed quebec in general is very hostile to motorcycles. there are warning signs and ban signs against motorcycles everywhere.
in that case, the parking lot at place d'youville would be the closest one?
yess, a lot.
yes i drove to orlean island yesterday, very nice! i haven't yet been to old town quebec yet but thanks for the heads up
and the one i would recommend. inside, with staff around, a few steps from the gate...
interested
wow that didn't take long ;)
have been having fireworks almost every night recently. nothing too stressful.
unless it lasted more than 2 minutes, it could just be crowded with fireworks at victoria park.
also heard in lower town! seemed to actually be more than two, three amateur firecrackers.
i heard it yesterday in lower town, pretty sure it was a keveun having fun with his [antilag] (
he was in the corners of pointe-aux-lièvres and limoilou
not far from 5 minutes and it sounded much more intense than a guy with his convenience store lights.
oky, that means nothing to me at all and it is indeed a long time for convenience store fires: d
hmm i think you would have more chances to dig linkedin profiles, this sub is not very big.
i worked for one of the unions and i have little good things to say to you. it depends a lot on the manager you are going to have and he may change ...
i worked in a more admin side and we are often left to ourselves. it will depend on your manager.
i just hear negtive or almost in the corner where i am. people talk about others a lot.
if you are looking for a professional challenge, supervision and efficient processes, the ciusss is not the right place, look elsewhere.
i have already been an employee of the ciusss-cn, but not in the same field. i think it depends on your priorities and what you want. there are definitely advantages (salaries, group insurance) and disadvantages (feeling like a number ... etc) to working there. you can come talk to me privately to discuss it if you want!
i told myself that i would give it a try! but thank you, it's a good idea.
that's kind of what worried me. thank you for your answer.
the blue foot on st-joseph. i believe they deliver
"quebec charcuterie platter delivery" if it exists, you'll find it on google
not sure if they deliver, but you could always try calling :
[
they have very nice selections. or :
[
sobab on 3rd avenue ... it is very well priced.
otherwise, nektar, much more expensive but i didn't drink better coffee
go to the cafes company and you will have a selection from quebec
there is also saint-henri, then la place sells le corsaire coffee (i like their davy jones coffee). both are on st-joseph e.
a little late, but take a look at julie's cafes!
sobab, tatum, nektar, castello are all very good and fresh but the best is at smith.
i was going to do the same answer
probably at gosselin at place de la cité.
zone 5 photo (leclerc camera) on bouvier! the bests!
thanks gang
i would try emmaüs
there are also drop box around the city
if you do not mind driving: armée du salut on boulevard hamel. 10 minutes at the very most.
on the same note, i have a bagful of jeans pants that teared between the legs, where should i go to responsibly dispose of them?

yeah, second that.

> 3. which vehicles are covered by the obligation to be equipped with winter tires?
motorized road vehicles registered in québec, other than a heavy vehicle, a tool vehicle or an agricultural machine, but including mopeds and motorcycles, must be equipped with winter tires. this obligation also applies to such a vehicle offered for hire regardless of its place of registration.
> 8. are vehicles from outside quebec affected by this measure?
no, except certain rental vehicles. the legislative provision applies to motorized road vehicles registered in quebec, other than a heavy vehicle, a tool vehicle or an agricultural machine, as well as to these vehicles offered for rental in quebec (regardless of where they are registered) .
source: [
tl;dr (and tl;dt):
if your car doesn't have a québec license plate, you don't need winter tires.
i would still advise caution. driving in québec's winter is unpredictable and can be highly dangerous if your car is not equipped with dedicated winter tires (not four seasons).
even if not mandatory i suggest you use winter tires. you really don't want to be invited to the summer tire club annual winter meeting.
not sure about visitors, but they are legally required on dec 1st.
i would not come here by car in the winter without winter tires though.  bring a candle, blankets, food, etc. in the car, too.  it is no joke if you get stuck on a highway.
québec city is build on a hill, you know, for better visibly to shoot cannons at oncoming english boats! if there is snow or ice at all, i would be very careful using anything other than winter tires. i did do it once when i bought a new car, from the dealership to my home and then to the garage, just a few kilometers. compared to driving with winter tires it was scary, i felt on the edge of control at all time, i had next to no breaking power anywhere there was any ice. if it has not snowed yet, which is possible at the end of november, it should be fine if you don't have any emergency breaking to do. otherwise, yeah be careful. to answer your question, its not legally mandated if you don't have québec plates.
not for vehicles registered outside quebec. 
but the law isn't there just for fun. driving with summer (or even 4 seasons) tires in quebec is dangerous. the loss of tire grip on the road makes it a very different ball game with regards to breaking distances, speeds, slope management, etc. 
driving with winter tires when you're experienced driving in the winter is already a challenge in itself. doing it in summer tires, without experience, is asking for troubles.
it's probably even more dangerous at the start and end of winter, because temperatures tend to go over 0°c in the day, so everything melts; then they dip below 0°c when the sun goes down, so everything turns to ice.
not legally mandated for visitors.
buuuuut, i wouldn't risk driving on summer tires in early december for my own safety.
winter tires are a requirement as of december 1st in québec city. although i would recommend getting them earlier since we tend to have snow already
i just want to put emphasis on this. we are all experienced drivers in extreme winter conditions here and we still think it's extremely dangerous to drive without winter tires. 
if you do it regardless here are my tips to drive without winter tires on snowy roads, drive slow you feel like you have control until you don't have any. do not touch your brakes if you start sliding, if you absolutely have to slow during sliding, prefer compression/engine braking if you have a manual car. do not change speed during a curve, do it before and after. prefer highways (we have a full grid), and stick to the right, as city streets may not have visible lines and it can be extremely confusing to follow us in our "lane guessing". 
if the rosd has a thin coat of snow, offset a bit and drive in the snow instead of the clear trails. the snow on those trails has melted, and possibly frozen into black ice. it's much more unpredictable. 
keep in mind it's not just about the snow and ice, but temperature. your summer/"all season" tires will be frozen hard starting from under 7 degrees celsius and will not behave the same way at all. your braking distance will be much longer.
if you are going down a slope (basically all the time here), brake early, you might not be able to brake at the bottom.
0°c is equivalent to 32°f, which is 273k.

us issued vaccination card along id will be accepted.
great, thank you so much.
i'd advise to get a digital "vaccine passport" on your phone as well. when you are traveling it is best to have backups for things that are essential like vax pass. loosing a wallet or bag could turn your vacation into a nightmare. if you are driving you would be able to come back into the us but you would not be able to fly, eat inside of a restaurant, go inside shops, or attend indoor events.
if you have android, google pay "gpay" and samsung wallet both have a digital vax passport. i'm not sure on iphone what apps but i know there are option for them on iphone
huh! thanks so much. i didn't even know i could do that. new york state (where i am) has a state-sponsored "excelsior" vaccine pass, but that's only for ny residents and i was living in another state when i got my vaccine so i can't do that. i will look into these other options. thank you!
if you haven't already, you can consult the [website of the professional order of psychologists.]( their website can provide you with a list of professionals that have the specialties you are looking for. you may find someone available to take you on quickly. heads up, i wasn't able to look any up in english, it reverts back to french. but i'm sure you can add english as a keyword.

it’s a nice event but it really is a drop in the bucket for the residents there’s enough stuff to do. it’s not a game changer for us it’s a fairly new event organized by local hero peter simon’s wife (i don’t know her name) anyway no big deal not to see that
it's a cute sight but it's just a market, a farmer's market with people selling homemade stuff like food, decorations, clothing.
anything you can find at the christmas market, you can find in other local shops.
this. if you are looking for specific things, you can shop online or at other local shops. the christmas market is nice and pretty, but usually cold as hell with too much people around you. it decreases the level of fun.
i like [bati basaac] ( on saint-joseph but i don't know if they deliver to charlesbourg. my favorite is their thai soup with shrimp.
bati basaac is pretty much the best. i have tried everything quite a bit. the worst was lotus select in my opinion. another good asian option in quebec is seriously lacking.
chez thao restaurant
on the delivery side, my favorite is the lotus d'ankhor on louis xiv!
best of all is the erawan on mcguire by the way ... more expensive, but it's really good.
i really like [tokio] ( i know they deliver with an app (i don't remember if it's with uber or doordash).
restaurant chez mai on 1st avenue in limoilou! best won ton soup i have ever eaten, among other things (the broth they use is perfect) i have never been disappointed!
the [lotus sélect] ( in cambronne is one of my favorites! they're on uber eats et al, if they ever make it to your place.
thank you all, i'm testing erawan and bati basaac one of these 4 and i'll tell you what i think!
thank you i watch this!
ouin erawan is pretty much a check mark above everything.
i have a colleague of my wife who takes care of a community garden.
5 years minimum.
5-6 years
where did you find this?
i even emailed the city but they direct me to a page that doesn't answer my question. = /
the experience
i confirm; the waiting period is long, about 5 years. often with priority to residents of the district where the said garden is located.
montreal is a bilingual city, but not quebec city. just do your self a favor and throw your self in to the french. your lessons will improve and you’ll progress faster. and you’ll pick it up. the touristy areas of quebec city are mainly english speaking. you are moving there so you should learn the french. and i think you’ll find many people willing to help you out. just put your self out there and it will come - especially if you are working at it. you’ve got this - good luck!
i spent all of september in qc. i am jealous you get to move there. such a wonderful place and will always have my heart. enjoy!
look for the website of voice of english quebec if you are looking for a job, they might help: 
there may not be a good market for a creative class in english in quebec city though.
for performance arts, you should contact the people at le lieu, they organize all kind of events.
enroll in a class at ulaval maybe?
art grads study at la fabrique which is downtown.
move downtown, moving in ste foy near the university can easily create a feeling of isolation since the neighborhood lacks a bit of life.
the knockout on st-joseph. this is the best place.
explosive groove in downtown limoilou is very nice. the owner is very knowledgeable also. its located at 1201 first avenue. you can check the open hours on facebook. their website work wonder too. have fun buddy!
i am english.
fantastic! it's on the same route to my airbnb!
i saw them online, but it looked more to be sort of jazz and soul type stuff. do they have a decent selection of rock/metal as well?
they don't have a ton of black metal but this is where they keep the most. there's an explosive groove but it's a little further and i don't think he keeps a lot of black / death.
indeed its much more jazz/soul oriented. but, they have some good albums in the categories you’re seeking. not all the times cause they fly quickly off the shelves. in any case it’s always fun to browse in person.
sounds good! i'll put it on the list.
the city does not really clear snow in winter yet, i had read about a pilot project to remove snow from the linear trail of the saint charles river and finally it was only groomed last year.
for the walk, i don't know, but in the upper town, the vélo-boulevard was cleared of snow last winter.
with mega-winter tires otherwise definitely not reliable
basically restaurants and shopping malls for boxing day.
there’s always something open except on the 25th you probably gonna eat fast food. for national parks i don’t think so but ski resorts are open
nothing is open on dec. 25 or 26th.
restaurants should be open 26th to 28th. shopping every day except the 25th. other than that, ski hills and national (read provincial) parks are open for outdoor recreation. if the snow is good, christmas day is the perfect time to go skiing if that's your thing.
are smaller shops likely to be open on boxing day? or mostly just the larger chain stores?
>are smaller shops likely to be open on boxing day? or mostly just the larger chain stores?
each year, we take a long walk in le petit champlain on boxing day. it is open and there is a great vibe. i would recommend staying in the city instead of the suburbs to have some restaurants open.
there is the facebook group glanage / dumpster diving * ville de québec
sauteed rabbit on petit champlain street
il teatro in place d'youville. chez boulay on st-jean street. enjoy your stay.
thank you!
september is a bit crazy weather-wise.
you can have days close to 90 degrees for a week, then have crazy cold nights (35-40), then go back to hot temperatures. it's been exceptionnally warm in the last few years, though. it's been a while since i've seen snowfalls in quebec city in september (but it did happen quite a while when i was younger).
you'll want to bring a mix of everything. t-shirts, sweaters, shorts, long pants and a jacket that will keep you warm if it gets chilly, just in case.
thank you all for your help. sounds like i’ll be packing my whole closet!!  i am so excited to experience your beautiful city!
it is difficult to answer. meteo is really inconsistent. temperature can drop 20+°c in less than 24h.
usually i'd say temperature is between 10 and 25°c at this time of year. nights can be more chilly though.
dress in layers, you'll be taking them off during the day. cold nights turning into summer afternoons gradually
as others said it really depends, but i find that even when it is hot during the day, it gets really cold in the morning and at night compared to summer months.
get a winter coat and some snow shoes. this is canada you know. and bring tools to build your igloo.
i kid.
september is pretty nice. the august heatwaves are gone and the temperatures cool down a bit. you'll be fine during the day in a t-shirt or maybe a hoodie, but it might get a bit chilly in the evening. like around 20c or maybe a little less later in september. so a little jacket could help.
i hope you enjoy your time here but yeah, pack your whole closet :d
you scared me before i realized you were joking. ha! thank you for this. i will be bringing a mix of everything - including winter boots :)
haha! i definitely will. i don’t want to be caught off guard
no need for winter boots! it won't be that cold ;)
looks like it could be in the mid 50’s at night. so i may bring a pair that’s not totally obnoxious. but thank you for responding.
five days doesn't seem like a lot to me. a good deal of home research is done on the internet, so it would be strategic to get ahead, at least to get a feel for the market. i admit that i do not have much experience looking for an apartment as a student, but in my experience it is common to visit accommodation that is to be rented for a little later and not immediately. for example, two years ago, when i arrived in quebec, i had to take a temporary apartment because i was between montreal and quebec for a few months, and i visited a small studio around mid-december. for a rental in january. it was around $ 800, all inclusive. the cheapest i saw was around $ 600, but it was lousy and there were few services in comparison. everyone is different, but personally i am not enough of a cowboy to arrive in a city with the pressure of finding accommodation for the year in a few days.

if you've been keeping up with the news, the river has an unusually high flow at this time of year. we observe a very strong current and pieces of ice that break up upstream. it's quite reckless of them to venture there, knowing that there are drownings pretty much every year in the river.
in the summer, the city rents boats from the nearby outdoor center, and there are lots of people swimming in the area. but in summer, the water level is much lower, about 2 meters lower than what you see in the photos, and the current is weaker.
the cannot is just for the summer!

try to book a table at the buvette scott. highly recommend this small restaurant. one of the best food in town. 
i recommend you scroll the sub as the majority of the posts are similar questions, you will find many more suggestions that way.
we need a tourism wiki, we're just lazy
awesome i will do that i had a quick question from someone in quebec maybe you can help with someone recommended us this
is this market free? i highly doubt it but i can’t seem to find tickets
do you have some time to list the answers given over the years and summarize them in a wiki? i can give you the rights to do it.
usually the market is free to enter. then, exposers sells goods, usually local products and hot wine.
last year due to covid, there were no exposers so it wasn’t as fun as pre covid.
hopefully it’s gonna be like before because german market is usually really really fun
it *is* free to visit. and i second that recommendation, the german market is awesome!
this week no luck, i continue to work even in the bathroom.
in a few weeks i could contribute, there in the juice
awesome thank you so much so excited

walk around, have french onion soup and drinks at pub l'oncle antoine or pub borgia, museum's, tours...
really depends on what you are interested in, if you staying within the walls, and how long you are there for.
there are good escape rooms in quebec city (cabinet mysteriis, sauve qui peut, à double tour, sos aventures, exode) and nice spots where you can play board games while eating and drinking (la revanche).
the end of november may be grey and wet. it may be best to limit planning outdoors activities, since there can be snow or not.
ok thank you!
thanks!
health!
so hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the nightlife isn't really back to normal here. the pandemic was hard on a lot of businesses and they have reduced hours, some only open on thursdays to sundays. there is no dancing at clubs yet, no karaoke. there are live shows at places like l'imperial on rue st-joseph, probably have to buy the tickets in advance. the museums are open, you've got mnbaq or musée de la civilisation.  
[i wrote a comment on a similar thread, with some places to check out]( one place i didn't mention on that thread is the diner st-sauveur. great late-night joint for drinks and food. there's also chez tao which has wicked cocktails and is normally a cool place to eat, drink and socialise.
this site (in french) has an event schedule for the city. you can put the url in google translate.
november isn't exactly the best time to visit the city unfortunately there isn't a whole lot happening.
later this winter there will be fun stuff for tourists, such as the winter carnival (carnaval de québec)
as for nightlife, saint joseph street is most likely to be alive on week days with district, shaker, deux 22, etc.
 the shaker in sainte foy or atelier in grande allée could also be lively.
the biggest club is the drag, an lgbt place on saint jean street. we have a bajillion microbreweries
there are also some live music places (phoenix is most likely to be alive on week days, but voûtes de napoléon/la piazz could also be alive.
there are several pubs on rue cartier, the rideau rouge there might be lively on week days.
as a recent transplant here myself, i'd recommend hitting up the bars on rue st jean. bar sacrilrege is fun and stays open until 3. if you're into beer, this city is heaven.
hey, thanks for the response! sucks to hear we won’t be able to dance it out but i’m sure we’ll find more fun stuff to do. on your other comment you mentioned there’s a few nightclubs open around, would they be functional tomorrow night or tuesday night?
no problem, still lots of fun to be had and the city is beautiful to explore. the phoenix is open, but their nightclub midnight blue is only open friday and saturday from what i can tell on google. the dagobert on la grande allée opens from thursday to saturday, it might be about the same story for the other nightclubs.
yes there are a few small trails nearby, i am thinking of the paths of the walk in levis for example which also offers more accessible routes. they are almost all listed on this map: [ marge(
pro tip: from the city center, you can reach the paths of the mill by bike by taking the bus 801 to the terminus. it remains far but it saves 30min and 200m of elevation
mountain biking is booming in quebec. i don't do it but look at these places:
mount saint anne
north arm valley
stoneham
a car will help you, but you can rent or carpool.
if you don't have a car, look on trailforks and rent an apartment near val-belair or st émile, it is served by the bus and access to trails
otherwise, sdm, empire, msa it takes a car
thanks a lot man
> the leader of quebec 21 waived this convention tuesday when he invited the media to a press conference in connection with support for his candidacy, including that of former hockey player alain côté.
i'm sure we're going to persist for 20 years to know if his vote was good or not good
there are several good restaurants in vieux-québec. it'll depend of how much you're whilling to spend. i recommend the l'échaudé.
bicep bbq and kundah hotel a 2 favorite of mine. awesome food and ambiance.
madame chose at lebourgneuf is very good and the decor is unique. a little bit far from old town but it realy worth it.
guys ik this is off topic but can high-schools in quebec city make you stay till 7pm doing projects? because i heard from someone that one school does that
hi! here are my favourite: patente et machin, l’affaire est ketchup, battuto (of you can have a table, book early), sardines, cendrillon.
you should go to montreal, it's only a 2 hour drive.. totally worth it if you want to eat properly.. otherwise.. ashton? /s
we are going to montreal too!
depends if there is a freeze till then. probably so.
to answer your questions, the cable car and the panoramic staircase are always closed in winter. the bottom of the fall remains accessible from the parking lot on boulevard ste-anne.
the suspension bridge remains accessible all winter via the parking lot at manoir montmorency. i believe the mansion is closed in winter, but this information needs to be confirmed.
it is also possible to park in the neighboring streets of the manor. the parking lot on the boischatel side is closed in winter.
[
just call them at sepaq :)
merci beaucoup!  this is very helpful.  too bad about the cable car and stairs (and zipline, i'm guessing), but i think the views from the bridge and the base of the falls are worth the visit.
do you know anything about snowshoe-ing there?  i wonder how the trails would be during winter.
there is no snowshoe trail in the park itself. some trails are pretty well compacted by the visitors and local walkers, so it can be okay to walk with winter boots.
orosphere i think does botox.

>orosphere
thank you!
île-d’orléans, stoneham, lac-beauport has some nice views but charlevoix is the best. tons of trails and great hikes. have fun! bring orange vest with you since it’s hunting season. can’t never be too careful.
if you can drive to charlevoix, that's definitely the best option. the road itself should be quite pretty.
to add to what was said already: the peak of fall colors is already over in my opinion, but you will still very likely find it beautiful :)  have fun!
cap tormente.
charlevoix. jacques-cartier is awesome, but it is lacking in trees that turns red for some reason. it’s more yellowish.
hurry up! color are going quick. 
i live in stoneham and the views are great.
might be a bit late for charlevoix, i would suggest that you go to mont bélair just north of the town (after the airport). currently, the color line is pretty much on quebec city so don't go too far north.
if you're willing to drive a bit (about 1h), try massif du sud, lots of differents trails to try, hard ones & easy ones 
charlesvoix no doubt
stoneham
thank you. would you recommend skipping jean-cartier park altogether then? i am only going to have one day for those 2 places. 
also, any specific trails/hikes you would recommend at charlevoix?
thank you! i would have absolutely preponed my plans to be there at the peak if i could. but to make the best of my time there, this is what i decided to do.
thanks! would you pick that over jacques carrier or charlevoix, considering that it might be too late for charlevoix?  
getting there this weekend.
yeah, i would have absolutely loved to be there during the peak. still hoping to get some good views during my stay. so what do you think - jacques-cartier national park & stoneham or charlevoix?
i’d skip the national park but it’s a personal preference. depends if you want to climb mountains or just a casual hike. the grand-jardins national park has an exceptional site. i’d suggest you visit their [web site]( for more info. i went to hike the pioui trail a few weeks back, it was amazing.
it's closer than charlevoix and, i believe, cheaper than jacques-cartier. i'd say if charlevoix is out of the equation, both jc and ct are good picks.
jacques cartier is closer. where are you stayin?
i will be staying in quebec city but will have access to a car. from the other comments, it seems that it might be too late for charlevoix. i do get there on saturday/sunday.  
jacques-cartier national park certainly seems to be the shorter drive, but i wanted to visit the best place for experiencing the fall colors.
jacques-cartier is great buuut it's very popular, so call ahead because they limit the number of people on the trails
tewksbury is also a beautiful spot
i don’t know about the old quebec tours, but since you’ll be visiting mostly highly recommended places, it can’t go wrong. i live in beauport and i’m very familiar with the falls and île d’orléans. you won’t be disappointed. i recommend eating in different places. we have the chance to have wonderful restaurants and chefs around the city. you can zoom in with google maps while you’re in old quebec or downtown and pick using reviews depending on what you want to eat. also, i recommend ghost tours during october. i booked a visit 3 years ago with my wife. even if i live here for 20 years now, i still learned a lot of things about the city and its rich past and sometimes real spooky stories. also, musée des beaux arts and its surroundings are great to visit. 
for more activities, you can visit: 
i use it sometimes to find new activities for my family. 
have a great time in our city!
i'm not a tour bus kinda guy, i wouldnt do it... i'd go on my own if you can, check prices to rent a car..
chute montmorency and ile d'orleans are right next to each other, you can do the falls and the island in a day, or half a day depending on if thats your thing or not.
ste anne de beapre shrine is okay, and i have never heard of the gilles albert museum... but looking into the museum i will say this, the bus tour seems to give you a very good idea of quebec city and its surrounding areas so you'll get a nice complete picture of our city if you do take the bus tour :) 
hope you get good weather
i would rely on ratings from tripadvisor and or yelp to determine if this particular tour is good or not. if the ratings check out then yes. i used to live with in driving distance of quebec and would visit every summer for about 15 years. i’m way to far south to be able to drive now. anyway, about 3 years ago i took a walking tour and i learned so much. the guide was knowledgeable and had so many stories. it is a small city, but it is packed with history. sorry - can’t recall what tour i used.
thanks for the reply! we actually have already booked a ghost tour at night. we are looking forward to it!
i figured i should also ask... we are thinking about winging it while we are there to find restaurants, but i have heard they do fill up quick as well. should we be making reservations for dinner at least? or will october be less busy than the summer?
we are kind of leaning towards that idea as well. rental cars are about 45 bucks for 4 hours. we are thinking of maybe doing the route of the tour ourselves, so that we can take as long or as little as we need. 
in your opinion, if we only have 2 full days to spend sightseeing, would it be worth taking a day or half day to see the falls and some of the island?
your city looks so interesting that i'd also like to spend a day/night just wandering around old quebec, but i am worried there will be so much to see that we will have to choose one or the other.
my husband and i loved the ghost tour. we stayed at the chateau frontenac when we were there and also booked a tour of the hotel and one of the city. highly recommend a walking tour of the city of you are able to.
you definitely should! since you also need your proof of vaccination; it simplifies the process while you’re here imo.
you can do the falls and the island in half a day, im not much of an outdoors person but i am a big history nerd so for me the old quebec is where its at
i think you can fit all of your activites in the 2 days that you’ll have, but i know im a bit of a rusher.. but 1/2 day at falls and island and 1+1/2 day in old town is good !
ok thanks! do you have any recommendations of must visit restaurants?
i agree. thanks for the tip!
would you recommend just taking a drive through the island or is there any specific stops you'd recommend?
great! thanks!
it’s all about your tastebuds! i enjoy eating meat so beware if you’re more into veggies or pasta. some of the restaurants i like: côte à côte, mato, lapin sauté, cochon dingue, entrecôte st-jean, faites à l’os. there’s so many i can’t count. i suggest you take the time to look at their menu before booking.
i dint really visit the island, someone else might be of better help
the best lunch i had in quebec was at chez carlos café...it's a little hole-in-the-ground place but trust me on this one...it is amazing.
update: ooops just read again and you wrote english. was too lazy so i edited a g translate. sorry.
musée de civilization was super good, had to prebook online, canyon saint anne also great. park at the jaques cartier beach for a picnic and walk wow what a view (if you park at the top, don't take anything heavy with you the walk is difficult) if you like history at the chateau frontenac on dufferin terrace you can go to the excavations in sub for like $ 3 / adult. it lasts 30.45mins but pretty cool and you are not in the sun. must absolutely visit and stroll in old quebec. we parked in esplanade parc (just entering the walls of the old qc) so that you do not walk 2 hours to find a parking lot at the old qc. in addition not expensive. hmmm, thats all that comes to me. ah yes, aquarium if you have never done it its cool, but we have already gone and it is not long enough for the price in my opinion. finally, online you can buy 4.5 attractions packages but for me there was none for the things i all wanted so i bought separately and caa members have discounts at several attractions (10-20%). write me if you have any qs.
here is a copy of a comment i made on another thread, as you know most everything is re-opening right now so double-check beforehand! it's the general tourist version of a city guide, if i knew more about you i could be more precise, for example there are many micro-breweries that are worth a visit, or stuff for kids, or hiking spots, etc.
so for a start, the chateau frontenac on terasse dufferin is the most photographed hotel in the world its quite impressive to see, from there go down to quartier petit champlain, its an absolute must see even tough there are a lot of tourists. if you are into spooky stuff, there are ghost tours of the area as well. from down there you can take the ferry to lévis, where you will have the best view of québec city, they also have a nice old town and a history of their own. back in québec, the citadelle is a multiple century old military fort, there is a museum in there you can visit. the plains of abraham is a important site in the history of canada, where a big (but quick) battle was fought between the english and the french. the parliament is near that, you can also visit it, the architecture is beautiful. grande-allée, is a nice busy street to walk on, there is a rotating restaurant on top of the concorde hotel. for another good view, look for the city's observatory, its on top of the tallest building. not too far is the modern art museum witch is built into an old prison its quite interesting. the rue st-jean is one of the most popular street, its a quaint shopping district. when you see the hotel-dieu, the oldest hospital in north america (there's a museum) you can go down to the lower city where you will find rue st-joseph. the lower city is way less tourist-y, there's a good selection of boutiques and not too pricey restaurants. to the west of the core city area, the aquarium is pretty cool, there is a very nice park outside with a beautiful view of the bridges and the river. to the east is the ile d'orléans, take the ring road, its a country experience right next to the city there is a buch of farms you can visit. it's also right by the montmorency falls which are also quite impressive, there is a park there and a kind of ski lift with an amazing view. if the remparts (the city's junior hockey team) are playing at the videotron center, take a look! the arena is still brand new and nhl ready, the ambiance is always electrifying. there is a shoping center called les galleries de la capitale a little outside the city, with an indoor amusement park, ice skating area and fancy food market, its quite impressive. if you're willing to go a bit out of the city (20min by car), check out the village vacance valcartier, its a huge winter amusement park with massive slides and indoor water-park, tons of fun! oh! n'oubliez pas d'essayer la poutine! chez gaston on rue dorchester will give you the best potato shack poutine experience and its open very late, poutineville on rue saint-joseph is fancyer and more of a restaurant experience, they have more variety (but pretty much anywhere you go you will find poutine!)
i would say avoid eating and shopping in the old city, it's very good, but also super touristy and you will pay the price. other than that anything in the tourism guide (www.quebec-cite.com/en/) is worthwhile i would say, it depends on what you enjoy personally. one last thing, people here can easily switch to english, especially in the old quebec and other tourist spots, but we all appreciate someone making the effort, as you did in your post, to start with what little french they know, even if its only "bonjour!" and "merci!". as an isolated island of french culture in north america, we are quite proud of our roots!
i hope you have a wonderful time in our beautiful city!
if you don't want anything overpriced, don't eat within the walls of the old town. walk down to st-roch.
first, you should really try the cour arrière du festibière (this one has been a hit with everyone i showed it to) and the 737, both exterior bar. on day time, when it's sunny and hot.
if you are into beaches, you can go to la baie de beauport. it's not so great for swimming, though.
and, for nightlife, you should go in st-roch area, more precisely st-joseph street and parvis street, this is where the fun is. grande allée street used to be the place to go (you can still go) but it's not so cool anymore. the only places worth going on the grande allée are the ciel (in the concorde hotel, it's a revolving restaurant) for the view, and the oldest microbrewery in quebec city the inox. l'atelier is pretty nice too, but the grande allée is mostly expensive for what it is.
for sightseeing, you should go to la promenade des gouverneurs/governor's promenade and maybe if you like hiking you could go to the mont wright (about 40 minutes in car from downtown).
i also recommend the museum under the dufferin terrace, as someone said before me, and if you are into museum, there is the musée de la civilisation that is great, the musée national des beaux arts du québec (that is hosting a picasso exposition at the moment) and finally, the imagine picasso at the centre des congrès du québec.
of course, walking and exploring old quebec is in itself a great activity to do, you should do it too!
you can find all theses places on google maps for directions. :)
i could go on like that... quebec is an amazing city. it really depends on what kind of activities you wish to do!
this place is so good!!! really not well known and it looks like nothing but the food is so good
sorry couldn't find the english version of this one.
corridor des chemineaux, corridor du littoral and corridor de beauport are paved and in good conditions. you also have a nice track on the abraham’s plains
promenade samuel de champlain is 4.3 km long
search for a list of cycle paths. a good 80% of them will be paved and well maintained so you can rollerblade on them. i know there's a map of them somewhere.
if you're looking for rail trails, i think the [corridor des cheminots]( could be interesting. make sure you bring extra water, though, last time i biked along it, i had a real hard time finding a water fountain.
there's a nice paved path that runs along the st. charles river on both sides running between ave du pont scott and the last bridge before the river opens up into the st-lawrence, by the palais de justice. it's almost 10km round trip.
thank you i didn't know that was available. where i'm from there's many rail trails that are miles long. i'm not seeing any around that are longer length.
it is a beautiful place for roller blading but half of it is being rebuilt so it is  a dirt trail at the moment. i guess it will be finished for next year.
thank you for the info
this
build on the path of an old railway.  very gentle slope.  on you way back to downtown, you just roll down the slope for kilometers.
thank you 😊
thanks. gosh i just wanna live there with my cat 🐈
sorry i didn't know that.
la tyrolienne in ste-foy i think!
i'd be very surprised if there were only one that served fondues outdoors considering the number of restaurants here, a fair proportion with a terrasse. a little warning though, it will be extremely hot and muggy out there far as far as the weather people can tell, up to 105f with humidex. so it could be a little inconvenient to eat outdoors.
not really. maybe shops and restaurants here and there. nothing like st-léonard or petite-italie in québec.
the owner of pizzeria cappricio in limoilou is italian. he might know!
there are not that many italians in quebec city, a few tens at most. hardly a community. but there are some you could meet through the [*italiani nella città di quebec*]( facebook group.
there’s no whale close to québec city. closest is tadoussac.
i had a look before i came, it seems there used to be a tour that went from quebec city but it’s  not running this summer. the only way is renting a car and driving to tadoussac
i was sure that aml had such a cruise, but cannot find it on their website. baie ste catherine is the closest from quebec city. the (3-hour?) drive is beautiful if you change your mind.
there is no whale in quebec city...
as somebody who was born in the charlevoix region but has been living in quebec city for 20 years, there are no whales near quebec city.  you have to go to tadoussac.
yeah its pretty standard practice. if you bought it from a non-commercial party and the car is over 10 yrs old you can arrange paperwork to "buy it for a dollar". otherwise you should bring some form of buyers' contract to prove that both parties agreed on a price. if you bring your vehicle that you already had from ont. i dont believe it applies. you should either call or walk-in one of their location to get more details on your specific needs.
specifically filipino, i don't know. but maybe you would find filipino products at the international grocery store or at ja moisan on saint-jean.
oh excellent !   
strongly that it reaches the suburbs :)
no. besides, i have my appointment next week
wait until next week or june if you go out as much as i do during the pandemic.
i don't know goodyear ...
facebook link no thanks
i didn't even know that we were swearing the balm outside this year already. good. outside lallier2.0
pro tramway, nextttttt.
no matter how hard i searched, i couldn't find it anywhere on the tva site. me too it pisses me off facebook links. if you or anyone else finds it elsewhere, i will be happy to remove this post!
it goes quickly 4 years!
the regressive already have their party: quotient 21.
yes, i also looked, on the site transitonqc.org either :(
quotient 21 hahah that's too good thank you!
as much as i do, the self-righteous in the current echo chamber who like to spend other people's money are over-represented.
we will be talking about it again in the next election.
i looked there too!
you're talking about those who want to spend 10
billion for a useless tunnel? i completely agree with you!
the money will be spent elsewhere if we do not take advantage of it here. it would be completely stupid to miss 3.3 billion of investment for our city ...
oh no, thank you, it's ok, i haven't finished using the videotron center yet. / s
it is disgusting to build and waste only to take advantage of the available budgets.
mec is a good place for that. but you should know that travel is not allowed in the city due to covid.
thanks for the info!!
in montreal, people will reflexively switch to english if they think you're an english speaker. other cities may not have the amenities you might wish. quebec city is an excellent city for french immersion. 
i'm a native speaker, if you want a tutor, we can set that up.
i would definitely recommend coming to quebec city, there will be plenty of outdoor activities (like carnival), but apart from that expect to be in your airbnb or hôtel a lot. restaurants and cafes may still be take out only in jan/fev. 
if you're under the age of 30, you can apply for the explore or odyssey program! or you can look for private lessons, i'm sure there's plenty
come to québec city! you'll be fine, able to learn french more in my opinion, cause montreal is in fact quite bilingual! 
and québec is a beautifull city to visit, and have a lot of outdoor activity to offer! :p
insist on practising your french, most people will switch to english if they detect that you might not be a native speaker especially in the most tourist-y part of town around the chateau frontenac. yes i believe most activities will be shut down, they just recommended we do not see anyone during the christmass brake, not even our families. for now the winter carnival in febuary is still supposed to happen tough. as for alternative places to visit, i suggest you go north from québec city and take the road to saguenay lac-saint-jean. the road is really really nice and people up there are even more likely to not even speak english. oh and here is a good resouse for activities in french:
good luck with your exam and have a good time for the holidays!
well don't know where you coming from (might have missed it?) but right now our borders are closed until january 21st.
and no indoor dining, in red zones (québec and montréal), take out only every where right now, as well as really limited indoor activities. 
i doubt it's the best time to visit ;)
if you want to immerse yourself, quebec city is a better option than montreal. in fact, any of the smaller cities might even be better. if you wanna have fun, montreal is a better option. 
but don’t do it now. quebec is in full lockdown mode. today, they even took away the two days of christmas visits they had proposed. plus, you will have to quarantine for 14 days when you arrive. there goes your two weeks. 
jan-feb won’t be any better. frankly, i kind of envy you down in mexico, but that’s besides the point. 
there are other options in the meantime. you can find group chats (video chats), but those are mostly packed with other students. they’re good for practice, but not to improve or correct your language skills. your best bet is to work with a tutor. if you want someone in quebec city, pm me and i’ll put you in touch with someone. but since it’s remote, you can really choose anyone, from anywhere. 
good luck.
hello, im an anglophone who took the delf b2 exam (took me a year to get up to b2 t\_t)  and moved to quebec city! we are currently in the red zone so im not sure if any travel is even allowed. when i was in montreal, anytime they detected my french prononciation was abit off they switched to english but here in quebec city i think its fine.
i did a week of immersion with [ bli school it was expensive but they have activities everyday after school to show you around quebec city during your immersion.  some are free, some are extra paid. this was one of the school in quebec city i searched for that has a younger age group (18 to early 20s folks). theres others as well if u google 'immersion quebec city'. 
i believe ulaval also offer intensive french classes (albeit they are all online now)
italki is also a great place for skype lessons too. 
i dont seem to think the borders will open anytime soon, not with the level of measures we have in place for celebrating christmas....
but in anycase, i wish you good luck with your exam! you will succeed!
i saw that you are from mx. i lived in quebec in january and if you are looking for mainstream things to do there is nothing more than the museums and the hotel de glâce, even in non-covid season. besides that i do not recommend coming, the border is closed and some immigration contacts with ulaval hope that until march it will be lifted. but i hope you come another time, it is my favorite city of life. in montréal they will actually speak to you in english, if you have anything below c1 they will instantly detect your accent. trois rivières is very nice and they still speak to you in french, but if you enjoy mainstream tourism there is nothing to do. i like the malbaie and saguenay better to practice french and see nature
i introduced the delf b2 a couple of years ago. if you want tips send inbox hehe
watch out for quebec city, they can be super mean to anglos
lol there is absolutely nothing to do in quebec right now.  no restaurant no bars nothing opened only some stores.  you won’t even be able to practice your french beside when you shop.  plus, it’s going to be freezing at -10 to -20 for most of january/february.  i guarantee you will regret coming because you’ll be waisting your time.
wait at least until the summer.  trust me.
exactly next year on st roch:
[arkhamcafé] (
watch out, the chinese flu is everywhere, even here.
id definitely be interested, i’ll shoot you a message later!
right, yeah i’m interested in private lessons, i’ve searched online an due to covid almost all options are remote right now, which is of course to be expected, do you happen to have the contact of a tutor?
merci! sounds good, thanks for your response, let’s hope travel is permitted next year, i’d love to visit your country!
right, it makes sense, kinda hoping for the best regarding this lockdown situation haha, i’m from mexico, so i thought travel was permitted a few months back but i think everything is closed again.
see i've heard that, but yet to experience it. i don't doubt it but people hear my accent and they're not mean or anything
this wasn't my experience, living there for four years.
alright, hope to hear from you!
sadly it didn't reopen since march. :/
costco i think? problem is, most people are still changing their tires. it may be hard to find a place not busy willing to change your oil the same day.
there is mostly no necessity to have one since we're mostly changing our oil at the same time that we're change our tire.
pneu et mécanique d'estimauville doesn't need any appointment though, you will just have to wait maybe an hour.
you could try st-foy toyota, it's been a while but they at least use to do drive-in oil change.
unless your body is adapted to cold and humid weather, i recommend a winter coat, gloves and boots. if you plan to walk around for several hours, a scarf would be a good thing to bring.
i have approximatly half a feet on snow on my car. so yeah, winter coat, boot, mitains, hat are a must.
it’s been hovering around 0, but it looks like the snow is here to stay. 
as for wind, if you’re planning to spend much time in vieux québec/st-jean, you’ll definitely want to bring hats and scarves/something with a hood. it’s typically a lot windier on top of the hill.
don’t forget to put something on your head and cover your ears :-p
waterproof boots, unless you want to be miserable is very important.
merino wool base layer, mid layer fleece and puffy jacket if you're walking around. mittens are recommended but if you want some dexterity glove liners and gloves (i run cold). merino wool socks (pack an extra pair in your day bag) and waterproof snow shoes. 
beanie and neck warmer/scarf. 
it may seem like overkill reading this but it's better to be able to remove a layer than wish you had one when you're up the hill. 
it's not the temperature but the wind chill is the killer.
socks and flip flop will do semi
as of 7am
or plastic bag in your shoes if you don't have waterproof one
lmao man got me cracking up
it saved me on vacation a lot of times. must be mix with newpaper in the shoes overnight too
some people do that commute daily to go to work in québec. definitely doable with winter tires on your rental. route 138 is a major road in the region and is well maintained. 
if you have the budget, check out the scenic train that does quebec–le massif!
awesome, thanks for the reply.
and winter tires are mandatory in quebec so your rental car will have them. i agree with my fellow redditor, the place is amazing, but i tend to avoid the road to baie-saint-paul with heavy snow.
*sigh*
ah that's not cool.
> mayor lehouillier will be back in force at city hall. his team won 15 of the 16 available seats in this election, most by a strong majority.
the right reaction.
i am new to levis. a reason why for this reaction?
new in lévis too, but i come from quebec. his ego annoys me a bit and i find that he doesn't invest much in certain districts. i really liked the candidate who ran for rl in my sector
i find that public transport is terribly deficient in lévis. he doesn't like it - he notably refused to embark on the srb project with quebec which could have given him a chance. as he is re-elected with such a large majority, it will take a nasty stretch before the situation improves.
ok, yeah.
i'm teleworking at the moment, but then it's the bus.
i presume moments of misery then! haha thanks
it's been 7 years since i postpone my driving license and i took my apprentice after 2 months in lévis .... that says it all
just finished quebec highschool, never had to stay passed 4h, student can choose complementary activity, never heard of people beeing force to stay until 7pm except people with these activity or some school's detention
my son just finished high-school, he was never focerd to stay at school after 4pm.
forced, no. just before the pandemic, the provincial government invested heavily in extracurricular activities (sport, cultural, hobbies), but those activities are not mandatory.
i have two daughters. one finished high school and one  is going to finish next year. they've never had to do that.
also finished qhs, teachers would find it weird that we were still there around 3:45pm because my earliest city bus to go home was at 4pm.
hmmm i don’t think you are aware to which extent quebec city is french. it is like asking on r/boston where to find live music/comedy club in french, which does not require speaking english whatsoever. that would come across as obnoxious. 
you can surely have a conversation with locals or ask direction in english, but be aware english is most’s second language and local art scene/entertainment offer will vastly be in french 
why not just go and watch whatever seems interesting to you, be it in french or english ? i understand for comedy club, but i’m sure you can enjoy a local french band without understanding the lyrics !
tonight, there is a live music event called limq wich is basicly music improv. absolutly amazing event. it start at 7:30 pm. have a look at their facebook event ans buy ticket. trust me, you won't regret it!
go to mcfly to havé some arcade
you could go to la revanche for board games
thank you for taking time to respond! i suspected that most entertainment options would be in french. some cities i've visited in other countries sometimes still have some events in english (often for an expat community). personally i would prefer to attend an event in french to have a stronger sense of place while we are here.  
do you have any recommendations for places to go to enjoy live music?
thank you for the recommendation. we went to this and it was fantastic!!
you’re welcome ! there might be some from time to time indeed, but those would be rather hard to find and probably mainly promoted within those expat groups. 
anyways, here are the usual references for live music. only le fou bar hosts a jazz band tomorrow but maybe you could get to le scanner or l’anti, have a drink and ask bartenders if they are aware of anything. they might be more knowledgable that i am !
- [le scanner bistro] (
-[le pantoum](
- [le fou bar] (
- [l'anti] (
there is also this one i just found, which seems to have live bands every night, but i don’t know if that’s what you’re looking for : [le phoenix du parvis](
if you want to see something very typical of quebec, there is an improv match tuesday at [palais montcalm]( this will require some french skills but it may be fun nevertheless.
of course, if you’d had been here for the weekend, or during summer, it would have been easier to find something interesting. also, covid shut down caused a lot of bands to split and live venues to close.
you are very welcome! really glad you liked it! it is an odd concept but a really fun and sometime magical moment that we can share with some astonishing musician!
thank you so much for the recommendations! these sound like some good options.
hihihi
* “le don” vegetarian place is pretty good ($$). 
* hit up one of “le subtil” locations for a healthy sub/wrap with a nice soup (not too salty) ($). 
* freshii is always a good option for a bowl, salad, or healthy burritos. ($). 
* “la galette libanaise” is not too bad if you make a judicious choice from their lebanese sandwiches ($).
* “bols et poké st-jean” is awesome, if a little more expensive ($$) for some fish options.
many cafes will have soup/salad/sandwich type lunches. if you like cats, you might enjoy cafe felin chats-nous, which is close to the old town. the owners are lovely people! i will add the caveat that i've never been there for lunch, only coffee/pastries.
try le cochon dingue. they have several restaurants in quebec city.
try the restaurant section and "mets préparés" of la carotte joyeuse, a small grocery store on rue st-jean. pre-covid, they used to have a section with chairs and tables: 
there is also paillard, they have plenty of options for salads and sandwiches: 
au petit coin breton is also a very good option on rue saint-jean for a nice lunch, they have soups, salads, savoury crêpes and sandwiches. their decor is also very cozy: 
i also recommend le subtil, it is yummy! it is located underground, near palais des congrès. this location seems to be temporarily closed though.
these are all the places i go for lunch when i am on a week-long business trip in vieux-québec. enjoy!
ogari san on saint-joseph makes nice poke-type bowls too, in a “you pick what you want to put in it“ way! there a fish options but meat and vegetarian too. and the portion sizes are good (the small one is perfect for a light lunch, still pretty filling). i use to grab those quite often when i worked in that area. there are yuzu sushi locations pretty much everywhere too if you like that, you can grab a premade box and they’re not bad!
hi there!
i lived in that building for 7 years, between 2010 and 2017. i was in a "2½" or as they call it in english, a "junior 1 bedroom". i was a student at laval university and i think it was a great deal for the price paid (great location, great setting, close to services). i never had any problems and it was generally very quiet as older people lived in the building at the time.
the old quebec area proper (inside the walls) is not very large and can be walked end to end in about 20-25 min. that said, that apartment building is closer to the walls and the saint-jean-baptiste neighborhood, so you would be close (5 min walk) to services (grocery stores, drug stores, major bus lines). people living closer to the petit champlain area or the château frontenac on the other hand have to walk about 15 min to reach the closest grocery store by foot. i would always recommend living closer to the walls and gates (especially the saint-jean and kent gates).
i really loved living in the old quebec area and i would recommend it for people staying for a short period of time. the only thing that bothered me in the end, after 7 years, was that the streets were always busy with people sightseeing and they would be "in the way" sometimes.
yeah, quebec city, rental market in general is really cheaper compare to other cities in english canada. you can always find affordable rents in the old town as those apartments are smaller with less parking and far from supermarkets and cegep or the main campus of the university. 
quebec city is really sprawl and during a long time the old town used to be more poor, kind of shady, and at light years to what it is today with all the government funding that went into renovating the historic buildings. that explains the lower rents.
you can smoke anywhere it's not bad like in mtl.
you'll be fine smoking outside in most areas.
you could smoke almost anywhere before legalization.  just light up wherever you are standing
since legalization, the rules for marijuana are the same as cigarettes. smoking anywhere is allowed except for enclosed spaces (inside restoration and public transport) and terraces.
if i'm not mistaken, it's illegal in quebec (civil code) or in canada (criminal code), i don't remember which one, not to be privately insured.
that is to say, the police who stop you and realize that you don't have insurance are going to give you a ticket + i think can have your tank towed as it is not insured.
your private insurance comes to pay the damage to the other car if you are responsible; and as there is the law of "no fault" in quebec, the other driver cannot sue you even if you are responsible. hence also why we have the saaq which is a bodily injury insurance (disability, death, etc.), because once again we cannot sue the person responsible for our disability. (if you get beaten up in the street, you can sue for damages and problems incurred, but not if a tank / truck / motorcycle is involved!)
saaq insurance only covers bodily injury. you need private insurance for civil liability.
you must have private insurance in case you fit in a $ 600,000 lambo. the saaq is not going to pay for the damage to the car that you just petered out. we call that to ensure an edge!
i just renewed mine. contact the big names, it's worth shopping around. desjardins offered me $ 1,700 and ssq offered me $ 750 for the same protections. guess who i decided to take out insurance with.
in fact, chapter a of automobile insurance (fpq1) is compulsory in quebec in order to drive an automobile.
a damage insurance broker could sell this product to you or you could contact the insurers yourself.
you have the right not to insure your car for yourself, but you must insure your car for others. this is why we sometimes speak in popular parlance of ensuring “two edges” or just “one edge”.
fun fact. the majority of standard auto insurance in quebec will insure you for 1 or 2 million. if you crash an exotic car worth millions of dollars and your insurance doesn't cover the full value of that tank, guess who is going to pay the balance. if you see pagani, bugatti, koneigsseg and other ultra exotic tanks, stay away from them on the road, it could cost you bankruptcy.
i don't know, i pay 300 a year with desjardins.
always call at least 5. every 4-5 years, you call 10 to see if you don't have a pleasant surprise.
if you break a million car, how much more will your insurance cost you in the future?
i don’t know them but i’ve walked passed this shop many times and it has great reviews so you might want to check it out:
[cyclo services](
probably the jacques cartier river?
fair warning: wherever you choose to go, if it is a national park you must reserve online beforehand, and i would suggest doing it a few days in advance as the weather has been very warm here lately.
my nomination is jacques-cartier national park.
just know that starting september 1st, you will need the vaccine proof pretty much for every activity where you are in close contact with people in the province of quebec, including rafting (red that today and i remember that this activity requires it).

it is far from old quebec.
hotel pur, 395 de la couronne street, g1k 7x4.
≈ $275 per night (1 room for 2 adults)
it’s located in the lower part of quebec city. from there, you can walk to old quebec (tourist area) and drive almost everywhere else easily. 
les lofts have a few great locations. i highly recommend les loft dorchester, charest, st-joseph, st-vallier : 
quebec city is pretty small and as soon as you are outside the walls of old quebec (the tourist area), everything is affordable, you may want to stay close enough to take public transit. look around 'place laurier' which is one of our big shopping malls or maybe at the edges of 'beauport' a suburb just north of old quebec
thank you!!

you may want to specify it's a survey directed at women (or at least, people who wear bras)...
you noticed? good :)
yes
depends on where in the province. in montreal, it's a lot more feasible to live without french. elsewhere it would be really hard to enjoy life without french.
this subreddit if about quebec city (and metro area) which is where i live. you can get by with english in tourist-y areas, for sure, and you'll often find someone who speaks english in most businesses, but it's not a norm and it can quickly get awkward.  finding a job with no french would be *very* hard. and again, it's the local language, you'll have a hard time fitting in if you can't talk to most people.
montreal is different but it can also be a problem even there sometimes. i know people who lived there for a long time and never cared to learn french and were fine until the day they suddenly lost a job and had a hard time finding another without french. still, it is possible.
i've been living here for a while now and i've learned french. makes it a lot easier, trust me. if you force yourself a little at first, it becomes second nature.
strictly speaking, no. but is it a good idea? not at all.
if your plan is to move here, but you don't feel comfortable with your french skills, you do plan to learn it and you've got a job offer that'd allow you to work while you learn, then by all means come along. just don't expect it to be easy to find a job or interact with government services without a lick of french. be grateful if it works, but don't expect it if you don't want to be disappointed.
you can currently get by without french, although it's extremely helpful. you will occasionally encounter a place without english speakers and you will at times be talked down to for not understanding in french. 
you'll get the occasional "in quebec we speak french".
but you'll miss so much if you remain ignorant. for starters, québec has amazing music, literary and television shows that are produced in french. in the more mundane, the information given by the news and particularly politicians can be different between the languages. contracts are signed in french. if you lease and apartment or buy a house, you are in the precarious position of trusting someone else to translate for you.
it’s possible to manage in quebec city without any french, but your life will be a lot harder. from your profile, it looks like you’re hoping to become a paramedic, so finding a job without any french will be impossible. there are anglo communities online that can recommend bilingual service providers, but chances are you’ll be limited to one or two choices and they may be across the city from you. and as someone else mentioned, interacting with government services (especially at the municipal level) will be hit or miss; many agencies’ websites are only partially translated at best. 
if you’re wondering about the province as a whole, montreal is more anglo-friendly but outside of that french is essentially mandatory. so your options will be fairly limited. 
tl;dr: technically no, but it’s a huge pita if you don’t at least have some french.
they are free french class for immigrants if you are interested. and as other already told you, it may not be impossible because people will accommodate you with english. but it will be boring for you not to be able to make friends, understand local news, attend local events, etc..
no, but yes.
like can you buy groceries and find the odd bilingual officer at the saaq? yes. but will you have a shitty social life? yes.
i would like to add that if you do, you should try to live in the more old quebec area, because of the tourists, people there are used to speak english.
i have several friends who work in the videogame industry here in quebec city and they don’t speak french at all! they are doing fine. it’s hard for some being far from their families but other than that. it’s a touristic city. plenty of young people in the service industry too. they all speak english very well.
as a tourist, i’ve never had a language barrier, my intermediate french was more than enough. i wonder if it would be enough when i relocate to québec.
it would be like moving to italy and going only to mcdonald. you might be more confortable with the menu, but you will miss all the good stuff.
there are also pockets of english-speaking folk in the suburban areas of shannon and valcartier, north of the city. locals are mostly of irish and english descent and they are almost all perfectly bilingual. 
they are supplemented by military families who serve at valcartier cfb, one of the largest if not the largest military base in canada. english-speaking members of the armed forces are a dime a dozen up there but that being said, the base perimeter is the only area you could spend your entire life not speaking french but you wouldn't be really living in the city proper  then.
i was 21 when i moved here from maine (usa) in 1984 and did not speak french at all but managed to learn it over the years because i was in love with this splendid city (and with a local girl lol). i speak french with an english accent but that seems to please locals because they see me as an anglo who bothered to make the effort of learning their language, which is socially very rewarding.
you are right, i forgot about that part of the city!
i love your story!
thanks math!
it's easy to forget shannon... because people there enjoy being ignored by developers. my ex, whose last name is the very irish mccarthy, grew up there and while her family speaks mostly english at home, they are all perfectly bilingual and by that i mean they speak both languages with no accent in either. well, no accent other than standard north american english like in many parts of the us and most of canada. i speak with a new england yankee twang that i could never get rid of. they say i sound kinda like jfk lol. i find it odd that foreigners including canadians associate the word yankee with anyone from the us when in reality it only applies to people from new england and ny state. but i digress.
the little town of shannon is quite enchanting nestled in the mountains that shield it from the city's light pollution so they get to see the stars at night, milky way and all. for my part i live in the charlesbourg urban district and i can see about 4 or 5 stars when i look up at night. pity, really. :(
the du verdier apartments have certain blocks that accept dogs,
the new block behind rue myrand (le liénard i believe) accepts dogs if you have a budget.
i found a nice card for those interested: 
i think we can do it on the plains of abraham (for free?). otherwise, the villeneuve campsite in beauport has good trails and is not too expensive. finally, camp mercier, between stoneham and laurentides park (via the 175 north) is the best place near quebec in my opinion.
the ste-foy outdoor center.
mont belair outdoor base.
duchesnay tourist station.
portneuf wildlife reserve.
otherwise the ski-neuf center in portneuf has a network of 20km. or st-leonard de portneuf also have a similar network in the mountains.
or the regional natural park of portneuf - les portes de l'enfer sector.
windmill trails!
> i think we can do it on the plains of abraham (for free?).
all cross-country ski fields in quebec city are free this year because of the covid. now i'm looking for boots, it's pretty hard to find these days, sports stores had more before christmas and it's all closed.
individual winter sports equipment should have counted as essential.
thank you. i hear a lot about camp mercier. it must be good. the villeneuve campsite is very close. i can't wait to try.
well, i went to camp mercier, and i have to say i agree with its excellence. well laid out and a superb part of the country.
it would have been necessary to see in the user, but with all the stores closed, there are only individuals left and to try without contacts it starts to be quite complicated ...
for boots i prefer new, i always have to try several pairs before i find something that looks good.
for the skis i can go in the used one. i already have them but they are old and not compatible with modern boot ties.
i made 8 places before finding a pair that suited me. i sympathize.
at jacques
la chope gobeline on rené-lévesque
le salon d'edgar, le projet, le st-angèle, ninkasi... those are all nice bars from what i've experienced/heard! as for restaurants, if you're looking for something cozy and budget friendly, la cuisine and chez temporel are two of my personal favorites, they're really unusual and mostly unknown by tourists. if you're looking for something fancier though, bati bassac and le clocher penché are really good.
there's going to be a christmas market in old quebec. usually, they put an outside german bar. could be an option!
le st-angèle is awesome for a good evening out. as for restaurant, depending on what kind of food you like , bicep bbq and kundah hotel are two of my favorite restaurant in town. really nice ambiance and food is always amazing. boith of them are really small but both of them are run by amazing chef!
uncle antoine 🍻
do you know when the dates of the christmas market?
+1 for biceps bbq!

fizz ftw
in beauport 2 years ago i tried it and i had nothing that worked, no stability.
no, but they will if you break the 8pm-5am curfew just like everybody else. also, not sure why you’d come since there’s pretty much nothing to do right now.
why would you think that?
rentals often have plates from other provinces. i was worried i’d get in trouble with people (more than police) riding my rental car with an ontario plate during the holidays and last summer’s rental. went fine.
nope
no they wont.
i moved here this summer from ontario.  went about 2 months with ontario plates and had no issues.
if you’re just concerned about being pulled over for just plates, no you will be fine you have 6 months when you enter quebec to keep your plates and license after that you will need to swap them is what i have been told.
1-not really but iirc the olf as they call it here is not so much about teaching french to newcomers. it's a government agency whose main purpose is to ensure of the quality of the french language used in the public sphere such as in government publcations, school manuals and such, and verbal communication with residents of the province.
2- personally i haven't been in contact with that agency much. when i arrived here 40 years ago i spoke only english and the then strong nationalistic spirit that permeated hiring policies for public service jobs made it such that many government agencies employees either did not speak any english or were unwilling to. english speakers who were canadian citizens had access to federal programs to assist them in learning french but as a us citizen i was pretty much left to rely on my own in learning the language. things have changed a lot since, all for the better.
3- m0ral and ethical not so much but the olf has an immense influence on the traditional written media. as for the online social media it is powerless and it shows. the rare occasions i surf on the local pages of facebook/instagram and private forums i am appalled at the horrible quality of the language many users resort to but who can blame them when there are university professors who can't write a paragraph without throwing several misspellings in the mix and use high-school level grammar? i have seen this countless times. the olf is doing its dammit best to improve things but like all bureaucratic entities it is painfully slow.
6- no. i knew when i decided to live here that interaction with local businesses would be conducted almost exclusively in french and i'm perfectly at ease with this. people don't seem to mind my english accent either which is cool.
4- negative. but i know people who have.
5- no
7- no but before my retirement my job involved sitting alone in the cab of huge tvm tractors listening to hard rock day and night pushing snow on industrial properties. but coms were in french... mostly. :d
good morning!
i cheat a little while answering (i have a master's degree in linguistics from a quebec university and i tried to apply to the oflq twice, so my opinion is positive). i am proud to speak quebec french and i seek to protect it therefore… my general opinion is in this direction. i only did the first six questions because i laid a block for you
1. the initial work of the oflq (among others by hélène cajolet-laganiere - i think i massacred her last name) played in my eyes as essential a role in the conservation of french in quebec as bill 101 guides like “le français au bureau” made it possible for people whose mother tongue is french to work in french, something significant because my grandparents did not have this luxury without giving up climbing the social ladder. . these days, their terminology office offers terms that eventually come into use. as a linguist, i do not consider that it is a little too normative (it pushes rules) but its impacts are mostly positive.
2. i would like to work there so i would be a very poorly shod shoemaker if i said that their services were not beneficial. they will serve me even more after my second master's degree in translation.
3. it is not the oflq which imposes the french language, but a decision of the government of quebec (by the means of a series of legislations in the years 1960 to 2021). the best known of these laws is bill 101, which stems from several factors including the laurendeau-dunton commission. this law is the last which lays down several essential elements for the preservation of french (posting in french, government services in french, schooling of newcomers in french). it stems from a real problem of preserving a language in a minority context. the english-speaking (pan-canadian) media have spit on quebec to protect the french fact in america (without promoting the necessary indigenous languages). francophones are a minority surrounded by millions of anglophones who speak what is called lingua franca (common language used when two speakers do not speak the same language). in my view, it is a moral obligation to protect the language and oflq plays an essential role
4. i do not always agree with the decisions of the oflq. they took several that i find more than questionable but i understand that they have an essential role.
5. the oflq, like language regulators, does not have a coercive role. i (quite openly) declined some of their suggestions. they suggest but cannot impose a use. it is the speakers who ultimately decide.
this is long enough but if you feel like having any other informations, feel free to dm me.
>there are university professors who can't write a paragraph without throwing several misspellings in the mix and use high-school level grammar? i have seen this countless times. 
i literally make a living helping them ... revision at university level is both stimulating because you learn a lot and sometimes you are invited to participate in the content, and very discouraging. i feel like subspecialization doesn't help much.
i believe saveurs du monde on st-jean is halal! some of the tastiest shish taouk in town, in my opinion :)
so i’m actually in a similar position to you rn! except i’m on vacation in quebec city rn! i can tell you that the forestry here is gorgeous! i went to the montmorency falls yesterday and it’s gorgeous! old quebec is for sure a gorgeous place to go! if you’ve ever been to paris it’ll remind you of it! dt quebec is nice as well. but i highly recommend visiting as many of their parks as possible, it’s gorgeous!
thanks! what're some generally (not halal) quebec city specific foods? i'll try to find halal alternatives
there aren't really dishes specific to québec city, they are québécois dishes in general
check out the menu at la buche for ideas. it's a quebecois restaurant :)
mmmm, shepherd's pie.
hello op!
   you are posting to the quebec city reddit which is actually a few hours out of chambly. best you be to post jn r/montreal or something similar.
kijiji is for local purchases that you do in person. if you wanted something shipped to you, try ebay
to bawl with your mouth full, that's quebec!
not having the best social safety net in north america?
comparing yourself to the united states and the rest of canada is not setting the bar very high.
certainly the roc must be solidly less worse than the us in this department?
indeed, but it remains a very modest objective.
drill, lmao
the person who surely hasn't lived in limoilou has a very strong opinion, i see.
expanding the suburbs is wrong.
building big buildings is bad.
what do you mean a million for a slum? that no crackle of common sense!
quebec is commonly among the safest city in north america.
are these beautiful parts of the city in the suburbs? quite a few yuppie dinks probably prefer to live near as many things as possible.
i have lived in vieux-limoilou for almost 20 years and i have never been "drilled", stolen or vandalized. could it be that the po has big prejudices?
no prejudice lol
where are you staying op? beauport? charlesbourg? loretteville? how much does it cost you in time and money to get to town to work with your two suvs (not to mention what it costs the company to maintain your pavement to get you there)?
i like much better to pay more for a house / condo in the city, to cost less to society and to live with the motés, than to have a swimming pool, a double garage, 3 tanks, to be expensive for everyone and live with the mongols who listen to ham radio
edit: the only case that looks pierced here is your judgment, bro
i don't know if this is just a case of gentrification, i think the value of land has also skyrocketed for several years. here in saint-sauveur, when we bought our house, the value of the land was almost as much as the value of the house (tiny lot !!!!)
supply and demand. real estate is crazy. everyone wants to be in limoilou because we feel good there. (and we don't get pierced, is it safe, wtf?)
are you starting to look to buy now? la cite-limoilou was surely the borough most affected by recent price increases in the real estate market for a year and a half. i have friends who are looking for condos and still have a lot to choose from within their budget (around 250k), but overall not a lot of products available, so that doesn't help with the prices.
many professionals who work in st roch but who want to live not too far away. the gigantic hospital that is being built and the people who don't want to live in maizerets ...
compared to st sauveur or st roch a lot less chance of "getting drilled" :)
go to 
click an address and in the pop-up, click on the form (3rd icon from the left, kind of blue sheet of paper icon)
it opens the city's rating page.
we can't know which condos / townhome you're talking about, but there's a bunch of old buildings that have never been repaired worth 300k / 400k.
i moved to limoilou. it wouldn't hurt a little gentrification. there are too many ugly people
quebec in general is very safe, you're not in the us, you're not going to get drilled haha
i stayed in the “hot neighborhood” according to the jdm and there was nothing hot.
i was never afraid to stay inside with the skidded doors even on the ground floor. i have always slept with the windows open.
exactly. what is the next step ? close immigration?
not necessarily dinks, limoilou is full of children now.
as much demagoguery as the post of op.
there is a damned margin between a house at 1m in the course of a triplex (besides, we have seen it all, it's been since before the pandemic that it is for sale) and a two-storey house in beauport in 350,000. you have to do some damn 15-minute journeys in a toyota corolla for it to make a difference.
you see, i too am able to say extremes… 🙄
right on
there is also all the development on d'estimauville which increases the nearby residential.
criss, i just bought a house in st-roch, no one told me i was going to get drilled. did i get screwed ?!
at least take the time to say hi next time
it is perhaps the streets full of pedestrians that scare them. people who dare to move without their tanks, a real public danger!
same same
why are you thinking? i noticed that there are a lot of daycare centers.
yes. i'm exchanging your house for mine in boomertown beauport side where everything is painfully quiet but safe.
(lol)
haha that's true, dogs on every street corner
i think i'll take a chance and save $ 3000 worth of gas a year.
depends where.
there are some regions (green ones) where you can't enter. but moving between yellow/red should not pose problems.
theres a curfew, make sure you're inside between 20h and 5h else you risk 500$+ fine.
non-essential travel is not recommended. you won't get harassed, but if you do get stopped they'll expect a reason to be travelling  between provinces and also between regions of quebec. i live in this city and haven't left the capital region since september, so some people may be insulted to have tourists visiting at this time.
sadly with the current state of mind of our citizens, i cannot guarantee they won’t call the cops on you even if you being here would be totally legal...
there’s a terrifying tendency for denunciation right now that’s been generated by the government and the measures in place...
so if you come, just be ready for that sadly...
it would be quebec city. we booked at the chateau without a problem and they said it’s no issue but they are also a business looking to make money
you need the passport for restaurants, bars, cafes (if you want to sit down, take out doesn’t require it), indoor concerts and movie theaters. walking in normal shops or malls doesn’t require it. i think museums don’t ask for it, but i’d advise to call the places you want to visit beforehand, just in case !
what kind of businesses? anything non-essential will require the passport, i guess you could stroll around in a grocery store if you want.
mostly looking for bars or restaurants that aren't asking for it
you'll have to enjoy the rain then
don't be such a dick if you didn't have anything helpful to say then you should have kept your fuckin mouth shut
oh no, your decisions have consequences... enjoy the weather bud.
[removed]
what bar was it? 
that's totally illegal and they risk a substantial fine
probably the kirouac 2.0 haha
omg totally illegal, fines omg. fuckin narc.
they probably neven done anything illegal except goin into moms fridge after 00:00 and having the mind set of ive seen everything in life even if im 16
it's also called “being in depression”
you look boring, kevin. take your karen and move from quebec. go to esti ontario. make yourself (and us too) happy.
yes, it lacks distractions
but pulled pork is hell;)!
make mush you'll see, you'll change your mind
i have always believed that the best way to fight suicide is adrenaline. i'm not a shrink, but i have the impression that dark thoughts quickly disappear when you do something interesting.
hey, fuck you my host. quebec is really a flat city.
lmaooooooooo i just saw your profile bro tes loser en tbk a comment on porn subreddit 😂😂😂😂😂😂
but it's not because he tells you it's bad that he's on the verge of suicide ...;) don't distort his thinking
kevin says: in quebec, not in quebec. look with your eyes. you both lower the province's iq.
no, i'm just telling you f \ * \ * \ * you because giantcocktouzani probably just wanted to let off steam, then you come to squeal your ego then your quebec pride in the way.
you want to find iq points' go listen to george carlin and then realize how big you are in your white-knighter shorts for the province with the dignity of a sort of tadpole stuck in a swimming pool filter. i'm glad to be quebecer, but proud? bahahahaha, you might as well be proud of the asphalt color in your yard like a fool's host.
fac, f \ * \ * \ * you. then also, we live in a cr \ * sse of a flat city with disturbed gauls like you.
wow man, you know there are doctors out there who can probably prescribe something to calm your nerves. he has the right to let off steam on kevin. i also have the right to my opinion. as you have the right to yours. then listening to george carlin won't increase your iq points, but taking other college courses will. then i don't live in quebec city and i don't have asphalt, what you do is spray. (in psychology and psychoanalysis, projection corresponds to the mental operation by which a person attributes his own feelings to someone else, in order to get out of an emotional situation experienced as intolerable by him). who know, maybe i gave you some intelligence.
do you know that iq points don't exist? do you know that you can be a doctor, and still be a creak of a debilo-menthos pedal? you will never, ever escape from it. you are a big cellar, a big cellar crunch, thick as it can't be, but here it isn't, because there is so much space in quebec, that we have room for the most big hugs from idiots, the kind of place in north america that spots the most ufos in the sky. it's your crisse of big shaking heads. i bet yours keep an entire abitibi village in the shadows, my dirty screeching.
again, go see a doctor man. you have problems. please go to consult.
little slobber without imagination who has nothing to say ... so it's really your personality. come on, go piss off other people with your bds.
so much hate, poor you. you must be feeling so lonely. i pity you. do you want to talk about it? was your mother there for you when you were young?
lol
