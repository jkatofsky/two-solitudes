in before lockdown and curfew by october
can someone explain to me how our health care minister is somehow surprised that we are so low on nursing staff? like this has been common knowledge for years even before covid...
when are we going to start actually holding the government accountable?? when we go into lockdown again this winter, it would have been 100% preventable if our government wasn't totally useless.
my gym is not checking the vaccine passport and i low key want to file an anonymous complaint because i think this is dangerous behaviour (look at alberta they are back to restrictions)
edit: they started checking . something must have happened
this is good news for our children.
[  
we continue to move in the right direction.
anyone know how i can report establishments that let people in who are not vaccinated!?
[deleted]
i know this is long for everybody but what's the best estimate for when is the pandemic going to end? we've been 90% vaccinated for what feels like months already.
is anyone else worried about what will happen after most of the population gets vaccinated? what if its not a high enough percentage ? are we gonna become like in australia? i understand that theirs a virus but its 99,7% chance of recovery, aren’t we making a big deal? how much longer is it gonna last ? what the hell is going on
zero checking of the qr code at my gym this morning! 😂😂😂
came back from the us today, the covid test at the border got results back in less than 8 hours. pretty impressed. i'd expect that time just to transport it to whatever lab but there must be one close or onsite maybe
edit: sorry, this response is not related to montreal. mods will probably have to delete this.
does anyone know what happened to aaron derfel?
he hasn't updated his twitter since late july and i miss his daily updates.
according to dre. m. drouin at her press conference today, in quebec the data shows that:
* the unvaccinated are 4x more likely to catch covid than the vaccinated.
* the  unvaccinated with covid are 30x more likely to be hospitalized than the vaccinated.
is the "anti-measures" crowd misguided? yes.
will the government conveniently use it as a scapegoat on which to blame our failing health care system despite years of neglect, incompetence and inability to think beyond the next cycle of elections? yes too.
anyone else super worried about the impact on the healthcare system next week when 20k employees will be suspended? i understand how important it is to be vaccinated, but i feel like the government didn't bother putting a back up plan in place and our healthcare system will indeed collapse with even less staff available. what happens to all the people who have family doctors that will be suspended friday? they need to go back on the waiting list for 5 years hoping they get a new one? what about people who had surgies scheduled in the next few weeks? follow up appointments?
so i’m going to a concert soon at the mtelus venue (bought the tickets in january 2020…) and i’m wondering about what i should be expecting. will everyone be wearing a mask during the entire concert? will we have to socially distance ourselves in the crowd? anything different because of covid (outside of passport required)?
if any of you went to in-door concerts recently, i’d appreciate details from your experience!
how can we report restaurants that ignore the measures and do not request the vaccination passport? i can't find anything on quebec.ca
......
how can we report restaurants that are ignoring the vaccine passport measures? i looked on quebec.ca but couldn't find anything.
edit: oops just realized this was answered already further down. submitted a police report. sorry for double-post!
fuck. so first the passport app i couldn't download because i have usa google account.
then i get a raw apk and it says i'm not vaccinated fully. i got a second dose outside of qc and brought in proof and had them fix the record after weeks of hunting the fuckers down in a place that would do it for me despite months of backlog appointments.
now the site is crashing and the one time i got through it tried to tell me i can't use the online form to get proof anymore. but idk if that was an error or like a real issue.
i'll have to call tomorrow i guess and pray they can fix it over the phone. good stuff...
edit:
ok so, site is okay right now (3am) and i got a different message from the website. this one gave me a new qr code and it does infact validate in the app. thank goodness. 
so, tldr, if your original qr code does not validate in the app, check for an updated one through the quebec website! and if you're region blocked from downloading the app, just get the apk from a trusted mirror or downloader.
my little positive contribution.
the new cases seem to be standing low; looks like we've passed through the 4th wave.
(including schools, cegeps and universities, performance halls .., the quiet return to the office of several people ....)
oh boy i am not looking forward to tomorrow. the self service portal says it's not possible to download my proof of vaccination, and as far as i can tell without that qr code i'm fucked. i have the phsyical paper saying i got my second dose back in june, but no qr code on it :(
hi everyone, i'm curious if there is any real-world or clinical data on whether vaccine passes like what have just been implemented in quebec are actually effective at reducing spread of covid-19? in other words, in the actual types of locations in which they are being required like restaurants and cinemas (edit: and the real-world ratio of vaccinated to unvaccinated clients that could be expected in those places, and other mitigating factors like masks still being required during a film screening, etc.), is there any data on how well they limit transmission?
i've tried a few google search terms but the sources i've come across seem to just take it as a given so i'm curious what the actual rationale is. like if you have 30 people in a restaurant where 3 of them are not vaccinated, how likely is it that any of those 3 actively have covid and if they do how likely is it that any of the other 27 in the place will become infected given that they are vaccinated? compared to a restaurant where all 30 clients are vaccinated? compared to a school or factory?
(maybe this is better in askscience or something but i figured i'd post here because it's specifically relevant to montreal and i've had some good discussions on similar topics in the past! thanks)

does anyone know of a school/children's non-profit/etc. that takes electronics? i have a plug-in drawing tablet that i no longer need, it's lightly used and works like new.

(i repost here, sorry mods!)
hey so, as a christmas present, i would like to give my parents an evening at the
restaurant (after the holidays), but i'm mainly looking for a place
little out of the ordinary, either with a theme, or a show or a
simply original atmosphere.
i took my dad to o'noir a few years ago, and he liked it
experience, and given that an article 'top 10 restaurants to try
in montreal - number 7 will surprise you! ' can only go so far,
i come to ask your opinion!
do you have a place that you like? a place that you think has been 'overhyped'?
anyway, send me your suggestions - thank you in advance!
hello all! bonjour! my partner and i are visiting for the first time from 12-26 to 12-28. we're really looking forward to seeing some of the tourist attractions, and are wondering what the general vibe of the city is between christmas and new years. the live music calendar looks really empty so i imagine nightlife options will be limited?
hello with the snow covering the car and then the shoes completely wet
i am looking for a station (not too expensive) to clean the exterior and interior.
do you have a good practice for the car?
montreal snow info has not been updated since march 3 for the moment. is it still valid?
we are going to montreal over christmas and i can't find any information \*for sure\* that tubing will occur in any of the parks.  i've been checking all the parks websites.  has there been an announcement about it?
kanuk if you have the budget
kanuk. you can find it in thrift stores.
but it's worth buying a new one too. you would be convinced after visiting their store on rachel!
jeans jeans jeans has save the duck
i was born and raised here so i'm very used to the weather. yesterday was -3c. i had my winter coat, socks, boots, scarf, beanie, etc and it felt cold as fuck. 
when you're not used to it, it's rough. a parka is a good idea.
there's no snow. there hasn't been much snow before jan/feb in the last few years. 
but you never know.
thank you for the help! i was on the fence about a parka or just a lighter down jacket.
definite parka weather
how can i buy this painting ?
nice work!
there's one in fairview (west-island) as well. i just wonder how long those cake pieces can sit there before they spoil, or are they just full of preservatives so that they can last longer...
ahh yess! finally. a vending machine made for me.
10$ for a piece of cake 😬
these look so good! the only thing that is throwing me for a loop is that they’re made in hoboken? like why would we need to import cake from nj? there isn’t somewhere local that could do this?
there is one at les galleries d’anjou too
i got terrible explosive diarrhea eating one of these cakes.
i saw this while wandering around at midnight tonight! it seriously peaked my interest and walked around it 2 times lmao i’m allergic to peanuts so im not too sure it’s safe for me tho.
these machines have been all over toronto for the past couple of years. decent cakes, but not for $10-12 per slice.
i need this
i seen someone take a picture of this cake vending machine, today at 3-4pm! i would like to try it. next time!
hoboken, new jersey? seriously!? not a place that evokes confidence in those cakes and i am from jersey.
lol, you have to believe i missed it the last time i went to the eaton center! although all i did was go home, buy a game at the games tower, eat a kojax chicken yero before leaving, without really looking away or walking around ...
holy shit is that still at eaton centre now?!
i know what i'm doing this afternoon! :3
bruh are we really importing slices of cake from new jersey?
i was in vegas last week and there was one outside my hotel. feels so weird to see it here too.
i love this vending machine so good! i never got to try the cookies though ☹️ i don’t live nearby anymore ☹️☹️☹️
a lot of funky tuff going on at eaton's over the years. there was that infamous restaurant with a marine theme; and on another floor; a train
when i watched cake boss on tv i always thought he was mainly a cake decorator. his cake flavours don’t really appeal to me. they aren’t as exotic as something you would get from french pastry or even from a cupcake at les glaceurs.
there’s one of these taking up an entire unit at bayshore in ottawa aswell
where in the center? that red velvet at the bottom looks too good
wow i love the colors so much!
wow! they both look amazing!
wow! thanks for sharing it's vrmt cool!
it sounds like "fuck, there's a snowstorm, my phone is dead, i'm fucking cold, i can't see anything, where the fuck is the restaurant?"
mannn it's crazy!
the second looks like avenue mcgill college seen from place ville marie but a future cyber-punk version.
i love how these turned out! very suiting to mtl actually, i want them on my wall. tres cool.
damnnnnn this is so cool, beautiful really
excellent
oh shit, wombo created an app like artbreeder? i have to check it.
very cool, it speaks to me on a level close to my heart.
cooool. in addition, these are two themes that i love.
sheeeeeesh that's really cool
fantastic, bravo
needs more traffic cones
ai transfer?
that is so cool.  i would love to get a horizontal wallpaper of these without the framing and text.
wooooooooooooooow
very nice result
goddamn you people are easy
beautiful
>in a blistering decision released last week, the panel chastised officer michael boutin for knocking the man’s samsung phone out of his hand and then getting him to unlock it so that he could erase the footage.
let me understand: the "blistering" decision was that the cop was "chastised"? wtf does that even mean. it's time we dipped into the spvm's hockey fan teargas budget and used the money to stick cameras on these fkn clowns 🤡
what punishment did the cop receive? how is the most important detail in this article not mentioned?
yet theres no systemic racism eh legault?!
man fuck this shit
it should be a crime for the police to delete a video from a phone they don't own.
but the cop talk the truth /s
>wtf does that even mean.
probably something along the lines of: "aww, you poor, poor, little policeman. you must have been so scared for your life seeing that mean man in his big mean suv trying to film you like that. no wonder you got upset. let's give you some paid vacation until all these mean people forget about your little mistake and leave you alone. get lots of rest baby, and you'll be back to full power-tripping in no time."
a paid vacation most likely. 
said he was chastised and only mentioned:
> full and complete cooperation in the application of sanctions when determined
means the jury is still out on his inevitable slap on the wrist. they'll wait until the attention has died down before deciding i'm sure.
for that, there would have to be real consequences for them to do so. but that's not good for the system 😉
so, i know i'm going to be downvoted for that, but this article is crisp ... first image that doesn't seem to me to be in montreal (looks like the south shore, but maybe i'm wrong) then , talk about the van-horne viaduct and put a photo of rouen's legal wall (it creates a false feeling of vandalism and creates sensationalism), then put photos of abandoned businesses in the city center and make us believe that people are afraid ... but yet they like to take their vacations in paris, or barcelona whereas there is a phenomenon of graffiti much more present in these cities (which does not detract from their tourist attraction).
in addition, abandoned businesses will probably turn into unaffordable condos for the local population, so i can understand the fed up with some young people.
"the scourge of graffiti" oh boy, the priorities are not in the right place. imagine feeling threatened by tags, especially since montreal is known for its murals and street art.
i agree with you. it's very "pearl-clutching" as an article.
the only good point i could take from this is that there are a lot of vacant commercial spaces that are being tagged. if shops were to set up there, that part of the problem would sort itself out.
i also like how they also say (i'm paraphrasing) "we don't have any statistics but there is an explosion in the number of graffiti !!!"
and its international level graffiti.
small typo on the word ask: demadner
when i was little, i had listened to a documentary on the redwoods and i thought the antenna was a redwood on the mountain.
interesting read! thanks for sharing
probably not my fault, but it's written, thanks.
next up, i'll likely do the old port or downtown.
for some reason, i love walking downtown during christmas time, as long as there's a little snow.
not again... hopefully wont last two weeks this time.
thanks for posting, i would have missed the announcement
thanks
weird, i'm subscribing to city notifications and i haven't received anything, luckily i saw it here. has anyone received the notification?
beaconsfield somehow dodged a bullet?
that map seems useless
### water boil advisory has been lifted
not sure if your are in pierrefonds, but it did indeed suck when it lasted so long last time.
yes i received it.
beaconsfield gets its water from the treatment plant in pointe-claire village, and that southern sector of pointe-claire is also outside the affected area.
doesn't seem to be on the list:
nor the map, if you click through a bit.
'the labyrinth' at the old port had a water theme in the late 90s
if i'm not mistaken, it was across from the eaton center. it had taken the place of the palace (cinema with films at $ 2.50). you could enter from rue cathcart.
i don't remember the name. sorry!
about saint catherine metaphoria
are you talking about a water park?
don't you think of fort angrignon by chance? an amusement center, there were water games among others.
le cache-a-l'eau in boucherville?
it was not in the old port. i'm not sure it was downtown, where around
right in that!
no, no memory. it was downtown and there were arcades and stuff like that.
metaphor center? oceania?
yes your question has already been asked here. unfortunately i no longer remember the name but do a search here and you will find it for sure.
drette that and indeed the entrance was on the side.
wasn't that in the building where there is a five guys today who went into the fire?
i miss mirabel.
i had the chance to take off and land at mirabel last month on a 737 charter. we must not be great millennials on the list since the last commercial passenger flight was in 2004!
mirabel was the equivalent in the 1970s of the 3rd link of the caq. if there are those today who nostalgia for this white elephant, there are those who bitterly remember that the liberals of trudeau senior expropriated the best arable land in quebec to build it. and taking a bus to get to the plane rather than a catwalk, that was third world.
check this bizarre-o relic of the parking structure:
me too. when i was little and i came to visit family here with my mother, we always landed in mirabel. for me, who came from the countryside where nothing was happening from september to may, leaving my hometown to come and spend the holidays in montreal, it was magic.
the moment we walked into the customs area and you tried to spot your gang among all the people waving their hands on the platform at the top level, it was always very special.
it's stupid, but i had a great deal of trouble hearing the news that the terminal would be destroyed. i went there one afternoon before the terminal dismantling started. we had little hope of being able to get in, but just being able to look inside through the bay windows would have made me happy. unfortunately, the demolition of the parking lot in front of the terminal cut off our access.
it was still a very surreal experience, to stand in the middle of this huge deserted parking lot and listen to the wind howling.
rip mirabel.
eta: if there are any that interests you, the series "les grands projets québécois" (seems to me that's what it's called) has a 45-minute episode (in french) on mirabel. it's available for free on youtube, and it's really great. i highly recommend it.
me too.  was like going somewhere real special.
it was the terminal that made the place.
i don't really agree, mirabel is a much better built airport than montreal trudeau in terms of efficiency, noise pollution reduction and space. there were plans for highways and metro to the airport, which in the end were never built by the provincial (although as you point out the airports are feredal) for some reason… too bad, today adm operates trudeau for commercial and mirabel for cargo as well as aeronautical development.
yep i admired him all weekends going up to the chalet
> last august, the accused found himself embroiled in another gun story in laval. while thomas makdessi was a passenger in a range rover, the driver, ** zakaria zaki rouaghi **, was arrested with a loaded glock 19 pistol which was in his satchel, according to the judgment.
zakaria zaki rouaghi was until may 2021 a member of the youth council of the borough of montreal-north.
> in the past few days, instagram has removed one of its posts for violating its hate speech policy. the publication invited members of the muslim community to a counter-demonstration last sunday to denounce pro-israel protesters, whom it called "zionist criminals occupying palestine."
> in other videos posted on instagram, he treats an officer of the sûreté du québec as "stressed lady" and all the police officers as "pigs".
> in april, he also posted videos online in which he prided himself on having received, along with friends, a fine of $ 6,000 for violating the curfew imposed in the context of the health crisis and claims that he will "put all the montreal police on the csst".
> he also filmed himself in early may cursing employees of a big box store after a security guard asked him to put on his face cover. in the video, mr. rouaghi refuses to comply, claiming to have a "medical condition", describes the cashiers as "little girls" and threatens the store with legal action for violating his fundamental rights.
a charming character!
when your masculinity is so fragile that a single comment on your satchel sets off a chain of events that takes you to jail. phew.
"it's going to be a gucci satchel"

i'm too strong.

it's not a man purse, it's a satchel

ya shot 4 dudes pi yen didn't get 1? no worse champion.
in the light of the article and the associations of the gentleman, he is junk, i hope he will be in prison for a very long time.
his satchel went off the rails.
> the police also discovered $ 30,000 in cash, two boxes for storing handguns, a box of ammunition and dozens of pieces of identification. a seizure that raises "serious questions" about the lifestyle of the accused, concludes the judge.

after "godasse" at the hells, here is "sacoche" the boss of the banana republic
sacred it to me in jail.
i am pro-gun but they are not sacrament toys!
wow, he's a family friend / childhood friend of mine. yes it is clearly dangerous but it is not the prison which will change that. this man has spent his life in a marginalized fashion, he was often laughed at, his parents had their little share of problems, and he found comfort in drugs and then crime.
it's cliché but he badly needs help.
the famous influencers of montreal-north who teach us a lesson. 😂
when people in 2021 still do not understand that a man can have a satchel ...
it’s european!
it’s a fanny pack.

from memory, this station was announced long after the entire rem and was not in the foreground.
nope. construction is underway but the station will not be ready until 2023.
it seems to me that on the original plan the station was supposed to be under peel basin next to the hypothetical future baseball stadium, and that they changed it last year when they realized that the stadium project was doa
i checked and the station was not within the 24 advertised initially but was among the potential stations: 
you can follow the construction here:
they changed the plan from a tunnel to a bridge pretty early. they've been working on the new lachine canal viaduct since 2018.
that necessitated a station north of the canal for griffintown rather than the underground/underwater station serving both sides of the canal. there is still the possibility of a future station around bridge street, which could serve a stadium and/or residential development south of the peel basin.
if you are having a meltdown, maybe you should focus on getting help before even thinking of getting rid of your things.
renaissance? there's tons of them, but your transport issue remains.
i can help either with transport or a friendly shoulder.
post in local groups for free with a note saying no reservations. i do that in local parenting groups all the time and things go fast. you clear stuff out without needing a car and people get things they need for free. win win.
to get help for your meltdown situation, you can always call **info-santé** at **8-1-1**. you select the option for "info-social", there will be an option for "crisis situations", you press the corresponding key and can speak with a social worker live.
there is also **espace mieux-être canada**, at **1-888-417-2074**. it's in english, french (and even some indigenous languages). **press 9 for english**. you can speak with a licensed social worker or psychoeducator live as well.
**both are free, confidential and open 24/7.**
let me know if you have any questions! take care.
i put mine up on facebook marketplace for free and got someone to come within a couple hours.
eta: you need to be very clear that they need to take everything, you'll have people asking to just take a few things or wanting to come sort through it.
you can give your stuff to the centre jeunesse near you. they do a kit for every kid who leaves the cj at 18 to go to their first apartment so you can donate everything you don't need anymore. from clothes, bed sheets and curtains, to your old toaster and kitchen utensils. not sure how far you're willing to go to donate your stuff, but the nearest from you seems to be in verdun on rue de l'église.
i have room at home, if you can get an uber to rosemont, i can keep your stuff for a while.  
i don't understand why this is downvoted lol. probably best for her to keep the stuff and sort through it once she's done melting down. but if it gets donated, i don't mind lol.
you sure you're not within walking distance of a second hand drop off? no idea where you live, but there are a lot of them around.
chez doris or resilience montreal
forget your bags and get some help? 
get in touch with these fine people, they need such stuff and have a vehicle to pick it up:
maybe i could come pick it up. how much of it is there?
hey, are you planning to donate them? if so, some obnl pick up donations like
or write at this fb group asking people to volunteer picking up stuff at your place and drop it at the ngo
if you are not in a hurry to give them away, le support does home pick up. even if they say due to covid, they do not, they do.
is the woman still alive ? why she didn’t take her stuff with her ?
facebook groups: vtct do you want that - montreal
discord for montreal :   
kijiji / craigslist  
goodluck
i had never heard of them until now but welcome collective accept donations and will pick them up if you have large items or a large quantity of small items.
could be worth looking into : 
well this is a cry for help.
just a shot in the dark here, but if you were living with a female at this property, and she is still on the lease you can be held responsible for getting rid of everything. sometimes the crazy is worth the risk. just wanted you to know. if it's not much stuff you can rent a storage locker, pay a month forward then let said person know where their belongings are and how long they have to pick them up.
video in french available here: 
this project, as well as the new champlain bridge, shows that montreal is capable of very impressive public works.
there is a big penis next to the guy at [2:27] (
i'm sure that there are people who will complain because we put the roc in value while we are in quebec / s
after that they say they cannot dig to avoid disfiguring sherbrooke est which is also in the rock 🤷
it sounds like an endless video game intro. worse than half-life.
an english video will also be released on sunday.
so yeah, it's a bigass hole.
english video available here : 
the rem is led by a private company
chu a little ootl but it seems that i do not hear half as many allegations of corruption / collusion, or major delays and overages as under the tremblay / charest era
great catch
here i thought the most impressive aspects were cutting down transit times from u de m to downtown, but that's even better
i think they said that one of the problems is the underground infrastructure which prevents work. more details here: 
upac, amp, sct, vgq, big ... etc.
let's say there are a lot of eyes when we make public contracts
the rem already has its share of overcharges
it will come
it's easier under mount royal, no sewer and high voltage lines
it only speaks of downtown this link, and they just changed their minds for the end on rené-lévesque after saying that it was not possible. hoping that the same thing will happen in sherbrooke est, but i doubt it since the pr machine is well underway at the moment.
sherbrooke est and edouard-montpetit are pretty much the same ... nearby buildings (closer on em), nearby metro line, century-old water pipe / sewers etc ... when you dig in rock well below , it's possible.
most of these grocery stores are selling aa quality for aaa prices. they max the shelf time as long as possible to minimize losses. 
most of the time people dont bother with the hassle of going back for a refund. probably why costco is packed 7 days a  week now ; rarely their fresh produce sucks.
yes. berries, grapes and tomatoes, theres always a few moldy one
clementines too. at least one per box.
used to be a fruit manager for most of my career.
this is a consequence of supply issues greatly exasturbated by a lack of manpower.
there is not enough employees and the ones that work are less motivated. also not having enough staff usually translates in no time to do trainings which impacts the quality of the product.
all the products you have mentionned have to be verified daily and when placed on the shelf, but when you're missing staff, departments turn on pack mode when your only focus is putting stock on the shelf without any quality control.
also in the recent years the higher management only cares about efficiency, by constantly reducing budgets of manhours.
no supply, no stock boys, and it's winter.
if you buy from costco, look at the packaged and or picked up date on the big boxes. i wanted to buy clementines on monday(nov 21), on the box it was saying packaged on nov 6 , i gave up and bought some apples instead.
at provigo or others, depending on the packaging, you might find the info.
and yes i have noticed more and more in bad shape veggies / fruits, but this is all related to the container crisis combined with the lack of labour, happy 2021!
celery at maxi was disgusting, a real shame to offer that to customers, for $ 4!
you know you can return it to the store?
welcome to supply issues.
never forget that this job is done by minimum wage students who don't give a shit.
just had to throw out 2 new containers of blueberries... i mean, groceries are already a big chunk of the budget, if everything  fresh spoils in 2 days...
yeah, worse than i've ever seen it. supply chains are still fucked i guess?
iga in my corner the meat there must repackage it until it is unbearable. i don't know how many times i bought chicken (drumstick, thigh or thigh) or pork (pork chop, or homemade sausage or pork skin) and 24 to 48 hours later it was rancid and had a smell of not fresh. so i had to throw out the meat. this is where you tell yourself it's not for nothing that the price looked good, it was past date meat.
your first mistake is paying full price for stuff. i don’t buy any fruit that’s not on sale, otherwise they’re not moving enough product quickly enough for it to still be fresh. 
i only buy grapes, strawberries, cherries and raspberries when they’re on sale. otherwise they’re nasty. even still sometimes they’re gross, but at least it’s not guaranteed. i never buy fresh blueberries. i’ve not once ever had palatable blueberries from a grocery store. 
peel-on fruit you’re usually ok to buy when it’s not on the front page of the circulaire. oranges are still a gamble on whether or not they’ll be mealy and dry or juicy and tasty but the other stuff is pretty consistent.
look out for local fruiteries, in my exp it’s much better vs big chains
don’t you chose your own produce?
lots of news recently about supply chain problems and delays in shipment, likely making produce take longer to get to you.   buy frozen when you can.
twice now i’ve bought bell peppers that look completely perfect on the outside and then when i go to cut them open they have black mold all on the inside 🥸
as the winter months arrive, the produce is going to come from further away.  combine that with the entire world experiencing logistical slowdowns, the goods will be less fresh.
the worst offenders i have seen lately have been romaine lettuce heads and strawberries.  it is hard to find really nice ones lately.
another reason might be your grocer doing a poor job of storing the produce or the hour you go shopping.  you may be sifting through scraps.
nope.
it really depends on the grocery stores. in my area, not really a problem. the metro next to place jean-talon, i saw moldy stuff even in the frozen section, that's to tell you ...
thank you! i love your posts!
so there is nothing to worry about. nice! i can put my plastic in the brown bin this week. thanks
what happened in 1888?
records are meant to be broken
another 5 months until i have to pick up dog poo!
edit: a lot of people are down voting missing the joke and not realizing i dont own a dog
it snowed a week ago.
my post is just information.  you get to choose what you deem worthy of worrying.  this year's first measurable snowfall was unusually late.  if that does not matter to you, then go about your day.
lmao first snow of the year 15 cm
indian winter?
after living in the plateau, i understand! i found your joke funny. it's true that a lot of people slack in picking up their dogs poo in the winter and when spring comes, it's a minefield.
sure, which is why i put the word "measurable" there.  this was the first time the airport recorded at least 0.1cm of snow.
edit: i originally wrote "at least 1cm of snow", but i really should have written "0.1cm".
thank you weather man very useful
if they only start measuring at 1cm, isn’t it kind of pointless to compare it to older data under 1cm? because it has definitely snowed at least 0.2cm before today.
they start measuring at 0.1cm, and this is the first day this season when the airport recorded at least 0.1cm of snow. (i corrected my comment above ... i meant to say 0.1cm).
the last day the airport recorded 0.1cm of snow was april 21st.
oh ok, thx for the clarification!
lol that interview is a great example of so many idiots in the lifelong restaurant scene. 
imagine bragging to the new yorker that you punch people at your burger place. 
these kinds of people are so annoying.
nice. fuck that guy
entrrevue a radio-canada: 
pretty depressing. i didn't follow him much and i wasn't a fan of his restaurants (a little out of my range) but what he's saying in the interview is sad but true for much of the resto industry. he's talking about not just losing the hard labour but also losing the "brain trust". this is the hard earned restaurant experience and know-how. having experienced employees who know how to run the ship are worth gold and now they're gone. plus the rising rents making running a restaurant a barely profitable venture.
the pandemic has exposed issues with wages, skills, gentrification, high rents etc. the resto  industry is pretty fucked now and i'm afraid the future will be more fast food with quality dining being way too expensive and unattainable for most.
like him or not, he was the face of the biggest culinary institution in the city. end of an era.
it's warmed up like news
this guy is and always has been a tool.
he’s really annoying but has a great publicist!
that new yorker interview and every one since read like cries for help. i hope he gets the help he needs.
yeah trying to make people happy with amazing food and trying to run a business that employs people and treats them fairly.
fuck that guy!
just curious, i know the guy is an anglo but his french sounds perfect to me. is there a hint of an anglo accent? 
just asking because i hope to get my accent that good one day:)
hey, they could have kept the brains by not sexual harassing staff, making it a cesspool for addicts, yelling and belittling people and oh yeah: paying them a fucking livable wage.
i had to go to strippers with my bosses. i had to be sexual harassed and i had to watch as their business moved into costco and got another revenue stream. i had to watch them write checks to their sons and the mercedes benz they drove was written off as a busines expense.
but hey i was just a waitress. and my wages were subsidized by the clients. wtf do i know?
good fucking riddance! so done with that environment. left it 10 years ago and.....
i'm never goin' back again! *cue fleetwood mac*
joe beef is still the absolute worst "high end" restaurant i've been to in this city. food, service, ambiance, all terrible. had to move the fucking table to stand up and bother both neighbors. the place is a joke
coulda sworn that's la banquise, ma poule mouillee, schwartz, or one the mile end bagel makers.
half-kidding aside, joe beef et al (& pied du cochon) think rich, heavy food = better. overrated. for real, classic fine dining that won't send you running to a bathroom, try something like l'express or il cortile, or the ithq restaurant for quebecois fare.
normand laprise would like to poke fun at you.
screaming at and punching your staff is an interesting idea of treating them fairly
>mcmillan admits to getting violent, saying, “joe beef is the nicest restaurant i’ve ever worked at. but have i screamed at people? yes, i have. have i punched people? fucking yeah.
you're probably right though. everyone's mad at him for being too nice
a fraction of a hint if you pay attention, but yeah, his french is pretty much perfect.  he sounds like he learned french by speaking with native speakers his whole life, not by taking classes.
try vin papillon. much lower impact and much more veg
he also could've sent an employee to hospital by making him drink raw chicken blood. he thought it was a big joke.
i am going by the words of actual employees.
he’s a passionate person who has made mistakes but the vast overwhelming majority of the time he’s a wonderful chef and owner
one of the good spots is the ontario / pie-ix corner: a village of values on the east side and a renaissance on the west side. in addition, if you walk a little west on ontario there is a salvation army.
you will clearly find something that you like between these three spots there
estate sales : - i think rhonda bly has more clothing, but i'll let you judge.
[ 
[
there's a place called "the little shop" near acadie metro. when i went i found they didn't really have much men's clothing, but they've got a lot of vintage women's clothing.
thank you! i haven’t seen the tracey blog before so i’m excited. i missed the last estate sale by rhonda, i wish they did more of them.
so it will only become a huge shopping center with no mixed use that will further promote travel by car? it seems like a very backward idea to me. no ?
mont-royal reaffirms its status as an urban parasite. the condos were what made this project decent.
you have to read the rest of the article, he wants to keep the fence / hedge, he is thinking of reversing traffic flows to further prevent non-residents from crossing his oasis of the rich (whose streets are already designed to discourage transit ), he only thinks of taking advantage of the enviable location of vmr without contributing to the city that surrounds him.
honestly, this is one that i cannot understand at all.
what do the nimby mayors of pointe-claire and tmr think is going to happen to the malls that are desperately trying to build housing on their properties to have a captive patronage so that they can sustain themselves in a 21st century economy. malls are just not that attractive anymore. fairview, royalmount and rockland are all going to struggle if they don't get their housing plans acted on.
this project was the most mixed use possible, right next to rapid transit. 3000 condos in this context would have next to no impact relative to the mall being built. removing the housing component makes absolutely no sense to me. they took an easy chance to build a really good housing, commercial and transit set up, and just squandered it because of *traffic is bad there!**^(tm)*
lol. "must increase the density" they say. "build housing near metro stations" they say. and then a tata blocks 3000+ homes next to a metro station and the * same * people are applauding.
well, the news probably made my house worth more, thank you.
no this is not great news.
there were only two possible futures for royal mount at this time.
one is as a glorified marché centrale (pure commercial and office) and the other was  more like dix30. dense commercial and office with dense résidential mixed in. 
 neither is great. but some residential would limit the amount of cars coming in slightly. it would also promote some more small scale local business. 
if it's fully non résidentiel... ouf it's gonna create a ton of congestion. 
my last hope is that they don't provide much free parking. the only way we can control the volume of cars is by having paid parking.
the damn nimbys that prevent construction around subways are the cause of both transportation problems and pollution from cars. there is plenty of room in montreal so that everyone who wants it can live without a car.
town of mount-royal should be dissolved.
> according to him, the people of monterrey do not want the residential part of this
megaproject, due to the pressure that these new residents
exert on municipal services and infrastructure,
especially on automobile traffic, which is already extremely difficult for
rush hours.
still funny that he uses the same argument to kill the residential part of the project as those who find that it is precisely important to have people living there to reduce the need for cars.
you have to believe that the concept of diversity seems really difficult in montreal. already the project was not famous, if it just becomes a big shopping center with offices, they might as well kill the project right away before it becomes a big failure.
un esti de shit show this project.
the housing crisis? damn backward boomer
so, what will happen when tmr's residents have kids and they need a place to live?  the kids will go somewhere less well off, gentrify that area, and kick lower-income people out.  or they will be pushed out to far-flung suburbs, increasing car usage and traffic.
> it's a bit flat, he told la presse. obviously, this is not what we would have liked. i understand, the mayor is new to politics. it is an incredible large-scale project. it's normal that he wants to understand it properly. you never know, maybe they have good points, ideas that you wouldn't have thought of.
as i was reading the response of the royalmount project ceo, i was imagining him preparing a briefcase full of "gifts" for the new mayor 😂
i am voting to lift a siege on mount royal. literally cut off all routes to and from tmr until navel-gazing stops.
does montreal even need another big shopping center like this? who asked for this project? the citizens? pffft. i doubt.
keep shopping centers of this kind outside the island ... and keep the island for more local walks, more pedestrian, favor more "relaxed" environments not with 1000 cars fighting for water. car park. making it easier for pedestrians and cyclists to get around, with green squares and shops / restaurants / cafes to create a life that will last on weekends after 5pm. think that in my personal opinion (well i am who ..) a lot more interesting than a big competitor at 10/30 in the worst possible location in montreal.
and i say all this as a guy who has lived off the island for several years. this project i do not understand it ..
he doesn’t want to have a afflux of new younger less-wealthy condo dwelling residents that would change the politics of tmr.
why does tmr own/manage territory it only touches on one corner anyway???
been calling this since the beginning.  anyone who knows where royalmount is, knows this was a bullshit project from the start.
the only surprise was i was sure the condos were going to go up anyway, but the theatre, restaurants and mall were not.  this was ill conceived from the start.
>living in the sprawl,   
>  
>dead shopping malls rise like mountains beyond mountains  
>  
>and there's no end in sight  
\- [
ok so he doesn't want the revenue from the extra property taxes these new condos would generate?
i think maybe peter malouf might have a substantial stake in dollarama ( married the daughter of the cofounder,
if it's the same peter malouf born in 1952 ).
then going for mayor is to help assure he keeps his taxes low through dollarama whose warehouse resides in that area.
that's really unfortunate, but i can't feel too sorry. they had access to free immunization and chose to infect others. i feel sorry for those left behind, even if i think they're idiots.
get vaccinated!!!
more religious delusions at the end ...
don't you just love it when nature takes over their little lives and how they now say they feel stupid...
people in 3rd world countries fight to get a vaccine. here it is free and people come up with freedom and pro choice. someone mentioned it above, just lack of education.
[deleted]
i hate to say it but it's typically low educated people who  are dull of bogus theories. i've seen it with the people around me, friends,  relatives, co workers, etc ... they all have one thing in common, high school education with maybe some minimal post secondary. 
these clowns were posting podcasts on facebook this summer, you might still be able to find some but he took his facebook page down.
no sympy for any of them
oh well
i feel zero sympathy for these people.
have no empathy if that suits you, but atleast pay attention to the science. 
you can still spread covid with or without the vaccine. 1 year long studies in england have proven that.
he was planning on getting the vax soon.
yeah right. they clearly didn't care about anyone but their own selfish asses.
this article is written for a very specific set of people.
unfortunately, not only... even people with a university level education in the health sciences are falling prey to misinformation, fud, and populist manipulation...
yes, you can. this was never in question. however, the risk is greatly reduced (almost 4 times more likely to catch the disease, almost 15 times more likely to end up in the hospital, for the unvaccinated, at the moment). this is a no brainer. get vaccinated!
source: 
i am vaccinated, because if been forced. the government took my health routine away from me. i was no longer able to work out and do the things that make me healthy. i got covid, while un-unvaccinated and it wasnt that bad for me.
after im forced to get vaccinated when i allready have the anti-bodies?
the fact i wasnt able to work out at a gym, yet i could go by alcohol and weed, while not leaving my home shows how sick the whole situation is, no pun intended.
bouhouhouhou poor you, the badevil government doesn't allow you to spread your germs like you want.
im from poland, living in canada. you should never put all your trust in the goverment, my family history taught me that. they are people, imperfect, insecure and motivated by things not always clear to us, whether it be money, clout or tribalism.. you should always question their motives.
12 month studies show the vaccine does not prevent spread after a awhile. and many epidemiology experts think we will all get covid eventually. we have to invest more on covid treatment rather than kicking in the wind with vaccines. 
read the science, and come back when your ready to have a conversation. act your age, are you 12 years old?
even pfizer sponsored media companies agree with that science 
eating healthy, working out and getting vitamin d is more effective than a vaccine.
obviously do both if you're worried, ignoring the science and acting like a mrna vaccine is the end all solution is myopic.
and that's exactly why eastern european countries are being ravaged. their vaccine rates are abysmal and directly correlated to huge outbreaks and deaths. we are not a soviet bloc country here. yes, question the government but there's a reason we have things under control as much as possible. yes the vaccine wanes, we know that already.
i completely agree with that. critical thinking is always important.
however, i also disagree with the view that governments are always out to get you and oppress you.
there are areas and decisions that benefit us and are so clearly for our and the common good that it blow my mind people are still against it on principle.
universal healthcare, seat belts, privacy protection, fight against climate changes and endemic-level disease vaccinations are a few examples that spring to mind...

hey big spender, geeze.
restaurant da emma (777 de la commune in old montreal) might be a good bet. quality italian food, and not all pasta-based. they start serving at 6:00, and will hit your budget, even with wine.
wine bar okay with you? pullman for example?
i really like the st-hubert bbq at complexe desjardins, but hey ...
i see you put toqué, and i know its little brother brasserie t is closed, but has anything taken its place yet? it was one of the two container restaurants between the place-des-arts and jeanne-mance (on the quartier des spectacles).
i believe kamúy is now the other container (don't quote me on that).
everything that's been there was pretty damn decent, but it's a very small space. good luck!

possibly overlooked restos are the ones inside hotels across downtown and old montreal. do a google maps search of hotels in that radius and look up the dining/restaurant options on their websites. some good choices possibly in there.
maybe you can suggest a deposit? they might be afraid you'll cancel on them.

i have an older colleague who told us earlier this week:
“last week my 8 year old guy wanted to put on nail polish. in my time, i would have been beaten for that, that's 100% certain. [the rest of the group between 25 and 45 years old was quite agree with his analysis] but there, he did it then after that all his friends were flabbergasted when they saw that, then all his friends of guys are returned with varnish of all colors! "
it's getting colder and colder these days, but my heart is still so hot.
good day!
i changed jobs lately and it's crazy how less stressed, less anxious. my mental health is much better!
column from a high school teacher: i always find it special about harvesting food at school when you're in a disadvantaged environment for christmas baskets. usually, a privilege is granted to those who bring it on a certain day such as the right not to wear the uniform. there are quite a few students who will receive the said baskets at home in the coming weeks. at the same time, i am happy that we are making those who have more means aware of the reality of people who are in need. sometimes, some young people think that poverty is only social assistance recipients or people in the street, i admit that the first times that i was confronted with the reality of poverty other than on tv or homelessness is when my dad used to train us as a volunteer during the montreal newspaper christmas basket days. it's a good '' reality check ''
i don't do that often, but i like going to get myself a coffee in the morning; it makes my little daily walk.
even when the weather is bad.
(just can't wait to not have to put on a mask, i'm starting to get bored there)
friday is ravioli.
i started a so-called "fasting" diet. i opted for 16/8. i also returned to the gym. not all that easy. my goal: to lose 30 lbs minimum.
hey so i finally finally arrived in montreal. i have to take an exam on december 9th so i take it easy, i am studying, but i would also like to go out for a bit if possible. i already knew mtl when i was little, but that has changed since 1999 ...
oh and i speak english as well, so all en/fr mixes are fine with me.
coffee and bullshitting somewhere downtown?
went to st-hubert today to get my macaroons from the pastry shop. i wanted to take the opportunity to eat a bowl of pho.
googled pho on st-hubert and found an address not too far from the pastry shop.
arrived at the address, no restaurant. damn, they closed ...
it was there that i read on the door that i was with mr. pho nguyen, a notary.
google was not wrong.
finally the snow! i know i'm the big silent minority but i can't wait for the cold, it's just not normal no broadside in december ..
i potentially have a job offer in hochelag, it stresses me out a bit - my workplace would be next to the injection site. do any of you have work / life experience in the neighborhood? i wonder if i mostly hear stereotypes actually.
i discovered the coconut macaroons from the rosaire pastry shop on st-hub this week.
we finished the box in 5 minutes. i've been dreaming about it ever since. i go back and get 2-3 boxes.
do you have any favorite boutiques in montreal? clothes, decor, food ... i am waiting for your suggestions!
me who thought it was going to be snow ... good rain
i'm celebrating my birthday this weekend. 33 years. with family and friends.
i've been wearing my cv this week for a night job and i'm honestly fucking horny about it
i do not wtf is this
it's so much healthier that masculinity is no longer (so much) based on just external aspects.
ngl in the first half i thought it was the parent who beat him and not the others in the yard: /
cool.  
it will be fun when he sniffs the stuff to remove the nail polish !! :-d
aww so wholesome, i have a lot of hope in this generation! byebye toxic masculinity.
i understand you so much. i changed jobs a few months ago, and for the first time in my life, i love my job. like, sometimes when i have nothing to do, i turn on my computer and then i start working in my spare time.
bravo!
we sometimes forget that there is not a single job that is worth damaging our mental and / or physical health.
you ask for “divulgation de la preuve”. they must provide it before your court date
i don't have an answer to your question but i will say that if you're looking to contest a ticket, you better have overwhelming evidence that you're right. 
i had my car towed while it was legally parked. i had my ticket showing i was towed at 5:30am and picture/video that the sign where i parked said i was allowed to stay until 7:30am. judge said my evidence was lacking and only dismissed the ticket because she didn't believe i'd lie under oath.
i can't say for your current situation, but to be ready for next time: get a dash cam.
also, at first i thought you were talking about a motorcyclist. although a bike is commonly used to describe both motorcycle and bicycle, biker usually means motorcyclist, so to avoid confusion, stick to cyclist.
as someone else said at "the divulgation de la preuve" you'll get the backing of the ticket. you ask about a recording, montreal police cars do not have dashcams. are you looking for something else?
i dont think so. i mean even if you could, whats to stop them saying it got erased or wtv. they dont need it to convict anyway as the police report will be more than enough for the judge
buy a good dashcam tho bro, its gonna save you plenty of headaches down the line
what recording are you looking for? spvm doesn’t use dash cams nor bodycams.
how much does it cost?
from my understanding, yes you can. the recordings are considered property of the people and are used for exactly this purpose; protecting citizens and officers. just because it’s a road violation shouldn’t make it less important.
but at that point, it's the judge who's straight up fooling around, right?
so you’re saying op needs overwhelming evidence, but in your case the judge dismissed it based on her trusting your word.
about 120$, with -2 inaptitude points. i'm mostly worried about the points.
to me, it felt like a way to ensure i don't ask about consequences for the people that towed my car despite having no legal basis to do so. it put me in the "be grateful you won at all" state. 
this was years ago and i'm still annoyed at this event.
evidence for thee, my word for me. the lesson? hope to get a nice judge.
my issue is that the evidence was clearly in my favor and she just waived it away.
you can negotiate with the crown attorney. as it has been said: disclosure of evidence.
then you give your version to the lawyer. when you're ready. blah, blah, blah, i thought the cyclist seemed to give me priority after waiting around 5 seconds, blah, blah, blah. the policeman could not see given that (google satellite photo * it takes '' evidence '' *, photos on site if you can etc.) the angle is impossible, blah, blah.
you're aiming for $ 0, but let's say that at $ 50 without a demerit point (this is the most important, for insurance for example), you say yes.
you don't need to go there.
in short: contact the lawyer, ask for the facts, present the facts (photos, contract, emails, google map), argue for a reasonable doubt.
it should be settled without going to court.
not worth the time or money. besides you'll get them back in a year.
its probably just a tactic, i had a similar tone when the officer lied in his statement.
reasonable doubt ... very important! # 12angrymen
two years from the date of conviction. i’d contest based on principal to drag it out
drag what out? the point refund happens two years after a guilty plea (meaning from the day you pay the fine). dragging out doesn’t do much unless you already have like 14 points and these 2 points will get your license suspended… then you drag it out until you get some points refunded!
hi bro, check out the simpsons, it's funny and it will help you with 100% english!
really the music, the movies and the shows ... all of that will really help you. believe me! tell us your news in a year.
my mom is from a small greek village, learnt english all by herself. radio newspapers tv. she told me her trick was to speak english as much as she could . lived here long time, my french is ok. no one ever laughed or made fun when i messed up or got stuck  people appreciate a genuine effort. if not fuck them. taking classes is a great idea. also a way of meeting new people. good luck. your willingness to learn makes me have no doubt that you will.
it will be done by itself.
the more you read in english and speak / listen in english, the easier it will be.
the funniest thing is that you are going to speak in english with people who have the same level of english as you and that you will all understand each other, and that the real anglo will understand nothing.
good thing you are going back to school, surround yourself with people who speak english and there is nothing better than school to find new friends. i also learned english partly at work so when it's time to take an internship or try a better bilingual, if you have the possibility
i encourage you to do one of his programs which includes a dump specially for bilingualism and it is [free] ( anglaise.ca/programmes/). i did the explore program at cegep, it was a great social and linguistic experience.
ps. on the other hand my written french is always shit 😅
personally watching english series and movies with english subtitles has helped me.
other more radical but more effective approaches:
go to an english-speaking university, live in an english-speaking neighborhood, live in a shared apartment with english-speakers, work in an english-speaking environment ... have an english-speaking spouse ...
read, listen to movies or videos on youtube in english with the subtitles, so you can associate the sound with the writing of the word, worse if you games, put your games in english
> a year ago i decided to go back to school, for a bachelor's degree at uqam. i plan to eventually push for a master's degree. and i know that the world of finance requires an almost perfect command of the english language in addition to french. hence the why and how.
not that much. you have to understand it and be able to speak it, but it doesn't matter if you make some structural mistakes, unless you run into someone really snobbish and cabochonous. as for professional english, it develops quickly when you are at your job, the vocabulary comes back and you become comfortable in your role.
i also learned my english on the job, i grew up in the region, so english was 0 necessary, today i work in international trade so i travel abroad (when there is no pandemic) ... i quickly learned that english is even worse than mine in several large companies, depending on where you are going! not everyone really worries, as long as you can communicate, meet their needs and have a beer with them: p
hi! in addition to the other tips already given (consume culture in this language, etc.), see if you have the option of taking english lessons as part of your program. there are often elective courses or "english for business" type courses. if this is an option for you, an exchange session at a university in an english-speaking environment will really make a huge difference, because you can also make english-speaking friends, etc. there are mobility grants, which are in addition to the financial assistance already available.
there are already other great tips here (watch netflix, tv movies with subtitles)
but since you are at uqam, i suggest you try the english as a second language courses. there is a whole range of english courses available at the undergraduate level.
lots of great ideas here. i want to add that you can also read novels in english to increase your vocabulary.
there is no faster way to learn the language than dating and/or living with an anglophone roommate. the other ways is listen to radio, television and podcasts in english. read books in english, starting with visual books like anime, work your way into juvenile fiction like harry potter, and then finish with more mature book series. there is no trick to learn english but if you don't expose yourself to it more, you will never learn. i know little burgundy employment centre had super affordable language classes might be worth seeing if they still offer them.
i will write this in english to help you a bit. we live in montreal, there are tons of anglophones here who want to learn french as well. i am sure you can find an exchange with somebody!
aside from that, immersion man. play video games in english, switch your phone, watch tv, listen to music. just do everything possible in english.
[deleted]
watch tv with subtitles - it helps a lot to learn the right words (just listening can go wrong). and try to read, start with the comics and then the ya books (young adults). the ymca is very good, my partner took french lessons there and it helped him improve a lot.
great initiative to meet people!

film the new season of hannibal here xd

why hire an actress to make a voice that sounds like a digital assistant? it would be so much more flexible to replace it with a synthesizer ...
and then, i would expect more from an actress.
and it's not like it creates a job for a poor artist.
she will arrange with her mother's schedule to ask her to replace her
caroline is still quite well known ... and not just in quebec, she recently had the first female role in the hannibal series.
i think you're wrong with julie le breton (who played mm's blonde) but caroline dhavernas did indeed play monique jeune (mm's mother) in the flashback scenes!
i maintain that the best option was francois bellefeuille
"hey, those who go down to deux-montagnes there? well, stay here.
edit: before his haircut, it looked better
not a book but there's a series of documentaries from the mid 80s produced by the nfb and cbc that had the ambition of explaining to the rest of canada what was happening in quebec regarding all this independence talk from the late 60s to the early 80s. it's really well produced and does a good job of explaining the situation in an objective way. it focuses on the personal and political path of both pierre-eliott trudeau and rené lévesque. two very different stories and both are very telling about the different forces defining the political identity of quebecers. highly recommend. very well done. it speaks exactly about the line between the personal and political that are so intertwined in quebec. and because it's meant for the rest of canada it doesn a great job of giving lots of context about what was happening in quebec affecting everyone, not just those two political figures.

i don't know if that's exactly what you're looking for, but in 2016 there was an excellent book that came out, [le code québec] ( -marc-leger / livre / 9782761946414), which explains in detail several points that distinguish quebecers from canadians (and french). written by jean-marc léger (from léger marketing), prof jacques nantel from hec and economic journalist pierre duhamel.
it's not exactly about politics (sovereignty, etc.) but it lists cultural differences between the peoples of quebec and canada, given in support. you might find that interesting.
**imagine a population of people who came for the americas, not to be french anymore but to be a "new people".**
champlain, upon founding quebec city, sold the king of france on the idea that intermarriage with the indigenous people would accelerate the colonization of new france.
what history fails to mention is that champlain had, instead, for goal to create a "new people", neither french or indigenous but a new people with its own identity, not tied to and not answerable to europe.
>he (champlain) wondered whether the two distinct races (french and indigenous) could ever meld to create the new people he wanted ([srouce](
eventually, champlain got its way and intermarriage in new france became the norm more often than the exception.
this worked out so well that the king of france in 1627 felt compelled (by cardinal de richelieu) to [extend french citizenship]( with all the rights of a natural born citizen to any sons and daughters of former french settlers born in canada and to all indigenous people who had found god. the right to inheritance, to own wealth, to own land **in france !!!** as if they were born in france, obviously to reinforce the loyalty of this "new people" to france.
>the descendants of the french who are accustomed to this country \[new france\], together with all the indians who will be brought to the knowledge of the faith and will profess it, shall be deemed and renowned natural frenchmen, and as such may come to live in france when they want, and acquire, donate, and succeed and accept donations and legacies, just as true french subjects, without being required to take letters of declaration of naturalization
then this new people decided to call itself "canadians" and many were indistinguishable from their indigenous lineage while others looked more european, but all lived together.
that lasted for about 180 years and it was good, though lives but good lives.
this was so good that in 1663, the king of france, realizing canadians were a "distinct" people who he did not really understand, decreed the formation of the "[sovereign council]( which allowed the canadians to mostly govern themselves as long as france remained it commercial partner.
**then all hell broke loose.**
then the british arrived, carrying with them the "old problems" of europe and the "race theories" that were prevalent over there.
and the british conquered the canadians by beating the french troops, the canadian militiamen and their indigenous allies.
**the dream of a "new people" almost died**
the canadians who were the descendants of the former french settlers with a significant side of indigenous ancestry got pulled back into the "european problem".
* they were settled with a king they did not care for
* they were forced into legal and political institutions that were not theirs
* then they were involved despite themselves in the american revolution with the [taking of montreal and the attack on quebec city](
* then they were taxed to support the british colonial wars elsewhere in the world
* then they were [united by force to upper canada]( (ontario) in an attempt to dilute the power of the french population and had to sponge up its budget deficit. (1841)
* then the canadian [parliament in montreal was torched]( by a bunch of english fanatics who believed that parliament was too nice to the french (1849)
* then canada was created (1867) and ottawa was put in charge of the indigenous people **and the "canadiens" were forced to decide if they were french, thus could live in cities, or indigenous, thus pushed into reserves.** most chose to identify as french.
* then they were told to enroll in the british army to [fight against the boer]( in south-africa. (1899)
* then they were told to enroll to fight for the british in the first world war and [were shot with machine guns]( by the canadian army when they refused. (1917)
* then they were told to enroll in the second world war to "defend france", a country most knew nothing about...
* then they were told in the 1960's that they were no longer "canadians" because english-canada had adopted the identity along with the symbols of french-canadians, forcing the "canadiens" to become "quebecois".
* then they were told that canada was an officially bilingual country but soon realized that you can only speak french between new brunswick and ottawa and nowhere else...
**then you wonder why there is a sense of alienation?**
the truth is that the "nation of quebec" is a distinct nation within canada because **it was already a distinct nation from france** even before the british arrived in front of quebec city in 1789.
when the british realized the "french" were really the "canadians" and that they would be too difficult to turn them into "british citizens", they allowed the "canadians" to retain their language, religion, culture and institutions and even the civil code.
the dream of a sovereign quebec (not necessarily independent by sovereign) is only the continuation of this dream of creating a "distinct people in the land of north america", one that is not french, one that started as a mix with the indigenous people, one that had its own name: "canadian", its own culture and history different from france.
**the original canadians never colonized canada, the british did.**
when the british conquest (1789) happened, there were, according to the british, at most 60,000 "french" in the whole of north america despite 158 years of "french" presence on the land. meanwhile, in the six american colonies there was at least 1.5 million british colonists.
you can hardly call 60,000 people in north america "colonists", but 1.5 million is another story.
the "french-canadians" (really the original canadians) never built any large cities in canada outside the saint-lawrence valley (quebec, montreal and trois-rivières), the area where their indigenous allies allowed them to live. apart from military fortification and trading posts, the bulk of the "french" lived in quebec. acadia in 1714 had only about 2,800 people.
so, the "french-canadians" were not expansionists or "colonizers", they kept to the areas where they were welcomed to settle.
**the british conquest has turned that ambition of a "new people" on its head and quebec has tried to keep it alive since and will continue to keep it alive as long as they draw breath.**
so asking why there is a sense of "alienation" in french-canada is to not understand that :
1. the french-canadians are not french, they are the "original canadians"
2. their "canadian" identity was taken from them so they became "quebecois, fransaskois, franco-ontarien and such...
3. they are a distinct nation within canada, because they have always been a distinct nation from everyone else, from the french, from the british, from the americans and, today, from the english-canadians
4. they never wanted to be involved in european problems, because their ancestors came here specifically to be a "new people". that is the dream champlain had sold them on before they crossed the atlantic.
you may consider reading pierre vallières', *nègres blancs d'amérique*. also, the manifesto of the flq, which you may find here...
bande de colons by alain deneault just came out and is an essay on the peculiar colonial position of french canadians. akos verboczy rhapsodie québécoise is translated, and offers an interesting point of view on being independantist and an immigrant.
the first short story in atavismes by maxime raymond bock basically reenacts a fictive flq kidnapping (also translated), and has other short stories that deal with québécois identity.
if you want books not exactly about canada, but about québécois alienation, i suggest poussière sur la ville by andré langevin (novel, older but still pertinent, also translated), and une sorte de lumière spéciale by maude veilleux (poetry), which both talk about small towns and feelings of dispossession in vastly different tones.
i think you'll have a harder time finding a more contemporary book that is primarily concerned with english canada, since it hasn't been a main point of opposition/identification for a while. if you haven't watched [speak white]( it's worth a shot if you want a more personal/heartfelt reflection on the topic, but it's also older.
books by jacques lacoursière, the black book of english canada by normand lester and nègres blancs d'amérique.
just watch bon cop bad cop
i read two solitudes by hugh maclennan. it is a post wwii publication but worth the read. the mordecai richler demanded i pay more attention to current events in quebec..., perhaps both deserve a revisit.
i do not understand french well enough to appreciate the nuances from a francophone perspective/ publication; thanks for the other suggestions. i will give it another go.
i found *sorry, i don't speak french*, by former official languages commissioner graham fraser, a helpful backgrounder on the language socio-politics of esp. montréal and the national capital region. (ironically, i read in one review that the french translation was not very good!)
the anglo guide to survival in quebec by aislin et al.
[this book](
vallières in french
if you want to immerse yourself in the french-speaking reality of montreal before the 70s, read michel tremblay as the fat woman next door is pregnant.
it's not exactly what you're looking for - but if your going to read vallières - i urge you to read 'oh canada, oh quebec!' by mordecai richler.
[  
fear of a black nation; race sex and security in 1960s montreal by david austin. 
especially in the third chapter or so, he breaks down quebecois revolutionary political thought and the history foregrounding it. the rest of the book is a fantastic examination of the canadian and quebecois security state, and revolutionary black politics of the time and since.
duplessis by conrad black.
thank you for your interest! thank you for your interest!
quebec history for dummies. honestly a great summary of the story that explains well, but without being inundated with details.
laws 101
very good recommendation. i too watched this documentary, the first time i immigrated to quebec and took francization courses at uqam. qnf is an excellent source for understanding quebec.

the worst is that this young savage, pauline cauchefer, is praised by the networks of business women, who prove her right
by typing the name of this young woman on google, i was able to read other articles and i just learned that she owns several buildings on my street! i had a couple of neighbors, they made me laugh a little with their look and their behavior really bs, which was evicted a few months ago, it is mrs. cauchefer who bought the building! there is some work started that has since ceased. it's just left there, half-finished and without a tenant. very useful for the tse district.
really not nice as practical. once again we wonder when the administrations will do what to regulate questionable practices ...
> if she often works verbally, it is because "the human side is very important", she argues by email. “if a conflict arises with a tenant, then it is obvious to us that before embarking on a legal process, we have discussions with our tenants in order to find solutions. "
the lady harasses her tenants by texting and calling, but does not want to meet the journalists from la presse in person ...
i don't know what saddens me the most, the well-heeled individuals of the older generations who maintain a * status quo * which benefit them, or those of the younger generations who keep the * rat race * alive and participate in the erosion of quality life of all, but above all, those of their same generation.
i imagine she worked so hard to accumulate her starting bet ... calvary
his name is too close to nightmare: p
as long as the price of houses / blocks is going to increase and there are no regulations to prevent wild price increases for homes as well as properties, we will see this kind of behavior. on my street, a triplex has just sold for well over a million. at this price, compared to average salaries in montreal, the chances are that it was an "investor" who got it. the units in this house, however, are rented for less than $ 500 per month. it barely covers municipal taxes and it's pretty certain that new owners will try to find a way out.
anyway, it will take more than a small additional number of "affordable housing" to manage this crisis but our mayoress (as well as the opposition) really don't give a fuck and the fact that no solution has been found during the elections prove it. the money obtained by the high municipal taxes makes the town hall look good.
the fact that it is still possible to use the real estate market to invest to the detriment of others when it is one of the primary needs of all inhabitants, it is disgusting.
late stage capitalism.
this person is so dirty, she wants 500 properties? to gauge everyone around her? living is a necessity of life and this person is parading it like some get rich quick scheme. there should be a limit to this, and she says she bought a house at 21 for 600k with no help? my ass!
horrible
tax real estate investors who leave their units empty for more than a reasonable transition period. or investors who leave their buildings unsanitary for too long to be able to raze and rebuild new at exorbitant prices. or those like her who leave apartments empty. and let's focus on owners who leave their feet on the ground empty most of the time.
each landlord (and associated businesses) should have a unique tal number and repeat homeowners for renovations / unsanitary conditions should be fined in addition to tenant compensation.
it will cool a few! controlling a building that represents an essential need for the community (the need for housing) should come with greater obligations.
we are indignant, with good reason, but i am nonetheless curious to hear your solutions to the problem. if the govt gets involved, it only divides the population
it is his sales pitch to be “self-made”. but taking into account that she lies constantly, we can assume that this information coming from her is also a lie.
in these circles (real estate enthusiasts, real estate investor club, etc.) there are only sharks so they chase each other.
i'm willing to bet that she used a private lender for her cashdowns (see for all buildings) and that at the slightest gust of wind, she gets picked up.
these people pay for "training" where they are pushed these famous private lenders, so that the lender makes all the cash while the paulines of this world carry all the risks, and inevitably takes the tal (which is not severe enough for recurrences, we will not hide it) and often further (in civil proceedings for harassment, vandalism, endangering the lives of others, when we got them to dismantle the anti-fire stuff so that the firefighters evict the last tenants).
money laundering.
it is written in the article that his family is well off in st-martin in the caribbean. the problem with all of this is that they (speculators) land in working-class neighborhoods. who have a neighborhood family feel that everyone knows. make the alienations of housing converted into condominiums. this is what is causing a housing crisis. there was no such dynamic of owners, tenant that existed. in addition, now with the new insurance law which requires condo buyers to have the money to back the value of the housing units in the building at their fingertips. in case. the less well-off or single people are driven away from their neighborhoods which were 5 minutes from their jobs for an apartment 2 hours by car, the world no longer arrives. may have put money aside for one day also become a landlord forget it man.
the metro newspaper posted [this article] ( this week. i don't see why these people are celebrated when their parents are probably the private lenders
she comes from saint martin, her parents are probably super rich
her “self-made” woman stories are 100% bs. i knew her in high school, she was the typical rich mean girl. his parents owned several properties here and in martinique. she bragged about the salaries to seven figures of her parents. i was not at all surprised when i read the article.
people in general don't understand anything about life, no matter your network or your social status.
the best time to do this is clearly in the winter, there isn't any added headaches associated with parking in the winter.
i suggest "free if you can get out" or "free if you shovel out your spot" parkings.
bien tabarnakk, c’est bon ça! too bad i have all of the stores i need to get to without going downtown.
let's not subsidize transit, let's not encourage commerce in areas that purposefully lack it, let's just give free parking to shoppers in a neighbourhood where a minority drive or own a car. 
free parking comes with hidden financial and social costs that we will bear to the benefit of merchants and suburbanites who would not put up with a fraction of the chaos they generate if it were in their own yard. 
yet still the curmudgeons in the opposition will label them as radical environmentalists. disappointing but expected.
funny double talk.
i guess it’s a good move. there is just a lack of parking because of all the building projects going on. i was down there saturday and last night and everywhere was busy. reading parking signs is key
evening and weekend except that snow removal is carried out between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m.
the city center should have tried to find a compromise between the private contractors by modifying the routes and the streets a little in exchange for snow removal during the day.
however, the way the city center manages snow removal contracts it is a utopia to ask them that.
does anyone have a map where settings for free parking? atwater? frontenac?
free parking for 3
exactly the opposite of what should be done, the price should increase to decrease demand. and the price of the vignettes should be more representative of the value of parking on the street.
what parking… it's just mtn bike paths
there are more h & m and sports experts downtown. restaurants, bars, bell center, festival square, etc.
reduce traffic in stores? not sure that's the goal.
> glenn castanheira, general manager of the société de développement commercial (sdc) montréal center-ville, is delighted with the announcement because the city center has been hit hard by the covid-19 pandemic. he recalls that initiatives have been put in place to promote the economic recovery of the heart of the city.
i don't mean you're wrong, but it's interesting how traders think it's a good idea.
oh no! there's a street that has a cycle path! it means that i can no longer go downtown and use the 10 other streets nearby made for the car :(.
at the grocery store, they sell brussels sprouts, and i hate it to die. so i don't go to the grocery store for everything else. how dare they use tablet space for something i don't buy.
i'm sure if we take the% of space dedicated to bikes vs dedicated to tanks it will look like less than 10% vs more than 90%
please come back
poor ti cabbage. show us on the doll where the cyclist touched you.
but those who have difficulty getting there will not go.
you did not understand. you only have to look at the immediate effect without thinking about the consequences and the bigger picture. / s
how much hdr do you have
\- yes...
a tad overdone with hdr (handrails are glowing) but otherwise a great shot
nice composition, cool it a bit with the hdr though.
did you nuke the jpeg?
deathloop
it looks great!
looks like a movie poster. awesome!

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
very nice picture!
you said you photo shopped (if that’s the right word)it ?
nice effect..
dramatic!
i love it.
this is gorgeous !
wheely cool picture
i like this style. what did you use to take and edit the pic?
how i miss a world not teal and orange...
thank you :) and it was part of the effect i was looking for because i wanted it to pop for instagram as the shot wasnt for professional use
part of the effect i was looking for, this shot was for instagram not for a client or my page :p so i give myself more freedom to make it pop
yes i moab'ed it for artistic purposes :p

glad you liked it :d
i am a "racialized" person (absurd term) and i find the content of this article consummate insignificance.
an example of nuggets in this article: '' disadvantaged families and newcomers do not necessarily have the means to have access to nature ''. damn, there are snowshoes to give on kijiji, and there are plenty of accessible parks in the heart of montreal !!!
i hate this attempt to 'racialized' everything.
this article is so tasteless, my hair hurts.
i think there are a lot of underprivileged young people in life (racialized or not) who have never left the city to go into nature or to do outdoor activities.
going to hang out in an urban park at night, it's not the same thing
they never spent a night outdoors, saw "wild" animals or even farm animals.
just offering the possibility of offering that to our young people is a good idea.
when i was younger, i had the chance to go to a subsidized summer camp for young people like that; i really had a hard time. (camp marcel in lanaudière)
> in addition to being an outdoor enthusiast, jacqueline scott is a doctoral student at the university of toronto
everything is explained.
i admit that the savage nazis who hide in the woods sometimes it can be dangerous.
i find this article relevant, because as a black person who grew up in a poor environment in montreal (rue pascal gang 😂), it was really the school trips to my school that showed me the wonderful national parks of quebec. my parents just didn't have the money or the time to travel. in short, if i can contribute to a fund that would allow young people to visit free parks, i would be happy to do so!
it is raining today, mostly people of color affected.
ciborium .... anyone can walk in the street outside, right? indeed, it is starting to take on ridiculous proportions ...
if they don't know it's available can we blame them? the first time i hiked it was with work colleagues five years ago and since then i have become addicted. for people who don't have a car, it's not easy to go to orford, i didn't know that there was a group that offered lifts by bus.
>, there are snowshoes to give on kijiji
i am not racialized and aja
cadets are free.
yeah frankly there are worse articles than this one. it is very true that young people from disadvantaged backgrounds and / or immigrants do not do as many outdoor activities that are second nature for people who are better off and / or longer established in quebec (hiking in the parks of the sépaq, skiing, snowboarding, even vacation / summer camps, etc.) due to several factors, including money.
the equipment for all of this is expensive, compared to a soccer ball in the park.
very relevant to make the effort to extend access to these activities which are, in my opinion, a central part of modern quebec culture. it's good for integration too.
in the sense that people who love the outdoors are educated?
rofl
mother nature or non-gendered person nature?
it is something quite common in the united states that hiking is "white people stuff" in the popular perception of black communities for example. the same goes for swimming, in fact a lot of these communities just had no access to it at all.
in the sense that this is the kind of absurdity that has been coming out of english-speaking universities for 10, 15 years already. so it's not surprising.
this is what a kind of [crab mentality] ( that certain communities have among themselves and farting "* that the members of a group will try to reduce the self-confidence of any member who succeeds beyond others, out of envy, resentment, resentment, conspiracy or feelings of competition, to stop their progress? * "
lol, could’ve specified the streets instead of alerting the entire borough for one block
there's so many of these in a year, and odds are i'll hear the warning hours after i should've started taking precautions.  feels like i should be boiling my water all year 'round if i live in plateau just in case.
hiring on merit should never be an issue. i support equality of opportunity not of outcomes.
damn, when did merit stop being good enough?
this is a whole bunch of stupidity and bad politics, not unexpected from an american scientist.
he got grants rejected because he refused to fulfill some basic bureaucratic obligation that everyone else at the university is obviously having no difficulty doing. from the article it appears that all he needs to do is simply make a stated declaration that he will consider diversity in hiring or something, which he refused to do so he could make his stupid reactionary point. 
don't put your egghead politics above the health of your research program and you won't have any problems.
i have a lot of admiration for this gentleman, if you are reading this, well done for your convictions.
at the same time, shame on the federal government apparatus which has completely lost control.
"the canadian institutes of health research, gave dr. lana ray, a professor at lakehead university in thunder bay, ont., a $1.2-million grant to study cancer prevention using traditional indigenous healing practices. when the award was announced, ray said “we need to stop framing prevalent risk factors of cancer as such and start thinking about them as symptoms of colonialism.”" 
this is the part that interests me. what kind of healing practices are we talking about here and why are we bringing colonialism into cancer research? is that even relevant?
knowing how the engineering labs are staffed, i'm pretty sure it's a matter of gender equality rather than color of skin. i would have said that yes, finding women is hard in engineering, but chemical ? i have seen chemical engineering labs almost full with women of colors, so let me have some doubts about him hiring "based on merits".
source: spent way too much time in uni labs in this city.
this is a really hard issue.  when i was younger i would have probably sided with prof. kambhampati, but now i don't really agree.  we have seen time and time again that just the act of inclusion and diversity breed more inclusion and diversity which in turn promotes voices that we normally wouldn't have heard. he is a scientist so if he really wants to understand he should probably look into the research.
>“i think what’s happened is the woke and the social justice warriors have made a moralistic argument the way the religious right used to make moralistic arguments. and now people are afraid to challenge them. but i think it’s okay to say i believe that equality is a morally valid position. i believe that meritocracy is a morally valid position.”
sorry but using the term 'woke' and social justice warriors hurts your argument.  those are derogatory terms and not desirable for civilized discussion.  its not a religion, its math.  women make up 50% of the population, but i assume your lab is no where near 50% female.  hence why government grants probably want you to consider being more diverse.
it seems like nserc has been completely captured by the edi true believers and opportunists. look no further than their embarrassing response to the tomas hudlicky essay in 2020. everyone, including the nserc president, was quick to denounce what was a fairly standard conservative opinion.
the only way i see this changing in the short-term is if the qc government tells the federal government to stop forcing our scientists to pass these edi purity tests. there's basically no political pressure coming from anywhere else as all the university admins are on board with the program.
long-term, these are bad ideas and will run their course but by that point our universities will be filled with a bunch of mediocre researchers.
well, he has a point.
to judge a person on the basis of their race instead of their merits = being racist.
this teacher didn't get his grant because he wasn't racist enough.
first of all, we all know how fucked up and literally shooting in the dark looking hiring is. we haven’t figured out this hiring thing, yeah it’s pretty hard. anyone who thinks it’s easy hasn’t really done it enough and certainly anyone who thinks people hire just on merit is a dumbo (expect a reddit sub to be full of folks who have never hired a single person in their lives, and hopefully never in a position to do so. think overpaid software engineer who thinks he is king of the world for writing some lines of code some lame ass adtech company) yeah it’s easier to hire based on merit in some disciplines and industries relative to others but this “we only hire on merit” isn’t going to cut it either. that argument died 10 years ago so people be ready to have something else. just go do a tour of stem undergrads or even high schools and see how dismissive and sexist guys can be towards their female colleagues as well as the attitudes teachers and professors who are men can have towards them and then you got some dumbass talking about equality of opportunity or whatever. this is like the guy who is like why can’t you get an a in calculus man,  just quite your job and focus on classes, easy for you to say when your dad is paying your rent and has 100k waiting for you to use in a downpayment for a condo. there is no such thing as equality of opportunity. you must be some privileged upper class white man with the endowment benefits of having had ancestors who were colonizers, slave owners and coerced their way into becoming land owners to think that.
not recruiting based on merit is discrimination at this point. at this point we systematically favor pocs which kinda already taints what merit constitutes since some people were given opportunities they didn't necessarily deserve in the first place.
these are some big claims. odd that the only evidence to back it up is, "i’ve had two people say that was the kiss of death.” apparently all of academia and society is crumbling because two random anonymous people said so.
the tread over in /r/canada has lots of info in it for anyone interested.
we need more courageous people like this.
finally someone speak up about this.
such a misleading title. "he believes he was denied..." ok great national post, why is this a f***ing article even. complete bs propaganda
lmao this is not academia works and this article is incredibly misleading
it’s ranked one of the best schools in mtl. just out of curiosity, is this royal west?
i know a white guy who played the gay card to get promoted to the c-suite, and it turns out he wasn't even gay. his face can be seen in posters promoting diversity for financial ________.
i'm far too old to know it myself ... why are young people so hesitant to get vaccinated? they just don't care because they think they are invulnerable, or are they actively against vaccines? is it badass not to be vaccinated?
i don't know?  my son's school has 95% vaccination.  they had vaccine drives at the school and very few parents opted out.  i assume it is parents electing not to get their kids vaccinated.
yes.
[deleted]
maybe not invulnerable, but i guarantee you they have absolutely nothing to fear.
what part of the science says they shouldn't get vaccinated anyways?
less sick is better than more sick, with the added bonus of being less likely to kill a parent or loved one.
[deleted]
even feeling like shit a week with covid is worse than the vaccine. but yes, there is always the risk of infecting a parent or other loved one who is at risk even if they are vaccinated.
[deleted]
are the people at risk in your scenario vaccinated? where is the problem.
nothing stops the spreads.
vaccines significantly reduces the spread of the virus. every study, every single one has that conclusion. take your pick.
vaccines are not 100% effective, especially with immunocompromised. do you know the concept of group immunity?
it is my understanding that quarantines and strict lockdowns have been shown to stop the "spreads" [sic].
[deleted]
it is not true that **every** study has that conclusion. here is but one example wherein no conclusion even remotely resembling that is to be found...
after one, two, or three boosters?
fair, for humans. though in practice it remains impossible to contain/snuff out because of the vast amount of essential services.

more importantly, good luck locking down every feline and animal that can contract and spread covid. the beauty [/s] of zoonotic viruses.
covid is here to stay guys.. there are very few dumb luck scenarios that could reduce its relevancy (ex. negative evolution) but these are quite unlikely. it’s much more likely it will be part of all the standard childhood jabs we get (+boosters).
yes but at some point if you don't want 2020 level restrictions forever we need to rely on measures other than isolation to start getting back to normal. 
vaccines and masking are the easy ones. better to resume some normal activities with a bit of caution than not do them at all.
no, it’s not my job to keep you informed. i literally said every single one;
that implies you haven’t read a single reputable study. or just a summary…
it is not **'ect'**. it's **'etc'**, as in 'etcetera' -- which derives from latin, 'et cetera', "and the rest".
the sound of a frenchman who has just discovered the plateau.
could this be a leak alarm? gas or something else? consideting there's a garage, i'd call 911 so they could redirect you to the fire dept. if they don't find anything, you could also call the police (514 280-2222) and ask of it's possible to send your recording.
this thing is hardcore nuisance!
also, if you smell something weird around the garage, never hesitate to call 311 and ask them to redirect you to the hazardous materials inspectors. i had to do this in march 2020 bc there was a heavy smell of solvents in my area, and they inspected the garages first.
to me, sound like a turbine
it seems to come from the pipe coming out of the wall of the auto fix.
it is probably some kind of heater with a gas outlet that flickers. the problem is probably on the outside ... the gas outlet whistles with the air / gas pressure coming out.
the video makes it sound like a vacuum? it's probably the poor encoding though.
it’s probably something loose in some ventilation system, probably on the rooftop of a big building or at this garage. you can ask the garage to check their system, but can also call the police and they’ll investigate (i did it once because i thought it was a car alarm that didn’t go off for a whole day and they found out which building it came from).

my bad. it's my new notification alert tone. i posted a 15 year old photo on tinder and a bunch of angry ladies calling me a liar after meeting me.
honhonhoooooon!
i was wondering whether it's an alarm but it fades in and out at irregular intervals.  
there was a [similar issue in central edmonton]( not long ago, and nobody could figure out what it was. the theory is that it's some kind of vent or siding that's causing a sound when wind blows over it, and that's kind of what i'm inclined to believe.
what you hear in that video is exactly what it sounds like. i was worried that my phone wouldn't be able to pick it up well but it actually got it pretty clearly.
i second this. sounds like a large powerful wall mounted vacuum.
lol this is ridiculous, but it made me laugh 😂.
took a second to understand what you were saying though, way outta left field !
it should at least be notified to a 311 employee bc it's certainly not a normal thing. it's not an industrial park!

old munich ??
urban explorer types documented the building pretty well just prior to its demolition in 2011.
it's sad to think that so much fun went down on that plot of land just 10-ish years ago and almost nobody remembers it now.
the demise of le spectrum pains my inner music fan even worse. far worse, tbh.
old munich, for sure, with the oom-pah-pah band on the rotating stage, the balconies, the much defiled and royally uncomfortable picnic tables, and the beer wenches with their well-developed stein-carrying arms.
it was reinvented as le medley show bar after a fallow period.
i saw a steve earle show there one time. i think it was in the early-to-mid 90s. steve tried to play a mellow acoustic singer-songwriter type segment in the middle of the show. and some smashed out of his gourd dumbass was yelling out "copperhead road!" nonstop while falling all over himself throughout the whole thing.
steve didn't come back to town for a good ten years after that fiasco. that night a fuse (supposedly) blew at the theatre outrement in the middle of his set and he played though it unamplified with a roadie shining a flashlight on him and his guitar, like a champ. it was a memorable return to town for sure, but fuck you all the same, dumbass, for making me do without ten years of steve shows.
it is now condos, like the rest of that area
le vieux munich. i've been there in the past. it was a lot of fun.
leaving the old munich often left me fuzzy!
80? 81? definitely a few good times.
that was the very best. wild & unruly. the best vibe i ever experienced. the waitresses carried large bucks with foam spilling all over the place. at a given point of the night people danced on the tables. the bands is something that came later in their last years of being opened.
fuzzy laval
old munich is exactly the circular stage! subsequently it became the medley, mythical place of heavy metal music of mtl

thank you!!!!!! it's exactly that
looks so cool, i wish i'd had a chance to go there.
wow. the spectrum pics... oof.
best music venue in montreal as far as i'm concerned. huge loss.
this is so great!!!
i remembered a similar view, but probably 15 years later [
i totally forgot about le spectrum!!
>i love stories live these!, thank you
yes!!!!!!!!
strange to see the medley with all the lights on.
rip, this was my favorite spot. their tribute club had some good screeching cover bands too.

have you noticed that since the election, dozens of users (all with accounts less than one year old) who came every day, have suddenly disappeared !!
i imagine the marketing budget has been cut now that the campaign is over.
excellent, as in the case of trump it will be twice as fun to see them lose a second time!
ok.
looks like trump's maneuvers in 2020
possibly yes. afterwards, once the campaign is over, we are all in latency mode for a while. in any case, it is my case.
ps i have had this account for about a year, but i swear to you, i get paid per person!
😂😂😂😂good the conspiracy which begins to confuse the head of the world, i spent more time in the subreddit of montreal pcq was only interested in the subreddit to follow and speak about the municipal elections. if there's an event i'm interested in, i'll spend more time in this subreddit to follow it as closely as possible. same with the oscars, oscar season is approaching and i'm going to be spending more time in the oscar subreddit. i can assure you that i am not paid.
so true
do you find that funny?
do you have any idea how much it will cost the taxpayers?
ok ok, in b4 qq1 tell me "how much did formula-e cost?"
during this time a citizen who disputes a ticket and who loses must pay additional fees, if the recount does not change anything, is there anyone who pays the bill? or is it us ?!
it is not unreasonable to ask for a count when you have a gap of barely 23 votes in a large city like montreal.
this is quite wrong. here are examples of recount / judicial recount at the municipal level in 2017.
not even close to looking like what trump did.
i saw your check signed cenis doderre, don't try.

if i understand correctly, your french is functional for everyday life, but you want more: you want to master it.
it is not easy because in everyday life we do not reprimand others who make mistakes. especially if they can express themselves in a second language. in addition, french is full of traps into which even those who have always spoken this language fall, in verb chords for example. or just knowing if a word is masculine or feminine, there is no trick: you have to have learned it and remembered it.
i work with a lot of people who are in your case - anglos who can function in french and do very well. i often ask them "do you want me to catch you when you make a mistake?" and most say yes. so often after a meeting i give them a mini course. but it is not obvious - i am not a teacher and often to integrate a rule well you have to understand it. but it makes for interesting discussions and often they learn new things.
i suggest you:
\ - ask your loved ones to take you back if possible when you make a mistake. not everyone will do it, but it can help.
\ - try not to rely on your english. if you don't know or remember a word it's tempting, and normal, to take the english term, but describing it, using a definition, trains your brain to "stay" in a language. and it's more likely that people will tell you the correct term instead of just continuing with the english term.
\ - read in french, it helps to integrate more complex sentence structures and rules. everyday conversations have a fairly limited vocabulary, simpler and more familiar sentence structures. something more complex than newspaper articles. ideally a little variety, fictional novels will take on a different and more nuanced level of language than a political essay or biography.
\ - be patient: your french is already improving, i'm sure. you learn gradually by absorption and even if it is frustrating at your current level you make your way quietly. reading and practicing more will speed things up but it always takes time.
i’m in a very similar situation to your own (although i followed my immersion elementary school experience with a full-french junior/senior high school and only moved here this year). but then i didn’t speak a word of it for ˜17 years before moving here.
i think the difference between being conversational in french and actually *proficient* in french is larger than a lot of people realize. i expect you are in a similar boat to me, where i am passively fluent (enough vocabulary to understand what’s being said/written), but not actively so (enough vocabulary to express myself as well in french as i can in english). i think i can mimic the québecois accent well enough that people don’t always switch to english when i speak to them, but i know that i formulate phrases in an anglophone way (ou “[la] façon [dont] j’ai construit la phrase était incorrect”).
i’ve tried a few things to improve, including speaking french at work, joining french-only sports leagues (volleyball is easy enough, but wow is the basketball lingo ever hard), attending remedial francisation courses (paid for by our tax dollars, so it’s worth taking advantage of those if you can figure out how to sign up), and meeting 1x or 2x weekly with a tutor i found on italki.
out of everything i’ve tried, easily the most helpful has been meeting with a tutor. people will rarely ever correct our french in day-to-day life, but having conversations with someone whose **job** is to teach you how to speak properly will make a huge difference. if you can find a good tutor, your progress will take leaps and bounds.
my first language is english, but i grew up in montreal, my father is french, my girlfriend is french, i work in french, etc. i always spoke french due to the fact that i grew up here, but there was a period of time it got a little rusty due to where i lived and my friends. here's a few things that helped me:
* leave montreal, move to the regions. nothing will improve your french better than living out in the boonies where nobody knows what the fuck you're saying if you speak english. 
* consume all media in french. tv, radio, newspaper, your internet  browser, whatever. 
* shoot the shit casually with people from places that have heavy accents. you will eventually pick up their accents. i spent a chunk of my summer hanging out with some people from st jerome, trust me i adapted quickly.
your written french is very understandable, if that can reassure you. some gender (feminine / masculine) mistakes and simple syntax, other than that, it's admirable.
there is no other way than to practice to become good at a language. i've been learning languages for a long time, and the more you know, the more you realize that you miss them. it can seem intimidating and even overwhelming at times. don't stop and just bathe in the language. tv, music, real life interactions.
and most important: consistency.
don't let go.
i really feel this! i'm really not bad at french, i get lots of compliments on my speaking from people who have seen my progress over the years, but i'm really not at the level i want to be. 
i work in a french workplace but i still end up making close friends with those that are bilingual. i attend meetings and sit on various boards and participate in volunteer activities in french but the level of exhaustion i feel after an evening trying to follow a meeting in french is disheartening. 
i think if you're a really good communicator in your mother tongue it's harder to feel positive about your progress in another language. 
i don't really care about making grammatical mistakes in french, i find they're often mild enough that i'm still easily understood, but i wish i had more richness in my vocabulary, especially idioms and turns of phrase and that i was better at understanding that type of speech in others. i'll be following a conversation really well and then a couple of my co-workers with heavier accents and more "colourful" speech will jump in and i'm lost. 
i've decided that i'll take a sabbatical at some point and really just work on my french. i know i'll need a tutor or some kind of university program, i don't think i'll get what i want from just asking people to correct me.
uqàm has a certificate in french as a second language improvement:
or to put it less dramatically, that i can speak french but i sound stupid when i do.
i so hear you on that one! 25+ years i lived in montreal and no matter how well i spoke french, francophones found me to be "cute". don't get me wrong everyone is very nice and very accommodating when i made errors or forgot a word, but i could never make close francophone friends, only acquaintances. even from the family i married into, i never felt accepted, more of a novelty. i found this to be the hardest part of living in montreal.
exact same case pour moi. commenting to get some advice!
i grew up in montreal with a francophone father and anglophone mother and am probably in a similar situation. i still struggle often since my dad and i developed a relationship where he speaks in french and i respond in english.
what’s been helping me lately as i try and practice are a few things:
1. more exposure to situations where i can only speak french
2. deliberately trying to consumer more francophone media: there’s a pretty hilarious podcast called “les pires moments de l’histoire” which can help the ear and expand vocab
3. using a tool like fluent. it’s a chrome extension that translates parts of the page to french and helps you learn those words in context. great for expanding vocab!
i still struggle with m’exprimer tout d’un coup but the more i put myself in situations where i have to, and the more vocab i expose myself to, the easier it’s getting. good luck on your journey!
salute for speaking both language ma man. thats tough.
i'm not a native anglo, just an american who has lived here for a couple years and is dating one, but i don't know that there's necessarily a difference between learning french and becoming fluent if you are in an advanced level class that will go way beyond vocabulary and expressions. i've made a ton of progress with the ymca of quebec. i think working on grammar will help with your speaking as well - their conversation and grammar course is great and what i've been doing, but there is also just conversation. they'll give you a test and determine your level. there's also the free one from the government of quebec that i can't try because i don't have the proper immigration status, but if that's available to you, you might try it.
i also love all of the radio canada podcasts for trying to hone my accent and turns of phrase, then there is a whole french canadian section of netflix, and you can try something called "shadowing" where you listen to someone speak, pause, and try to repeat it as exactly as you can just to get the sounds down. there are some i think i might never master (the ai like in "mangerait" vs. "mangerai," for example), but there is always room to improve!
i have a master's degree in my 3rd language and i've worked at a corporate language centre.
i did "french immersion" through school, but i also have a bachelor's degree in french (2nd language). then i moved to mtl and discovered that my fluency (i.e. the ability to speak with fluidity and not stop to think), sucked! i had always had time to think before raising my hand in class. 
i've now been in mtl for 10 years, married a frenchman and get complimented often on my bilingualism.
here's how i did it:
1. as mentioned by others, the absolute best thing is to *ask francophones to correct you*. down to each article and detail. this includes awkward phrasing. increase difficulty as needed. what i mean is maybe at first they correct for understanding, but once there isn't much to correct, get them to correct your constructions. get used to the phrase "ça ne se dit pas", or 'you can't really say it that way' and provide you something more authentic. 
2. for comprehension and passive knowledge:
first, watch french shows with french audio and english subtitles. this teaches you to think in "equivalencies", not direct translations. sayings, slang and general ways of speaking. (do you have bigger fish to fry or d'autres chats à fouetter? ;) ) once you can understand 90% of that, switch the subtitles to french and allow your brain to work only in french. then, remove the subtitles.
3. to improve your fluency/fluidity when you speak:
set aside time to only speak in french. you mentioned having a francophone partner? tuesday is french day! or one week french, one week english. my partner and i do a monthly switch so we both keep up with our second language and get to speak 100% in one language. it's like a muscle and no matter how good you get, fluency is ephemeral.
4. avoid doing the classic montrealer thing: franglais! reserve that for when learning mode is done and you've earned a break. until then, speak only in one language at a time. when you hit a blocker, either ask how to say the word you're looking for and use it in the sentence or find another word/phrase you know in french.
5. your accent. decide what your end goal is and be pragmatic. do you have a good ear? can you make all the sounds and use them properly? do you just need practice or are some sounds too difficult for you to pronounce? if your pronunciation makes it difficult for the listener to understand, start there.
6. if my first 5 points are out of reach in your circumstances, consider a more formal approach. by formal, i do not mean group classes. your goal, from your description, is not to write well or learn bottom up. your goal is top-down learning because that is what is missing in french immersion. use duolingo, find a conversation partner or take private lessons. 
personal advice on your mindset:
1. get over how you *should* speak or how advanced you are because of your schooling. french immersion isn't proof of fluency, sadly. it's more like familiarity with plenty of vacabulary and a working understanding of french. the reality is we spoke using french words but it was more akin to directly translating english. kids whose parents decided they had to do it aren't motivated to try and emulate the correct pronunciation. they don't want to look uncool, so they speak with a heavy english accent and speak in english with the teacher isn't in earshot. the teacher can't possibly correct all the errors kids make and most are just going through the motions.
2. when being corrected, don't waste time explaining your error or justifying that you made it. get over yourself. accept it and use the moment to make a deliberate mental note.
3. people switching languages isn't related to the language or culture. it's the path of least resistance because a conversation becomes awkward when the message is clouded. don't take it personally when people switch. it depends on the person's tolerance/desire for decoding things. if your goal is to speak french without people switching, make your communication easy to understand by: reducing errors, maintaining fluidity and curbing your accent. 
best of luck and hope my novel is useful! 😂👍👍
i have long suffered the same problem... i think it's the accent, and more specifically, people's experience with listening to others speak with an accent. back in ontario, i noticed people from smaller towns/cities would have a harder time understanding someone speaking english with an accent than say, someone from toronto would. i assume it's the same case here, if a francophone is used to only hearing someone speak with a quebecois accent, they will have a harder time than someone who is used to hearing more variation. 
as someone who's been here for a decade and still runs into this problem-- i think the only real solution is full immersion somewhere where you don't have the ability to fall back into english.
the good news is that your french is good.
the bad news is that mastery can't be taught. it's acquired.
the best way to get there is to consume a large quantity of francophone media. as much as possible, read and watch the news in french. follow french podcasts on topics of interest. go out of your way to watch french tv shows. if sustained, you'll eventually learnt the intricacies of french. you'll stop making mistakes because they don't "sound right" to you; you'll grok french.
other people are unreliable. they'll often switch to english. media won't since it's read-only.
speech will lag behind everything else. it's always the last part to get right, since speech leaves less time to ponder and adds the complexity of pronunciation. focus first on learning french and then move on to speech, the final boss.
this thread is me. makes me more comfortable to know that there are more people in the same boat.
two and a half years is nothing! you seem to know you've made a lot of progress and i congratulate you on that. make french-speaking quebecois friends and you'll see exponential progress
i am bilingual, but i learned french before english so i am not in your position. but one thing that i can easily understand that is difficult for an english speaker who is learning french (especially quebecois) is the genre of words. an apple is a feminine word. why? because my c * l, that's why. in truth there is surely a reason but its remains so distant it is not easy to understand the logic of why an apple is feminine but a sidewalk is masculine.
i think the best way to remedy the situation is the same as for all languages. listen to broadcasts in this language, read in this language and practice speaking the language. it sounds silly, but hearing the language allows you to discover new words and hear the pronunciation of words you already know. reading in the language allows you to have a better syntax and speaking allows you to practice your mouth and vocal cords to the sounds of the language. me a english doesn't sound like a french. same for the e. its takes practice to master.
translation : i'm bilingual, but, compare to you, i learned french first so my situation is nothing like yours. i can completely understand why an english speaker would have trouble learning french simply because in french we assign a "gender" to objects. and said gender determines the pronouns we use in front of said word. an apple is "feminin" meaning it's 'feminine'. why you ask? because my *ss. no but seriously, there probably was a reason but it's such an irrelevant reason nowadays that there is no easy logic to understand. an apple is feminine but a sidewalk is masculine. 
i think the best way to learn any languages is to listen to things in that language, read in that language a practice talking the language when you can. i know you heard it before and it sound too simple and stupid to be true, but it does work. when you listen to tv shows in a new language you partially understand, you learn new words, or get to hear worrds you already knew being pronounced correctly. reading lets fou learn better syntax, what words comes first for instance. and talking lets you practice your mouth and vocal cords to make the sounds you want to make. the letter a is not pronounced the same in french and in english. same for the letter e. it takes practice to get it right.
i'm in a similar position - i get by fine in day-to-day, even in relatively complex social situations, but i can get lost if conversation is too fast or too accented. my written french is far from perfect as well, and i work with a volunteer organization that's largely francophone, so i really wanted to improve my written french for our members, and get more comfortable reading french so it's not such a slog going through any training materials, or simply coordinating with other organizations.
my solution, so far, is to take the distance-ed version of the francisation courses offered by my local centre des services scolaires, (school board, but not really since legault abolished school boards). i have been having trouble dedicating the time i should, but i feel like i am improving. i'm much more comfortable with certain tenses, and am improving, slowly, my knowledge of what's masculine & feminine. and it's dirt cheap.
you have to give yourself some time, that's all ...
keep up with what you're doing, read books or listen to music or tv in french ... sign up for group activities or classes. there's no miracle secret.
as have said around here; awaye ostie kevin, keep it up!
i highly recommend the program at centre st. louis. it's $50 for an immersive, 3 month course that incorporates reading comprehension, writing, and loads of conversational practice. there are field trips that get you out into the city to practice french with people, and there are "after school" social events so you can keep practicing with your peers.
i went in at a very basic conversational level and came out with way more skill and confidence. unfortunately the pandemic meant that i got stuck inside for a year and a half and lost a lot of the hard work, but i really enjoyed the program.
duluth is so badly paved that you could consider it pedestrian: p
to my knowledge, that's not bad ... even as in the old, i don't really know one that is closed all year ...
there is some anecdotal project of an old street converted into a pedestrian path: mercure terrace next to baldwin park, stanley park ave in ahunsic, gilford street on the plateau, prefontaine in hochelaga.
if we extend the definition a little, we can perhaps include the valois promenade (a former railway line) in there!
resentment
edith: why am i getting downvoted? groll street is pedestrianized
mctavish street in mcgill is a pedestrian street
> i do not count the 3-month temporary summer pedestrianization projects)
they are the best.
i miss the pedestrianization of mount royal every day. does anyone else want the city to make it a permanent fixture?
i know valerie plante is making rue duluth and rue roy zone pietonne soon.
there are a ton of little streets that have been turned into little plaza, little city parks.
all the streets if you walk on the sidewalk.
however, there are plenty of long-day tanks rolling over it ...
it should be though, or at least more of it.
also rue roy (between coloniale and de bullion) on the plateau (currently under construction).
i didn't downvote you (hey, an upvote) but maybe it's pcq groll it's more of an alley than a street? just because it has a name doesn't mean it's not an alley.
it is a green alley, not a pedestrian street.
the map
yes, but it's just temporary.
what i understand is that apart from a few places scattered around the city, we do not have permanent pedestrian space (year round) in montreal.
i was having a beer on billy kun's patio on a rainy tuesday in august and the traffic was amazing considering the bad weather. it reminded me of pedestrian streets in europe.
i think we should make the section of mont-royal between henri-julien and st-hubert pedestrian permanently, and make it a kind of shared street further west and east, like what we are doing. just done on ste-catherine street between bleury and mansfield.
it is true that that would be beautiful! with christmas decorations in december and then arrangements like brasero or other.
when you say "rpg books" do you mean like d & d game manuals or fantasy novels?
y'a [l'abyss](
[game keeper] ( in verdun! and i believe they are buying back cards and games too.
find out more from the schools near you! often there are play clubs
/video games. if not, maybe the libraries or the fun cafes? if you are going to sell them you can donate the money to an npo afterwards like big brothers / sisters of montreal, youth center etc.
besides, i really enjoyed playing * mice and mystics * with a friend's children. it was a good introduction to dungeons and dragons (depending on the age of the children).
in montreal, i only know the valet de coeur. if you go to quebec, go to the imaginary at place laurier, it's 3-4 times the size of the valet de coeur.
at geeks
- game keeper a verdun
- crossover comics on notre-dame
plaza st-hubert are some cool shops
to get you some, the other comments have targeted the right stores in montreal.
as for the manuals you are looking to get rid of, if you are looking to sell them and not give them away, i would potentially advise looking at their value on ebay as those out of print can get a good price. (ex. the dark heresy system from warhammer 40k, i don't see any copies of the second edition manual available)
forget my warning if you want to give them!
there is l'expedition and carta magica on rue st hubert, as well as face to face and gamekeeper in verdun. if you're ready to move around a bit, i really like 3 dragons on the north rim.
to buy the old and rare rpg stuff, in my experience ebay is the best source. it takes a little patience.
if your children are still small (4-6 years old), [the series my first adventure] ( is very popular with us. i buy them from randolph.
port de tête on mont royal (francophone) and drawn and quarterly (anglophone) in the mile end have sections for children (and adults!) rather formidable. i strongly recommend them!
the imaginaire store at st-bruno promenades might have some.
the abyss on jean-talon has a good selection if memory serves: 
also, if you are not afraid of pdfs, the site  is a real gold mine at good prices.
ah i see that you want to sell too: look for marketplace groups on facebook of local players and advertise your books in the marketplace group (my phone is english, sorry i don't have the translation handy): this way your ad goes target the right audience straight away and you will have fewer bad customers to deal with. this is what i do for my board games and i was still able to sell enough hassle-free games of idiots that waste your time.
plus genre game manuals.  
thanks, the abyss looks interesting, i like the randolph style concept!
and they buy your second hand books. not masses, ie i was given $ 5 per pathfinder book, but dnd books can still be expensive, there are collectors.
+1 for chez geeks
big fan of cross over personally, they are really nice and even if their inventory is sometimes a little low, they can order anything from you.
one of the co-owners was developing his own boardgame (before covid), i printed his prototypes!
this store is really a gold mine for all fans of rpg, boards games and cards
i know who you're talking about. i was on the first kickstarter. :)
what's with the english signs?
big moment in my childhood was going to the paramount cinema (now scotia bank) and passing by that place. i couldn't believe such a thing was allowed to exist in plain sight.
now that's fine art, love it!
you took a little liberty with the signage 😉
the saddest thing for me is that the five guys are also on fire :(
you are officially awesome.
woow handsome work
the real tragedy is the five guys being closed...
good picture,  good job. truly a sad day part of my youth went up in flames. 🔥🔥
super sex
great job!
[neighbours are all restos but the sexe was too hot!! rip 5guys](
gotta have cones.
i'm not from montreal, can someone explain it to me?
cool drawing! do you do custom work?
where's the 5 guys? the real tragedy! /jk
i think i was, there maybe thirty five years ago. 
its a shame 😔
i need that supersex sign for my room!
disappointed i never bought a shirt from there lol
awesome!
94.7 hits fm had its last broadcast in september. the station closed down. someone else must have taken the frequency.
with that and mc mario being cut after 30 years at virgin radio, the end of the world is approaching.
doesn’t surprise me- commercial radio is dead, and the pop music radio stations of montreal have gotten worse over the last decade. 
i’m honestly surprised that the beat 92.5 and virgin radio 95.9 are still on the air.
wow it says a lot that i haven’t noticed this for almost 2 months, despite being programmed into my car radio.
>wqlr is a non-commercial religious fm radio station licensed to chateaugay, new york owned by the educational media foundation airing the emf's k-love contemporary christian format.
i miss 94.7. i would listen to it everyday for like 10 years. times are changing i guess
i never listens to 94.7
i use to listen to virgin radio back when it was natasha and freeway frank and they fire him.
i boycott that radio and not switch to beat fm 92.5
they were sold to some christian radio network consortium. 94.7 broadcasts out of the usa, it’s a boarder blaster station that did a semi decent job at making itself appear “local”.
was this the kanawake station?
some more info here: 
likewise i was pretty shocked when they started playing christian music
never been a fan of "hits" stations although i don't know about this specific one.
best music show on the radio for me is after dark with odario williams on cbc music. the man is so good.
i had it programmed in my car… and i couldn’t for the life of me understand why i saved a station with songs of praise. thanks!!
have a look at what their final day and final minutes were like: 
wow. i have been puzzled for months! they were my favourite :(
my childhood. that is so sad. wow.
mc mario, were you the friday night dj at 95.9?
fun fact, i know some people that did coke with him when they were 17-19 and he was in his 40s. dude is a fucking weirdo.
oh no. i listen to the radio then it appears. :(
im honestly surprised how the beat and virgin are alive still as they play the same songs from the same play list *every day*. not even new songs either. 
i don't know why but the beat *really* likes playing for '90's throwback' culture beat's *mr. vain* or la bouche's *be my lover*.  i love those songs but holy shit, there's other hit 90's songs you can play than those two.
im wondering on how mike fm will do as they plan to bring something similar to club nights on thursday and friday nights. i wouldn't mind if it be something of the 90's music.

i go to concordia and this might sound biased, but generally speaking mcgill is it's "own world". the residences, buildings, staff, profs, and students are living in a separate world. not a single word of french aside from merci and bonjour, and most international students, canadian students, and even local anglophones don't even attempt to speak the language. mostly because all their surroundings doesn't either. most of my colleagues at concordia speak french, and most of the international students i've met ( that come mostly from qatar, dubai, saudi arabia) were enrolled in some " lycée francais" in the middle east ( learning french is a  popular thing among upper social classes there)  speak french. i can't blame those that don't speak, well because they dont "have to" since they get served in english pretty much everywhere ( everywhere aka downtown). it kinda sucks for the rest of us local quebecers that had to do mandatory french classes in cegep and what not and seeing these people getting away with nothing and graduating earlier
not very surprising from mcgill.
mcgill is unfortunately very francophobic.
when it is not members of the staff who make you feel like shit if you speak to them in french, it is the canadian or american students who despise you. ** this is not qwebec, you're at mcgill here. **
and if you have the misfortune to be francophone and white ... oh boy! you're the cause of everything wrong in this shitty province.
and this behavior becomes internalized by quebec employees and students.
the worst part is that mcgill is a great university with really top graduate programs and labs.
mcgill is gonna mcgill
oh boy more overblown outrage ammo for legault to use to pour more money into the oqlf.
maybe he'll take it away from hospitals or infrastructure this time.
i went to mcgill and i met quite a few people, even from out of province or other countries, who were smart enough to make the most of their time in montreal to learn french or some french at least. they left with a diploma and an extra language. that's pretty smart. unfortunately many more did not seize the opportunity and that's just too bad for them.
oh wow an anglophone university not offering a program in french this is outrageous
hahaha that's the most mcgill thing possible. i studied there, and as a native of montreal it was just weird from edge to edge as an experience.
not surprisingly. i taught french at mcgill precisely (not at this school, however, in another department). many of my students had decided to learn french after 1-2 years at uni without having learned basic words. yet they lived in montreal ...
i have couple of friends studying in mcgill. none of them actually speak french, not even on a daily basis, also there are so so many international students at mcgill its not easy for them to just start speaking french at once i mean :/ i expect this
french students and local students do communicate between themselves in french, if that matters.
when will the mcgill français movement return?
this discussion reminds me so much of the short story north by clark blaise. the part where the mom made her boy skip school to go meet the old jewish lady in the ghetto to discuss the boy's education.
here’s the wikipedia section on this topic. how is imposing another colonial language, french, on an english speaking university with 30% international students, any better? quebec sure tries hard to erase centuries of anglo history in the province.
“mcgill is one of three english-language universities in quebec;[152] french is not a requirement to attend.[153] the faculty of law does, however, require all students to be 'passively bilingual' since english or french may be used at any time.[154] over 40,000 students attend mcgill, with international students accounting for approximately 29 percent of the student population.[155] the majority of students are fluent in at least two languages.[156] francophone students, whether from quebec or overseas, now make up approximately 20 percent of the student body.[155]
although the language of instruction is english, since its founding mcgill has allowed students to write their thesis in french, and since 1964 students in all faculties have been able to submit any graded work in either english or french, provided the objective of the class is not to learn a particular language.[157] the university has a bilingual language policy and charter.”
about time
the target audience seem to not understand french. would a french version be needed.
and how is this news worthy?
yeah, the "mcgill bubble" is absolutely a thing
yeah, mcgill is absolutely its own little world. i would say professional degree programs like law, medicine and education are the exception, since a) students are more likely to be locals and b) anyone wanting to work in those fields in quebec (esp. law) needs to have a strong command of french.
that's unfair assessment. i have two degrees, one from concordia and one from mcgill. for those who are from qubec, they can speak french. mcgill has a bigger portion of people who weren't qc resident (almost two third, whereas at concordia two third were qc resident) and it's normal that at mcgill, we use english more exclusively because we work with people with different backgrounds, whereas at concordia, there are more local people who can speak french. besides, i select mon entourage not because of which language they speak but because of who they are.
thought this was going to be about the wages.
why not go and demonstrate in mcdonald's, burger king, harveys or other big chains? well no, it's more fun to bang on the head of restaurants in quebec that are struggling to survive.
i don't eat meat, among other things because i believe that the good of animals takes precedence over what i put in my mouth. but i still find it completely amazing to go into restaurants and do such actions. at worst, stay in the public space ... the sidewalk.
having said that, 25-30 years ago, my father was in charge of 4 pigsties. i helped him with certain tasks. the pig pens were cleaned every day. although the pens are "small", pigs usually do not defecate in the same place where they eat. on the other hand, you have to clean it often if you don't want there to be shit everywhere.
if there is one who takes care of his animals, it is martin picard. frankly, this is rubbish.
there's proper ways of protesting stuff and this isn't one of them. scaring people in the restaurant is using fear to get what you want, using fear makes you no better then the people are you protesting.
i don’t think it’s the first time animal cruelty activist have protested au pied de cochon.
[deleted]
lazy and ineffective.
taken up by ctv news. official source [here] (
isn't this a weird choice for an anti meat protest? they grow their own food for the restaurant, am i wrong? wouldn't this make better sense at a grocery store or generic restaurant that doesn't specialize in local farm foods?
i am hungry.
i would have given them a big pig kick in the buttocks. (it's a joke there).
but i would have called 911 without waiting.
don’t these people have better things to do?
mentally ill.
this is not norriture!
this is violence!
... which tastes good in tabarnac.
ya and all of them wearing clothes made by 2 year olds from china. please gtfo with your bs. losers.
i keep reminding vegans that if it wasn't for us meat eaters,  cows, pigs, lambs, etc... would be extinct.
how to have a thick dlair. well done
world class. champions of the animal world.
i would invite one to eat at the next supper.
a day can’t go by in montreal, without a protest of some sort
same here. very disapointed they are choosing such a cliché subject as meat consumption. in addition, to better protest, go to the farms directly, block trucks carrying meat. i'm no saying we should keep consuming meat the exact same way we do, but if you want to rally people to your cause, don't ruin their weekend night.
14 young garbage drains that will be released in the coming days ...
as long as the judiciary does not wake up, it's a sword in the water
glad to see the police forces have not been around for a long time with the increase in incedents of firearms.
i would say more like in the jello. you damn it that won't do much. but if you keep kicking for a while, the jello goes away.
[deleted]
worse, they are going to kill with knives and their families make them cry that we are not sad
if they are able to easily find 15 weapons like that in a few days, imagine the number of weapons that are in circulation ...
when it comes to a question of hours and ages so different, it is more young people who talk ...
how often do you punch your jell-o?
it is the young garbage dumps that use it to kill children in the middle of the street.
the job of the judiciary is to protect society from people with anti-social and violent behavior.
rehabilitation is the job of the state, by the way, not the judiciary ...
it is not trivial to acquire and be in possession of a firearm, not to have legal repercussions is to trivialize firearms.
don't just trust the title of the article for once.
* avoid cost explosion *
that said, the bill for the project, valued at $ 10 billion, will have to remain reasonable, believes françois legault. the prime minister is not ruling out increasing his government's funding as needed, but for now, he prefers to remain cautious on the subject.
“at this point, we are not ruling anything out,” he said. you know, we are talking about a cost of about 10 billion ... if everything had to be buried, it would be 20 billion. that would not be acceptable. ”
if only he said the same thing on the 3rd link ...
you're not my mom!
yet.
auntie-mom!
aren't aboriginal reserves a strainer for the black market in guns?
i remember reports from the 1980s showing contraband coming in through akwesasne. we have known for a long time that this is the problem, but the federal government refuses to face it.
and meanwhile, plante / legault / trudeau want to attack legal gun owners.
so much effort wasted for no return. imagine if the money and time invested in the legal gun buyback program went instead to border control and aid to communities at risk! but no, let's waste our time hitting the wrong nail.
my boyfriend tells me that it comes from 3d printers. hey tabarnak that it came out of the ass in tabarnak as an idea.
gunlandia aka usa
the duck hunters again ...
aboriginal
3d printers?
yes. 
* we recognize that this shootout is taking place in unceded territory. *
apart from the debate on the rights of the amerindians, would it not be possible to have a double border, that is to say a control at the exit of the reserve, which obviously would not be imposed for the members of the clan?
i saw that on a map recently that cornwall island appears to be an island virtually unguarded by any of the customs agencies. canadian customs is on the canadian side, american customs is on the american side, so each side can bring 100 lbs of coke, drop everything on the island and come back as if nothing happened.
> we have known for a long time that this is the problem, but the federal government refuses to face it.
do you really want an oka 2.0 crisis?
it's not as if it didn't exist .... but you can be sure that if the polish had seized some, even if only once, he would have presented it with very very great fanfare during a special press conference.
only the frame receiver can be 3d printed. you can't really 100% 3d print a fully functioning firearm.
then you have to purchase the barrel, slide, action, magazine, even bullets etc. - gun stores in the country won't sell you any of these items without a gun license. so they order/smuggle them from the states just the same.
> which obviously would not be taxed for members of the clan
what would it be like, then?
this is one of the possibilities, but 1- a large part of the contraband leaves by boat from the reserve. 2- do not impose it for the members of the clan, that defeats the purpose of the thing a little, no?
do you think the problem should not be tackled because we are threatened with armed violence?
we cannot tolerate territories where the law does not reign, and even less have such territories on the border.
so the easiest method is still : acquire a firearm illegally. 3d printing does nothing to change that
look up the fgc9. less than 500 $ us to make, everything is 3d printed or purchased at a hardware store. pretty crazy.  
but yeah, when you can simply buy an untraceable 9mm for 300 $ cad ...
not really related but i thought i'd mention you can get shrooms by mail order from bc. good quality product from a reputable company at fair prices. $70 minimum order though (payable by e-transfer only). sucks if you want to sample all the different types.
nothing more permanent than a temporary solution put in place by the government.
they want air to know!
if we wait after unanimity, it will be long.
cdpq infra is more interested in real estate development than in creating a system that serves the existing population. they place the stations near undeveloped land in order to maximize the royalties that real estate developers will have to pay them ($ 112 / square meter for new constructions 1km around the stations).
when will we see the "55 years after taking office, the montreal metro is still not unanimous"?
but yé air in the west. on the other hand, we don't already have two metro lines, so we can't afford to whine
the drone shots over the current construction sites are really beautiful.
"we want more public transport in the east of the island"
ah well there perfect
"we don't want public air transport in the east"
ah okay we're going to put a part underground because the whole thing will be too expensive.
"naaaaaon we do not want pentoute deins airs"
.....
i hate how, given that we are talking about public transport, some people have to automatically tear their shirts off by defending the project from any criticism and accusing everyone of being nimby or pro char.
the truth is that it is a fucking rushed project of megalomaniac dad legault, without any consultation with any municipal or intermunicipal organization (artm), which poorly serves the target population and which has a very long-term impact on our city. we have had enough of drapeau who scrapped the city without consultation in the name of progress.
well everyone gets shaved with air except for saint leonard, yeah weird that.
what's the problem with above ground? noise? because at all hours of the day, jackasses who ignore the speed limit use boulevard st jean baptiste as a racing strip that you can hear several streets away -- right next to an old person's retirement house -- so i don't think a tram would be any noisier.
edit: and the guy complaining about noise lives next to a highway... surprising he didn't mind they highway
made me laugh out loud while browsing reddit in the bathtub. thx my dude
its kind of a theme in urban planning circles at this point.
we should stop trying to make everyone happy. we can take citizens' concerns and try to address them, but a few citizens should not have the right to veto a project that will benefit the city as a whole.
that doesn't mean we can't have a better process. it is ridiculous that the artm was not involved in a case like this one.
100% agree.
at the same time, it's better than radisson and hb which are next to neighborhoods of single-family homes ...
haha we have a 100% remake of that with the extension of the blue line.
imagine if they proposed to build a metro today. "but it'll take decades and it's gonna cost billions!"
i think it creates less controversy in the west since it does not happen in residential neighborhoods!
nimby's of the world unite!
it seems that the provincial gives carte blanche to the cdpq infra to do what it wants, and the artm is imposed on things like the drawdown clause, the "sale" of land in the deux-montagne line as well as its closure much longer than expected.
if you need training to know not to pepper spray a man who is not resisting, you are not intellectually fit enough to have a job at all
we don't need police with better training. we need to stop wasting so much money on police and put some of that funding into community support and mental health support. including crisis teams equipped to handle these cases. police shouldn't be anywhere near people in mental health crises.
[deleted]
can we just have social workers working in tandem with the police to answer to these calls.
it will not solve everything, but a lot of these situations could turn out way better than they do at the moment... also, the workers might be able to help some people on the streets too.
if you have a family or friend in mental health crisis, never call the police. this is what happens or even worse like alain magloire story.
simple: pass a law wherein cops abusing their power get subjected to the same thing they inflicted on their victims. they’ll think real hard before abusing their power.
i don’t get it, no one needs to train me not to attack someone who is tied up. what am i missing?
[well this blew up, 47k upvote on r/publicfreakout](
takes a special kind of denial to be a cop, the kind that denies humanity.
more non-action responses as always
dude should consider himself lucky not to be dead.
the way that cop jumped infront of him with the pepper spray, definitely looking for a reaction to escalate further
just because he's standing there does not mean he is not resisting.
that being said, i do wonder whether the officers escalated the situation to this point by being agressive and insulting or if they genuinely tried to nicely and calmly to talk him down and he just refused no matter what they tried. sometimes people just can't be talked down.
at some point, if they have reason to think that the guy is a danger to himself or to others, they have to restrain him one way or the other.
another way to look at it, as crazy as it might seem, is that they might have just saved someone's life by doing this. maybe even his.
but in the end, i wonder if someone not wearing a uniform, non threatening and trained in deescalating people in mental crisis could've talked him down.
yawn.
resisting man ultimately taken into custody.  non-story if not deemed to be aggressive *by his friend, who called the cops on him.*
oh, but social workers would have handled it better.
"can you please calm down, sir?"
"no."
"okay cops, i tried.  take him."
we only know about these stories because of video evidence. imagine how often this stuff happens off-camera.
i mean, police forces are known for rejecting high iq candidates, the whole system kinda depends on it. can't have your cogs begin to question why the gear is spinning.
139 upvotes for a lie, guy was resisting. says so in the article
actually we need both as police are most often the ones called to handle such cases.
ideally, the police force would be separated into social intervention units and criminal units.
[deleted]
almost every police tech student i knew at abbot was an asshole. they're drawn to the job.
the thief is either on some drug or suffers from some mental illness or both. pass by the area from time to time, maybe you will see them but expect to be dealing with someone out of their mind and no sense of time.
oh man, relevant story.
i had a bicycle (well, 3) stolen out of my garage last spring. 1 was a super generic kid's mtb from walmart that you see everywhere, but the 2 others were rather unique, or so i thought!!!
maybe a month ago, i see some guy riding my bicycle going up atwater. i stop him, angrily demand where the fuck he got his bike from, he says it sat for years at his neighbors' blah blah blah. until i take a better look and holy shit it's the same model as my bike but not mine.
i felt like such a moron. i obviously apologized to the dude, but geez what are the odds.
i've never ever seen any my stolen bicycle anywhere again, and they were pretty distinctive.
honestly, if the thief is a meth head offer him 20$ in exchange of the safe return.
what a beautiful bike! best of luck
if you ever find the bike in the future, id strongly recommend sticking an airtag or a smarttag to the bottom of the seat or something so that in the future it is traceable. 
best of luck in your search!
clearly the person that took the bike really believes it was theirs, otherwise they wouldn't have bothered with the signs and with calling you by phone. perhaps such vintage bikes could resemble each other quite closely after so many years? i hope you resolve this weird situation.
a bike like this is not as rare as you think -- it could be a case of "mistaken identity", where the guy who took it genuinely believes it's his.
is it by any chance an older francophone man going by the name of benoit, kind of rotund and balding? if so, yeah he stole your bike.
honestly, and i know it's not nice, but your best chance of getting it back is to carry a spare lock with you in case you see the bike somewhere, and do what he did -- lock it up with your lock and cut his lock, steal it back.
if you look around bike coops and such, they sometimes have vintage fixer-uppers. if it's the style your partner is after, and not the very specific individual bike, you could find an inexpensive replacement that way.
good luck!
how much this bike worth? i’m talking about monetary not sentimental.
i'm sorry for the pain to you and your partner. it is indeed a beautiful and distinctive bike, i can well imagine how shitty this feels, and i will keep my eyes open for it on the bike paths.
and how did you come in possession of the bike? it’s not anywhere in the post and i wonder if you might have bought a stolen bike. just a question because it’s not unheard of…
we open our eyes. a bicycle of the same does not go unnoticed. if the thief's [siborium is as * confused * as you say, he might keep it “precious” in his apartment or garage. but otherwise, i believe the story is very clear and well documented. good idea to appeal to the community on top of that.
good luck!
that's a shame. i am sorry. but look for another bike. shopping is fun. i don't mean to be an ass by that comment. upvote for the bilingual post.
meth is a hell of a drug...
maybe they had the sign ready to go as a cover, so that any witnesses would just say "oh well wtv i guess" and move on
so are we cracking down on bike thief or are we just driving cars till we die.
i want to ride my bike to work. but the damn thing almost got stolen with the quick release.
what is the make and model of that bike? i check cl and kijiji daily, so i'll keep an eye out.
i like how no one mentions asking the police for additional help. when i got mine stolen outside my house, i've rarely seen such apathy in someone eyes and tone than at the police station when i told them about my stolen (unmarked) bicycle.
some cities have active campaigns about marking bikes and actively documenting them on project529 to help retrieval efforts. i'm half surprised a cycling friendly city like montréal doesn't implement that.
tl;dr buy a shitty used bike for 150$ and put reflective hello kitty stickers on it so no one wants to steal it. there's no point in buying something nice here, especially for commuting on pot-hole ridden roads.
if you can get a hold of the guy and have receipts from c&l of the new parts (that makes it unique) maybe there's a chance you could convince him/involve the police?
i saw your sign near la fontaine. good luck!
had a similar thing with a homless man who just walked off with my dog, while i was paying inside. 
luckily my friend found them in an ally.
the man got frusteated, shouting the dog was his and we had stole him ect. we asked what the dogs name was he said "bolo". 
i told him call the dog, my dog ignored him, i called "nala" and she strained on the leash to come to me. we just went see its not your dog. 
he droped the leash and went to sit in a box. i really love my dog so was happy to get her back, though part of me thought she probably would of brought a lot of happiness to this lost soul.
stop spreading lies and using photoshop trickery ...you know the bike is mine.
the political issue aside, as someone with a massive hard on for trains and public transit, i really wish they would block highways instead of via rail. our train network in canada needs some love. :(
what is the relationship between the canadian pacific railway on the one hand and the rcmp, coastal gaslink and the wet'suet'en on the other?
here we go again
at this distance, all it's going to do is piss off the people here for absolutely nothing. let them take the plane and go and demonstrate where it counts ... not here.
petit heads up:
- the elected leaders were elected by 55 people out of a community of 3000
- their jurisdiction is applicable on the reserve only therefore not on the unceded ancestral territory
-from a legal point of view, canada is in the wrong according to the un
for those who want to analyze this from a purely legal point of view and have a headache:
good for those who are not going to read the article. it is demonstrators who blocked a cp lane in the thousand end in montreal. so at first sight they are not natives and therefore there is no reason to launch into a debate.
are you at least members of the first nations blocking the tracks?
you know what will make people care more about these causes? increasing the price of their groceries, and making shortages worse…
-protesters, probably
i am a big fan of amtrak.. took the train from chicago to west cost many times..
if i can say few words....
via rail does not need some love... it needs realistic price for travellers...
they did not block via rail in any way.
our train network brought about death and destruction for the western nations, seems fitting they block it.
from what i understand, they block the paths because
• it disturbs / makes people talk but it remains a peaceful action
• it is at the same time a symbolic gesture, as the railways are important in the history of canada and have aiding / accelerating the process of land theft by the british crown / canada as well as colonization
here we go again… the government of canada sending in armed mercenaries to impose colonialist pipelines through unceded first nations territory, arresting journalists, violating constitutional rights.
there the demonstrators (who are peaceful) were picked up and arrested by the rcmp, who were armed. it wouldn't make sense to go there.
also, just for your information, when they (the wet'suwet'en nation) say the pipeline is in unceded territory, they are 100% right. most of the territory of canada was ceded, by the signing of numbered treaties (which were signed in a vrm sketch and not legit. their legitimacy is therefore questionable), with the exception of the majority quebec and bc. the pipeline is on land that has never legally been ceded or purchased by the british crown, so does not really belong to the government of canada.
thank you for the link! i have a lot of trouble understanding what is happening especially at the level of the law in relation to an unceded territory
> the elected leaders were elected by 55 people out of a community of 3000
if you're referring to [this election] ( your portrayal of the situation is so biased how hard it is to believe in your good faith.
the leader of the * wetʼsuwetʼen first nation * (one of the two wetʼsuwetʼen bands associated with the * carrier sekani tribal council *) was elected with 55 votes ** ahead of her two rivals. 107 people voted out of 183 eligible voters.
there was a call for solidarity action.
no that’s just how you piss more people off
with respect my fellow train comrade, i don't think the issue is ticket prices. the issue is that our train network is massively underfunded and underdeveloped. i'd pay extra money if it meant having reliable and frequent high speed rail between quebec city, montreal and toronto. 
high frequency rail is coming to the windsor corridor at least. it'll give us a network worthy of the 1990s. which is an improvement.
so you have a week waste getting across the country?
yassss
total domination if we look at the stats.
i might be out of the loop on this but when did we stop calling them the montreal impact?
go cs! oops, cf!
i had heard on the radio ik a few months ago that the club was ripping it off. was it true?
woohoo champions of nothing
immensely thought out! mmh wondering if this comment will hit the generateor as well...
oh boy... huh, 14 janvier 2021... and its been drama over drama over drama since then...
geez alright. also just looked it up and it's not club de football as i thought it was. it's club de foot. please correct me if i'm wrong but that sounds not only incorrect but stupid.
you're not wrong
the less car and the most public transport possible! we won't give a damn about visual or noise pollution when we have to move to camps because of climate change.
we need the rem de l'est to stimulate residential construction and partially solve the current accessibility problem. i really hope that we will find a solution where everyone is happy, and i think these examples point it in the right direction.
aerial = not beautiful
underground = too expensive
isn't the best solution to go at ground level on rue sherbrooke? the cheapest solution, easily accessible, and we reduce the space of the car at the same time!
it is not really the same constraints that said. in the hague, as soon as you go underground, you need to have something to pump.
one cool thing about netkous that they don't talk about too much in the article is that the noise is surprisingly broken, as if it is projecting less far away.
just no, it's not really more beautiful, the visual and sound nuisance will remain the same, on the ground or nothing ...
its also completly absurd when people complain about visual/noise polution when talking about anything compared to a car. like just walk outside into any major street in montreal and actually listen. cars are really, really loud. and car infrastrucure, like parking lots and wide roads, are some of the most depressing looking places in the world.
exactly.  it's amazing how there's rarely this extended handwringing over ubiquitous car infrastructure.  it's everywhere, it's ugly, it pollutes, and it makes tons of noise, yet somehow new public transit infrastructure needs to be 100% perfect.  they need to put up noise barriers on the elevated route and get on with it...
imagine living on fucking sherbrooke in downtown montreal and suddenly you say to yourself "oh my god, an aerial train is the definitive element that will create noise and visual pollution" ...
you have to be completely stupid or have a doctorate in cognitive dissonance at this point
if the rem is much the same as the vancouver sky train, there will be no noise pollution. i think my vitamix makes more noise than the sky train.
yes, and the alternative, the underground metro, will never be built. the pink line today would cost more than double the current full rem. the metro is fine, but we will never have the 4-5 new lines that we need if each line costs 15-20 billion.
sustainable development is also the social side. we don't need to sacrifice urban planning to deal with climate change.
i am for the rem, but not in the air downtown
[removed]
level crossings are incompatible with the rem. a driverless train must be completely separated from traffic.
also, the more that a train interacts with the tanks, the more likely the train has to get stuck for one reason or another. at rush hour when there will be trains every 2 minutes, it is sure that there will be problems.
in fact as the article and one that appeared on the copenhagen train mentions, the worst sections of these trains would be when they are at street level and they block long segment with individual barriers. isolate the tracks with a wall. it is much better when it is high enough to allow traffic below.
in an ideal world we could bury everything super hollow for cheap except that we do not live in an imaginary world so ... aerial it is
the most logical solution would be to put it underground in sherbrooke. the article also mentions it, an aerial route can be done correctly on a fairly wide street with already commercial zoning.
what the caisse proposes is to make it on sherbrooke, which is almost 2x less wide than in the example, and to pass it through residential areas of medium density - duplex / triplex and block of apartments. 3-5 floors. the caisse wants the money that goes through the green line by joining hb without wanting a route that makes sense for the neighborhood.
and the elevated 40 which passes all over montreal, is that right for example? with 24 hour traffic on it, it's super relaxing.
> on the ground or nothing ...
train on the ground + distribution of jetpacks to all montrealers to cross the rail safely, or nothing ...
/s
isn’t it supposed to be virtually silent?
what did you smoke? a train at ground level is the worst of both worlds.
in the path for both pedestrians and cars.
no more beautiful.
also noisy.
i guess a little cheaper but ... just no
unless you want a tram, no way a train makes sense street level ...
yeah i don’t see how the rem would be worse than freakin’ notre-dame est
the early pandemic response of this hospital was very very effective. consequently they were able to keep this horrible disease outside of their facilities.
i thought the chinese hospital was closed?
we have a chinese hospital? i wasn't aware.
neat!
if only china itself could have kept it away..
it has become a housing center for the elderly - however, the institution has decided to keep the same name of the 'hospital' for historical reasons.
second sentence of the article:
> a resident at the montreal chinese hospital, a long-term care home located near chinatown 
hell it's even in the sub-heading. not a hospital, just a very divisively named long-term care home that caters exclusively to asians and is near chinatown.
they did. they're the ones who implemented an actual full lockdown early on and are basically back to normal now.
agreed
> just a very divisively named long-term care home that caters exclusively to asians and is near chinatown.
the idea is that you have chsld services in cantonese and mandarin. there are similar places with services in greek, italian, hungarian, yiddish, etc.
>just a very divisively named long-term care home that caters exclusively to asians and is near chinatown.
it appears that way to people ignorant to its history. might also be due to one's own racism.
after arresting journalists and healthcare workers trying to spread the word. this was in november 2019 btw. if they had let the word out and closed their international flights at the time, it could have been prevented.
full lockdowns only after letting it leak worldwide sure.
by barricading people in their homes, would you have preferred that?
oof, that's one way to look at it.  another is that they tried to cover it up initially, let it plant seeds across the world, then went full lockdown and refused to accurately and transparantly report on covid cases or the source of the disease to save face.
except, they aren't.
edit: don't know why i'm getting downvotes, but china is far from being back to normal as they want to achieve 0 covid cases before easing their measures.
but hey get downvoted for telling the truth.. it’s clear where the virus originated.
no objection to that, but if you call your chsld montreal chinese hospital when we have things like montreal children's hospital and montreal jewish hospital, it is because you are clearly trying to muddy the waters and mislead people. and that's without saying it's not a hospital.
i like your username and the truths you speak.
why are you being downvoted this sub is crazy.
initially, it was a real hospital and then it became a chsld: 
we were there this weekend and you have to wear the mask even if it's outside. it is forbidden to circulate there with drinks or while eating. and it may be my cynical aspect but i had the impression that it was essentially made in china crap ... joy
i went there and had an experience of the opposite.
if the mask is mandatory, then not many people followed this rule. no one was checking either. i didn't notice the signs, but that doesn't mean it's not true.
the world goes around with wine / hot chocolate, sandwiches, etc.
several small craft shops in quebec present their products.
just lack of snow, but i found it good! it didn't look like having had a christmas market for 3-4 years. my 7 year old daughter loved it too.
plot twist: go to the mini christmas market and not to the big christmas market.
honestly they can speak well of all the special units that work 8-5. it takes a police presence in the city center at night and a mobile unit in a central point to respond quickly.
it's like the domestic violence ads on the radio. it's cool, but i don't think the person who is going to hit this woman in a rage is going to stop and say "it's true they told me not to do it on the radio"
they are full of appearances but few actions have the current impact.
> it's like the announcements of domestic violence on the radio
i don't think those are for the benefit of abusers. maybe it wakes a victim up and makes them realize their situation isn't ok or lets people around them find signs of the problem.
it also primes people to change their attitudes. the dominant attitude toward domestic violence used to be "it's none of our business what happens in someone else's home," and that's still sadly common enough in some circles. people tend to shift their attitudes towards what they perceive to be socially acceptable, and increasing the intensity of our response as a community to domestic violence occurring within it *will* shape social attitudes to follow. especially in younger people.
i am always explaining to people how beautiful montreal is. but since we are between us ... is it only me who finds it a bit ugly as a tower?
a nice fluff piece from quebecor which has a negative value on this sub.
i work at pvm and love it.
since they explained to me that the cross shape of the building was built to allow more windows seen from the inside, i find it not crazy pentoute!
i understand this point of view, but honestly i don't hate it at all. for example, i consider it to have aged much better than the [bmo tower in toronto] ( which opened almost 10 years later.
> is it just me who thinks it's a bit ugly as a tower?
yes
the pvm is a cultural symbol of the 60s. it may be an architectural style that is no longer in fashion, but it's not been there for 10 years anyway. it was the symbol of montreal during the expos, the olympics and all the major political problems we had during the quiet revolution. she deserves that place in the montreal landscape.
i think everything in montreal is beautiful compared to the marriott.
the marriott is quirky as a tower. never seen anything like it.
are we talking about the big textured concrete penis with a sheet metal cylinder on top? it's pretty common cheap soviet brutalism.
maybe i shouldn't argue too much about mtl's skyscrapers, i cover all skyscrapers lol. there are just 2 things that i don't like: skyscrapers above 205m in height and all the creaks of generic condos that are being built everywhere. we're going to have the area in toronto if they continue with these shitty skyscrapers there, there's absolutely no creativity in their architecture.
the polygraph is pseudo-science.
100%. coupled with other interrogation methods, it can exert pressure and lead to answers, but alone it gives no concrete results
yes, everyone knows that ... but if you read the article there is a good chance this man is innocent.
he has already spent over 29 years in prison for a dirty job from the crown. the crown even hid, or at least forgot, evidence that could have exonerated this man.
my 3 favorites in this list:
\ -the fluke mural in lasalle (what a look!)
\ -that of maliciouz in rosemont (she does an exceptional job, i have seen several of her works in st-michel and elsewhere, her style stands out so much !!!)
\ -and that of ankh one in hochelga-maisonneuve ... i did not know that it was dedicated to space for life. i now understand the composition of the mural ...
fluke always makes great murals. i love his style.
woow i love it 😍
i no longer recognize the montreal i grew up in, the one where criminal bikers detonated bombs in residential neighborhoods and the mafia eliminated its opponents in broad daylight.
i don't really understand these articles, i used to hear gunshots all the time where i used to live in lasalle and it was never reported, why are gunshots being reported in the news now?
either way, there are shootings all the time now !!
ghetto
it's in montreal-north, not ahuntsic. talk about quality journalism ...
people got angry when innocent people were killed.
when a mobster gets killed on his front steps or a biker in his garage, everyone doesn't care.
ah, the good old days.
😂😂😂
because it suits the media narrative.
political issue.
sensationalism of the media.
cops want more budget for cops
probably because there seems to be an actual turf war thing going on, and tv5 tends to always report those things, more so than english media (my guess)
saturday at 3pm though. isn't it more exceptional?
fear has been a tool of government since the start of the pandemic. im the eyes of all mighty legault, it worked *very* well. he learned, and adapts the strategy.
ahuntsic a ghetto? you really shouldn't know the neighborhood.
every ghetto every city! - lauryn hill
the intersection of sackville and port-royal streets is well located in the ahuntsic-cartierville district.
[source: an official map] (
in your defense, it would be understandable that an error be made in indicating that it is rather the st-michel district, because this intersection is directly on the boundary between the two districts.
we could have spoken of st-michel and / or ahuntsic-cartierville, but not of montreal-north.
edith: a haughty comment withdrawn.
it is in sault-au-récollet which is in ahuntsic. you're wrong.
never forget the youngster who died from the explosion of the hells bunker in hochelaga.
i lived on dorion, (the bunker was on the next street, given the name) just opposite. the explosion knocked down bricks from the building where my father was staying
it was a lot more in public than we remember
kind of a spaceships vibe!
beautiful!
whoa, that's a great shot indeed. 
quite the challenge for sure. 
and had to stay up pretty much all night, it was cloudy that night.
stunning shot! edmond chung is legit 👌

i’m all for this, although the stm and the cities involved need to make sure that: 1. buses to and from the station are frequent enough that drivers can choose to take the bus without consequences. 2. have a cycling infrastructure that will allow the majority of people get to and from the stations without feeling like they are putting their life in danger. 3. tod, density is key to making these stations lovely and viable.
honestly i'm 100% for this plan. i understand that it may turn off some customers, but we have to break up with this notion that it's a good idea to use this potentially super productive land for free parking. 
i grew up in pierrefonds and the train station was full of cars that would just sit there all day being subsidized by the transit agencies. i couldn't help but wonder if society could use that land in a way that would benefit the users and the surrounding area. hopefully they eventually make it a majority paid at some point, or start converting free parking to daily necessities like small grocery stores, daycares, and/or housing to make transit an easier transition.
nice. they shouldn’t even have parking in the first place, it should be five over ones. 
grocery stores and housing are way more valuable uses of land than asphalt.
i'm betting this will backfire. given the choice between taking a crowded bus to an rem station and taking that downtown, or simply driving downtown, most people will choose the latter.
the bus service in the west island is abysmal as of right now, so unless the service will be drastically improved in terms of comfort, frequency, speed, and reach, people will just stick with their cars.
granted that this is intended to force regular users to take bus to rem rather than car, but it already does not make financial sense to use public transit for occasional non rush hour users with 2 or more people in a car.  it’s cheaper and more convenient to pay for parking at destination rather than take public transit, especially with additional parking charges up front making the value prop to take public transit even worse.
i no longer have the impression that people will take the tank to montreal as long as they pay for the parking anyway. but it will certainly convert several to the bus too for sure.
it seems that when it comes to transports, there is always a relevant r/notjustbikes video :
i'm for this, except i've lived in a city that tried implementing this sort of thing for their lrt at the station i used, and it backfired (calgary). when they made parking free again, the lot filled up again. though i think they kept the spots closest to the pedestrian overpass leading to the station as paid spots (iirc, the lot would be nearly filled up well before 7am)
major difference is this: this change was implemented on a station that had been opened for almost 6 or so years. perhaps implementing a paid parking system from the get-go when the new stations open may have a different result?
meh i couldn't care less. we live in the city and the rem for me will be to go to the airport and downtown. everything else is by car. sucks for the 'burbs people tho.
think the main parking needs will be in the west island. tbh, i'd just provide all the parking for free around the stations in those areas with the goal of getting some of these people to use public transits when the west is known to drive everywhere 99% of the time.
i think no one red the article: between 20% to 30% of the brossard or deux montagnes…
[deleted]
none of this exists.  the stations open next year.
that’s crap. if you want to encourage people in the suburbs to take the train, you need free parking and easy access. 
the current plans for the west island are going to ensure the lack of success of the rem: no parking, no access other than bikes and buses. people will continue to take their cars to get to work because they need the car to drop off their kids at daycare/school and get to their destination.
yup. preach it sister. and ai would be proper to study this.
i’m mostly in favour, i just wish they did more to encourage us to not drive to the station. as someone who used to have late-ish shifts (arriving at panama around 10/11 pm), the rtl buses were so rare that it made sense to park there. it was either drive home from panama or wait 45 mins for the next local bus to come by.
for what it’s worth, there have been tons of small businesses and restaurants right next to that parking lot for years. in general, they don’t do so well. the loblaws shut down in 2015, and is now a vaccination centre, and the mini mall was razed for the construction of the rem station, although that felt like it was just a halloween pop-up shop and empty units near the end.
then you'll have less usage of the actual trains, and aggravating all nearby residents by on street parking, defeating the original purpose of trains.
agreed. free parking is not a public good, it's a subsidy.
it just doesn't work.  the suburbs are already built and are spread out by design.  the rem is intended to reach these suburbs and get their cars off of downtown streets and it it means having people park in a parking lot then it is by far the lesser of two evils.  the alternative to not parking at the rem for most users will be to not use it because the transit services to reach certain rem stations will be inadequate.
no parking lots = traffic downtown and an underused rem.
let them be pay parking lots.  it will be a money generator for a system that will likely lose money (like the rest of quebec transit systems)
i agree and i would assume it's in their plans. going from thousands of spots to zero probably would piss off a lot of people, so they probably (based on what i'm getting from their comments in this article) the plan to do the following:
1) partially paid
2) fully paid
3) fully paid with some spots converted for businesses
4) all spots converted to businesses and housing.
it's very much in their economic interest, but even though they're a "private" company, they still need to play the the political game. 
better late than never!
i don't know anything about them except that they are near my home, but artisans of azure seems like an option !: 
on the plaza st hubert between bellechasse and beaubien there is a medieval shop. on the other hand i do not know if they make rentals.
tried with them-others 
they make armor for the life-size role-playing game, like the duchy of bicolline.
there is also zardwin on the south shore of montreal: 
call me: +1 (514) 432-2090
i am 0 connoisseur but i was going to say the same thing. it doesn't look any worse when i walk past.
my friend works there and it is of very good quality.

that’s the number for bain coloniale ain’t it.
> after all, the mayoress earns 3.5 times the average salary in quebec, not 165 times, like some bosses of companies listed on the stock exchange with the same number of employees.
>...
> not paying our elected officials adequately risks costing more in the end. some elected officials, to compensate, could be tempted by brown envelopes. or, “round up” certain municipal bylaws so as not to scratch businesses that are likely to hire them after they have been in politics.
ceos must be the least corrupt people with the highest moral values out there.
then at the other end of the spectrum, when you look at the offers on québec-municipal / umq site, there are tons of villages and small towns with elected officials and part-time officials who make less than $ 50 000 / year. how are these places going to recruit people who know how it works? i had applied to a municipal job 2 hours away from home, after the interview they wanted me but were not able to offer 60k / year for a dual management position in the urban planning and environment area !!
it is sure that you come together with juniors and / or retirees in conditions like these ...
mayors are rarely the highest paid municipal employees. they’re paid like a white collar middle manager or mid level professional for the city. compared to those salaries, an elected official makes a pittance a for the responsibility they have.
> some elected officials, to compensate, could be tempted by brown envelopes.
this argument, which is often brought up for judges, deputies, etc., i find it so contrary to reality. on the contrary, the more expensive it is paid, the more we attract people who want the job to make money, to the detriment of a desire for public service, and who will be susceptible to corruption.
> let yourself be tempted by brown envelopes
whether they charge 80k or 140k, envelopes will always be welcome.
you know the reason the police and judges pay dearly is to eliminate corruption. if you don't believe me go take a ride where they are poorly paid.
ouch.
$ 60k a year is wickedly rough for a college graduate.
cost of living eg lower but it is still very average, especially since it does not rise quickly the wages in the public.
what kind of mid-level professional gets such salary? i'm ready to jump ships.
> if you don't believe me go for a ride where they are poorly paid.
i would tell you, if you believe it, take a walk where they get paid ...
i make $ 31 an hour with a 5-day course to work in support on a rope (i abseil down). right now i'm on vacation but when i go back to vancouver i'll ask my boss for 35 and i'll get it. i don't work 2000 hours a year because i'm not tempted so i won't make 60,000, but on a pro-rata basis i do more with the times when i get paid overtime on time and a half.
off the top of my head: engineers, public relations coordinator, it
for example?
engineers don't make alot of money anymore though...
go ask a resident of hochelaga where the crackhouses are and ask yourself why the police let them operate with impunity when everyone knows where they are.
they can make the $150-175k that a mayor would make rather easily at the city.
it's weird, don't forget these articles:

... to the detriment of just about everything else.
because you'll notice - governments don't invest more in research.
mathematics departments are shrinking visibly, we are losing teachers left and right. also in the natural sciences (except in sciences applied to health). in the humanities - better not to talk about it.

fortunately, because intelligence itself has definitely not undergone any growth.

they generally make the mistake of counting "talent" in terms of number of doctorates and "advances" in number of papers published. while completely useless doctorates there are shovelfuls and the same goes for papers; there are tens of thousands of papers published every year in ai and maybe a few dozen have an impact.
well, i guess i won't be specializing in ai.
you have to train the ai to learn, we only pitch cash to him to value and end up selling to americans. it's big bullshit, just like 95% of "fintech". but hey it looks good on paper.
you have to see the arrogance of the gentleman to send one of his students for an interview to say that he is the "most important person in ai" (which is ridiculously false).
wow seriously you have no idea what you're talking about. what is the point of the subsidies that go to mila you think? i invite you to inform yourself a little before making accusations like that. the guy could have gone to the us and worked for one of the top companies and surely had more money than these said grants for himself. rather, he chose to promote education and found the mila. in fact his brother works for google and he too could have done the same, that says a lot about the person.
are you referring to the mila covid app? or something else?

get this in mind, humans have been playing this game for 4000 years and there have been hundreds of thousands of players. yet in less than 3 days only, the ai to surpass any human and to develop tactics crude impossible. in 3 days, this machine has made more than xxx million humans in 4000 years.

ok, but that's the nature of science, you don't know what you don't know. it's very difficult to know in advance which paper will have an impact, sometimes it takes 2, 5, 10 years. when the paper on the gans was written, we found it quite funny and no one at udem would have dared to imagine that it would explode like that 4-5 years later (or that it was going to be used eg in pharmaceuticals) .

again, we are talking about a doctorate in real science, not a doctorate in vacation science / bachelor of art.
i work in ai, there is a lot of good, real work. and it pays really well. but it takes ai + another area of expertise to apply it. the mistake is the companies who hire a troll of graduates with their doctorate in ai and think they can make products with it. you can't fix, really fix, a problem in an area that you don't understand, no matter what tool.

i agree! having a progressive municipal government is a nice contrast to our provincial overlords.
it's a taxpayer-funded pr campaign/hobby.
i feel like everyone was “progressive” but in their own ways, with some being a worse “progressive” than others. i think this was the best outcome and honestly, she didn’t have much of a chance when legit the entire city shut down due to the pandemic.
so... you wanted to publically ask a question, so your could answer it to yourself?
tbf it wasn't actually a question. more like an fyi
i read the answer and summarized it. there's a heading that's literally "a public relations entity" in the links op submitted.
column from a high school teacher: i had a lot of fun discussing the story of the $ 13.50 pig's foot with the kids in high school 5. they're exactly about the time to be minimum wage workers but with the labor shortage, they can take advantage of it and do a little more. they work a lot in grocery stores as a clerk or cashier / cashier and i very much hope that they will be able to take advantage of the fact that they have the big end of the stick for once.
chronic renovations, the owner made his last offer. we really tried to reason with him. he's giving us 14 months rent to leave. chu burnt out, tired, i don't have a crumb of energy to put in to fight against a capitalist devoid of empathy. i must get out of here as hell.

i'm super happy, i won a pair of tickets to chom to see the damn truth tonight !! it's been more than a year and a half since i saw a rock show, i bounce off the walls! i'm really looking forward!!
otherwise, i started to do replacements for the school daycare service in addition to my job as a supervisor. i have bands cooler than others, but it's still fun, then it allows me to carry out my diabolical plan: to corrupt the youth with rock'n'roll. so when i watch a band, i always discreetly play rock on my phone, in the hope that it fits them subliminally!
have a nice weekend everyone!
meetings with parents this week. i only have a few left! it's generally going well and i'm lucky to have parents who don't blame me (yet) for the disastrous boxes. otherwise, i had to wash the twink in a hurry this morning, the shaving had worked really well for the poo in the hair, but now the hair is growing back. it's no fun washing the bottom of a recalcitrant twink.
the metro needs to rethink it's prices for the post-covid era. pre-covid i left my car at home and just used a monthly pass; driving to work every day vs 80$ a month was a no-brainer.
now though, i work hybrid. i spend about 5 days a month in the office, and usually spread out not back to back. 6$ a day for metro vs driving, suddenly my car looks like a better option. especially that my car is clean, air conditioned, and doesn't have people begging for money in it. 
the stm no more needs to turn a profit than the hospital system; why not have a pass valid for 10-12 hours and a maximum of 4 swipes within that time, for 3 or 4 dollars? that would make me leave my car at home, that's for sure.
just got the schedule for our retour en presentiel and i’m losing my mind. 
i’m sitting in the office today, alone and shivering because it’s so cold in here and doing basically nothing because i wrapped up my work for the week yesterday, but i still am mandated to show my face in the office for two days a week. 
i’m going into overdrive on applying to places that will allow remote work because my mental health simply cannot take being confined to a cold office building in the middle of winter when the sun goes down at 4. i don’t know how i did it before but i can’t go back.
> i set my status to do not disturb to have the focus i need to set priority-one tasks against critical systems
> i get up to go to the toilet
> i come back to 12+ direct-messages from lots of sales team members doing aaaaaaaaaa help plz chus blocked please do asap omg omg this is urgent
another typical friday ...
friday is ravioli.
i am down to 25 exchange emails that started 1.5 months ago with the city permit officer for my basement excavation which is due to start on monday. i have plans of engineer, architect, i do not touch anything that must go through the ccu and he still finds a way to delay the delivery of the permit with requests he does not need to then retract and say that he "continues to evaluate". frustrating.
first sewing class this week! in the end, the experience was a little sad: there was a lot for one teacher, the pace was super fast so the teacher spends a lot of time with the most talented so they don't find it boring and the rest of the gang well ... we in tears. at least now i would know how to be pocket-friendly in the comfort of my apartment.
i know it's not fancy to say, especially this year, but i can't wait for the black friday sales. i really need a new winter coat - in case winter comes.
podcast of the moment: [the story will tell us] ( by laurent turcot [fr]
this podcast uses history and sometimes pop culture to demonstrate connections to our lives today. laurent turcot is a historian specializing in world war ii, but he often makes the links with news. he presents the story in a still accessible way because often i find it very dry as a subject to listen to. it's really interesting how society repeats the same mistakes. it was a podcast recommended to me by someone on this subreddit so thank you! :) i recommend it for people also learning french!
any montreal musicians want to jam this today/weekend? any skill level welcome!
while writing content for a training course that i will be giving in the coming weeks, i made a mistake and put code 14 instead of code 18 (see definition of the urban dictionary).
luckily, the contact person, who reviews my documents, at the client has a good sense of humor.
i just started a job that pay 10k more than my other job.
i'm supposed to do 20% work from home 80% à job.
my old job never disconnected from my wifi since i started new job. how do i know: le pare feu block l'accès wifi de mon nouveau téléphone nokia and several sites like fetlife.com are banned sur mon wifi perso. lol
so i cant do 20% of my work because emploi a might commit unintentionally corporate espionage sur emploi b. before you asked, i called it, ancien gestionnaire etc.
rofl
to make it even better hr is sooo behind on the paperwork at the new job i have almost access to fuck all. lolllllll
first day at work? i cleaned a keyboard for like an obscene amount of money. ma nouvelle boss était comme "yo j'ai mis un rush"....
i'm like on vacation without being on vacation and it is glorious. it's nice cause i've been busting my ass for the past 15 years. 
hey job a et b: might want to look into this guys cause you're wasting a lot of time on money. j'espères que qqn de ti voient mon post. jfc lolll
you do it right! 🤟
oh fuck me. this is beautiful.
the fact that you are raising our children brings me great peace.
rile the youth up and send them out in the world.
rebel.
it's time le monde des finances puts their money where their mouth is. better salaries and wages for all crisse.
onward câlisse!
you are obviously not an economics teacher and you do not seem to understand the repercussions of what you have just done. it would be good if the teacher that you are to leave his personal opinions aside and teach in a pedagogical way concepts related to subjects that he masters.
prepare your speech on the cycles of the recession right away, it will be a nice way to get you back.
it's pocket-sized to say, but sometimes our sanity is more important than not letting go. make the best decision for you :)
14 months rent is a good deal, take it.
if he's ready to offer you 14 months rent, make him a counter offer for 24 months rent. even if it means leaving, you might as well leave with your head held high.
yes ! the francization teachers at the ministry of immigration love these videos, and adult learners enjoy them too :) :)
i liked the videos i just watched, i will share them with friends who are learning french. thank you
as an austrian who lived in quebec, i have been a subscriber for a few months ✌🏼 i'm fine!
thanks for sharing it. your blonde has a very awesome personality. these videos were recommended to me by youtube a year ago. i've been watching them ever since. they are really good at improving my french, and discovering the peculiarities of quebecois french.
great! i lived in montreal and i miss it, it's nice to see. thanks to your girlfriend
it's really good! i will share this with my learning friends, thank you!
for a moment, i thought it was going to be a video of "geneviève, your quebec french teacher" (aka * maprofdefrançais *), another great resource for people who are learning. congratulations to your girlfriend, it's really great!
yeah i was a subscriber a few months ago and i love his videos! i learn a lot from her, thank you very much from me!
it reminds me of when tv5 was broadcasting a quebec series at the time and there were subtitles lol.
it is adorable.
i understood everything other than arrow, for some reason i did not know la flèche is arrow lol. great video. quick question for op. was this filmed recently? i'm coming to mtl in december, i bet nobody will be wearing t-shirts :d
i find her really nice and calm, i watched several of her videos!
wow, this channel looks like an incredible resource for learning.  please say thanks to your partner for me.
excellent!
very interesting, i think it could help my partner who has trouble with his french. thank you for sharing and bravo to your girlfriend, it's very well done and informative about the city in addition. what a good idea!
for real? :) my girlfriend taught for the ministry, she'll be happy to hear that!
cool! thank you! :)
that's great! thank you! i share your comment with him. :)
haha, that's right. at least here it's not to help french people understand someone who speaks the same language as them ... in any case, i hope! :)
haha! well, there you go, you learned something... which is the very purpose of the video! :)
as for december, i guarantee people will not be in t-shirts by then! this was filmed in late september, so it's already colder now. hope you enjoy your visit!
once i had a fucked up problem with an abusive neighbor. we all parked in the street with stickers so no assigned space. the guy didn't want me to park in front of his house because it was "his place".
he was violent and threatening and everything. me, submissive little kid, i was like ... ok.
once i parked near his house and i had a bad day and he went out to do his number because apparently the day before i had gone to his house. i yelled at him and pissed off.
the next morning i had two flat tires and no proof.
all this to say that an acquaintance, while telling him my story, told me that he knew a shady guy who would be happy to tow his car and take him to his dump to turn his tank into a cube neither seen nor known.
i thought it was a nice idea. well batinsse, i didn't even have time to make a decision when his triplex was burnt down. i saw the guy at tva get interviewed and say he wasn't insured and had lost everything.
damn .... i could never see him again and i told myself that he is lucky to still have his tank !!!
edit : sorry you post was in english. i forgot since we're always switching language over here.
call the city, there's an option to report someone blocking a vehicule. they will ask you if you want to have him towed or only get a ticket.
dam i would be so pissed
since the owner is including a private parking spot, he should be responsible to make sure that you can use this parking spot. you often find building owners who have deals with the towing companies regarding this type of issue. in those case, they put a sign telling the offenders that the towing will be charged to them.
call the spvm: (514) 280-2222 ext. 5
ask them to move the car.
you tow the vehicle, send the invoice to the owner of the vehicle, he'll fuck you up, you chase him.
or you do without results what was mentioned in the thread.
try letting the air out of his tires every night.
if it is on a public road, call stationnement montréal.
if it's on a private parking lot ... urgent i would say it's a civil litigation and you need to get an injunction? good luck.
you can’t have it towed unless it’s a commercial property, even then…
you would have to call the cops and set the precedent. might not leave you in the best standing with someone you live next door to.
my advice is to find out who the vehicle owner is,does he live next door or have some legal premise to park in said location?
in the end you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
if he is your neighbour use reason and decency.
if it doesn’t work you have no choice but to call the cops
for when its going to be freezing outside : egg it, removing it fucks up the paint.
if not freezing just crack them on the wipers so that it makes a mess when they'll activate it.
also pretty great on building windows.
call the police first if they still do it call any towing company but it'll be kn your expense
[deleted]
up to your landlord to control it. if they don’t you have to take them to the tribunal administratif de logement. keep all conversations on record where you’re asking your landlord to resolve it. 
this is obviously not a quick fix.
call 911. i'm not joking. i already face a similar situation and called the police station they told me to just call 911
outside of covid: look up and call your local non-emergency police number for your borough. however, right now they ask to call 911 for these scenarios, so just call them and they'll send someone. 
i had to ask for tow last month in a similar scenario as yours, so this is the current procedure.
call the city. if they can't do anything, leave a note on the truck. if/when they move the truck, invest in a "no parking" sign (canadian tire or home depot) and set it up at your parking spot. 
if all fails, call your landlord. since it's included in the rent, they are responsible for making sure it's available.
let the air out of his tires just enough for him not to notice until he drives away
too real karma
let the air out of his tires. repeat until 'tard gets the message.
it's nothing new, i even wonder why all of a sudden this is the news.
the part of benoit dorais makes me laugh like he thinks he has something, all the zampino family has left is in the name of the children so good luck.
at one point it could be the dunwich borers from fallout 4
it's beautiful to see that!
three years of blasting, piping, jackhammers and grinding under my office window at college. i can't wait for this to end. with the luxury condos they are building nearby (a udem scandal but that's another story) it's really a noisy, dusty area with heavy truck traffic for a few years. i really liked the station wagon when we were telecommuting ...
that being said, i am also very anxious to take the rem.
boulevard tashereau syndrome: parking in front is terribly ugly. must have the window near the sidewalk and the parking lot, if there is, at the back. but once it's already built, it's not easy to change.
ah then a little vegetation on the median that could not hurt.
til there is a ~~strode~~ stroad called maurice duplessis blvd.
i can think of 2 things to do to revitalize the strip... a [diet]( and a name change!
aboot fooking time.
a rev on maurice-duplessis to larcordaire (genre) and a rev on lacordaire to join the rachel trail.
didn't maurice duplessis torture tens of thousands of quebecois children and other innocent people?
how many other places in montreal are named after the grande noirceur?
step 1 is probably dropping minimum parking requirements for businesses on that street.step 2 is making it not a stroad luke other comments have said.
but the people who actually live there would probably think we're bicycle communists who just hate cars and want to bankrupt small businesses.
the guy wants new signs and facades for the aging strip malls and probably a grass median so it looks nicer as they drive by.
first they'd have to demolish the huge refineries... no one wants to live there
i am so glad to see that not just bikes got real popular
this place is a shit hole the people there all look like criminals i was ina store 10m and was afraid they would steal my car
exact. this video explains it very well: [the ugly, dangerous, and inefficient stroads found all over the us & canada] (
it is difficult to change what is existing and functional. but at the end of its life, we can demand that any construction be done, as you say, with the parking lot behind.
unfortunately it can take decades, so you have to start right away. normally, it takes a densification plan with a collective transport plan which will signal to the developers that the place is becoming less centered on the tank.
the (possible) arrival of the rem in taschereau would be a good opportunity to bring the buildings closest to the street and move the parking lots to the back, leaving near the train stations.
shit you beat me too it.
>with its four lanes of traffic, bare cement median and black lamp posts, maurice-duplessis boulevard isn't much to look at, but that doesn't mean it's got nothing to offer, moubarak asserts.
that's the problem right there.  no plants, or places to sit are going to fix it.  you need to reduce it to 2 lanes, reduce the speed limit, and provide services to get to it easily.  remove the strip malls and place the buildings closer to the road.  probably put places to live on top.  essentially you need to overhaul it not to be a strode and create an actual space for people, not cars.
fyi it's *stroad. strode is the past tense of strut (til).
not crazy! i only went there once and it was because i wanted to do a different bike ride through anjou rather than my usual tour of the east island. if there would be a rev, it would tempt me a lot more to go back there, because going through anjou is pretty pocket-friendly.
in addition, the rev on lacordaire could connect to the rev on marseille, which can take you to hochelaga-maisonneuve. after that, it would take another on hochelaga. notre-dame is far too far away and uncomfortable.
yes except that a rev on lacordaire, there is already a lane reserved for buses and carpooling so lacordaire would be almost 1 lane most of the time.
the only way it would be established there is if the citizens around lacordaire and elected officials ask for it and that is not for tomorrow.
langelier would have been a good option but it is too far and he would have to finish joining langelier as far as montreal-north, which has been dragging on for years, so saint-michel would be the most viable option.
yup. it should be renamed "boulevard des orphelins de duplessis".
that's funny, my aunt that was mad black people started to move there says the same thing.
... matante?
the fact that it will take 10-20 years is no reason not to. the dutch did it!
that won't happen: the city of longueuil is putting all its money into just a few areas, and the rest is left to waste away.
places like these are ripe for redevelopment as mixed use. 
we have a housing crisis, so let's build homes near businesses, some condos that aren't tiny, townhomes or whatever. let make housing that makes the area more attractive. businesses and people will benefit.
then, take advantage of the rem coming and facilitate access by building a high quality bus lane with signal priority that can get people to the rem quickly. 4 lanes don't bother me if 2 of them are for transit for most, if not all day.
i hope it's not just "let's put some trees and hope that makes it better". let's make it a destination.
it would probably be much more effective to become your own montreal special doodoo unit and send the offending baggies into the nearest bin yourself but good luck
did you really call and report this instead of picking them up and throwing them away yourself?? it takes like 4 seconds to do, jesus. do you really expect a squadron to come to the exact location just for this. i often pick up trash when i see them it's not that hard (i'm not excusing the person who let the bags there is the first place, they should also learn to not let stuff around)
on the 311 website: "at all times, call 311 if a dangerous situation requires immediate public works intervention, for example: significant accumulation of water in the street, a fallen tree branch or about to fall, debris blocking the public thoroughfare, defective traffic light, pothole that caused a person to fall or damage a vehicle, illegible traffic sign "
hello yes 311? there is a dog poop on the ground quickly!
i mean, a couple of poop bags does not require an emergency response team. when they come for a regularly scheduled clean-up, it will be dealt with. or you could put on a glove and toss them in a trash can.
i take a photo on the montreal app and so far, they’ve picked things up including some asshole’s cat litter bag that was opened by a rodent.
that lady is wrong. she decided on her own that it's not worth it, but i can confirm that they do come pick it up when you call.
jesus christ pick it up yourself.
thats not the role of government.  a bag of poop on the side of the road is hardly a public health concern.  use a bit of hand sanitizer and pick it up…and dog owner’s get your shit together.  i get 60 small bags for a fucking toonie at dollarama
edit.  building a community is more than just paying taxes and expecting shit to be done for you.  people need to collectively put in work
imagine seeing dog shit and calling 311, complaining to them, then going to reddit to complain about not having the poop picked up. what a life
"i was expecting them to send a unit"  😂😂😂😂😂
maybe it was a miscommunication, like they thought you wanted somebody to go after the poop-depositor and not just clean up?
but i also endorse the [montréal – resident services app]( to report less-urgent issues to the city rather than calling 311.
it is the responsibility of the pet owner to pick up the poop and throw it in a garbage can. on the other hand, if they are caught in the act by a police officer, they can be fined.
if someone had to call 311 every time a little bag of poop was found on the sidewalk, they wouldn't end it.
on the other hand, in the city center there are city employees who collect stuff from the floor with a small broom and a trash can. they would probably pick it up. but they are not present in small neighborhoods.
this is what’s wrong with our society. why not do a good deed and pick it up yourself? doesn’t it take way more effort to call the city when you’re literally right there? 
i know it’s not your duty and the dog owner shouldn’t leave it there in the first place but sheesh
what a waste of resources this is. if they do come, they should be fired. the expense to deploy a truck out for this. just crazy. man, you people and your first world problems. just pick it up.
>i called 311 to report that someone had left a couple of doggy bags (full) on the street.
holy fuck, i wish i had no real problems in life too.
as other people said, do it through the app. easier than to talk to a sassy human lol
[deleted]
people are being all snarky here, but it's not a far fetched question to have. op is just asking, "shouldn't all trash get picked up by street cleaners". i will never forget when i went to the city of tours, in france, and i witnessed a city employee whose job was to go around in a scooter and vacuum poop off the street.
street sweepers will clean it once a week or so in the non-winter months. then its left to rot all winter
try the service request app: 
hahaha seriously? i called 311 in quebec 2 times: 1 time a wooden pallet on the laurentienne in the center lane in the evening, super dangerous came very quickly.
2nd time when a non-standard manhole like 2ft x 6ft it sank and fell to the bottom i made a kind of perimeter and i called them, it was fixed the next day.
i never would've thought of calling for a bag of poo, hahaha.
the fact that none of them can see this is a horrible idea is bewildering.
"nobody wants this so you both get it!"
so basically neither city will be attached to this team? what's the point of all this?
montréal is already not that much of a baseball city, so how is having a shared team going make that better?
how about no
why tho?
montreal should instead put its money on the saputo case. l'impacte has a monopoly over soccer in quebec to a point where it is unhealthy. i know a soccer school that has been having problems because they are developing better prospects than l'impacte itself. they are also making it harder for semi-pro teams to get recognition. they are literally a mafia.
saputo mind is somewhere else so it would be better to offer better programs to continue what sports-étude does.
this goes for baseball too since i know it's hard for some kids too to get to any levels.
news at 5. the polish tells us we need more polish. and the saint-laurent is wet!
you need more * beat cops and less * ticket givers. * police officers rarely patrol neighborhoods on foot; they need to talk more with young people, residents and traders.
tip that i liked about tokyo: at every x street corners there is a mini police station with usually a single policeman, often standing outside. he is not there to give tickets, but to help and intervene when needed.
whereas here the town hall treats the police more like tax preceptors.
do not.
what are the images with wwii guns and soviet military weapons ????
tva does sensationalism as usual.
so the way to reduce violence is to have more violent people on the streets.
it makes sense.
instead of asking the mafia to do their jobs the police should focus on illegal guns that “good little guys” sell in the streets.
they did it anyway in my neighborhood at least between 2000 and 2010 +/- for what i remember. they would come to see us at the community garden to make sure it was safe or just to check in on the surroundings and chat. i don't know what happened but at one point it was over. and also: hello tags even on house / garage doors and cars. there is probably no connection between the two, it is just indicative of the evolution of the place. and it's an expensive neighborhood, close to a big video game company whose name we will not say. by that i mean it's not an abandoned place where no one passes.
these are weapons seized in montreal, whether you like it or not.
[
why force illegal guns and traffickers, when you can force guns obtained legally by citizens who actually abide by the law.
in the tva report you even have an image with 2014 written on the police panel they went to look far in titi.
me, either, i do not recognize the montreal of legault where the rent starts at $ 500, $ 600.
legault couldn't find montreal on a map.  montreal doesn't vote for him so he does nothing for the city.
way to wash your hands and take 0 responsibility.
of course he doesn’t recognise montreal. we didn’t vote for him ha!
based on the data here [ i don’t see any red flags at least until 2020 and i doubt anything will be significantly different in 2021.
based on the data from the spvm reports available here: [
the number of yearly homicides since 2000 is as follows: (excludes parts of the metro that spvm doesn’t operate in as the figures from statcan show figures for montreal cma)
2000: 49 
2001: 66 
2002: 47 
2003: 42 
2004: 41 
2005: 35 
2006: 43 
2007: 42 
2008: 29 
2009: 31 
2010: 37 
2011: 35 
2012: 35 
2013: 28 
2014: 28 
2015: 29 
2016: 23 
2017: 24 
2018: 32 
2019: 25 
2020: 25
basically in line with the downtrend in the montreal metro area and pretty much against the idea that homicides have gotten worse. when journalists take a quote from a politician, they should cross check it against what the data says (and yes we can debate whether that data is comprehensive or not) and give a full picture to the readers on the topic.
i checked all the reports in that page and the only one that reports the number of homicides involving a firearm is the one from 2020. i am not sure where the person quoted in the article saying firearm related homicides doubled since 2013 got that number from.
i suspect they were referring to the gun related homicide numbers in all of canada that seem to have jumped from 134 in 2013 to 277 in 2020 based on data available here 
legault so in touch with the population of quebec, no loner recognize the biggest city in the province. gg
va t'en sur ton 3e lien, lego! j'ai tellement hate de ne pas voter pour toi. also ctv needs to learn that the fact that a politician said something is not always news. i won't click the link to drive their metrics, but if this isn't rageclick reporting, i'm not sure what is. do the story on the shooting, but not the "montreal is now a cesspool" hot take that some washed-up old papa who hasn't been to a "less affluent" burrough in 20 years decided to say in public for his voteurs de bainlieu.
[deleted]
ok if i summarize the opinion of several ...
legault is a cryptofacist who says that only to divide montrealers from the rest of quebec and by a dubious shorthand, anglophones and francophones.
z'êtes morons - coderre has built his entire campaign on the fear of street gangs and is undeniably more popular among english speakers. souvenir success:
> “we can have a preventive agenda, but we must have a strong police presence at the same time. i think of dads and moms who are afraid because they don't want to let their children go to the park, ”said mr. coderre, head of ensemble montréal, pleading for a strong fight against crime.
wasn’t he born and raised in sainte anne de bellevue?
maybe he should focus on that town’s municipal politics for a change, we can always use a new mayor
it's dogwhistle. "we no longer recognize montreal", it's just vague enough to wink at xenophobic suburban boomers while not being too much so he can't be picked up.
he is our light quebecois populist republican.
has he ever known montreal?
blaming trudeau for a provincial problem.
god what a stupid fuck.
continues with these hot takes to drum up fear, but ignores the data that is easily accessible given how people put it up in the comments
go shit legault baby boomer in marde
the reason montreal is a safe city is that our tolerance for violence is very low. even that it's pretty much zero tolerance.
that's why people react so strongly. this is why after each event, the media talk about it.
each event of violence is one too many.
this morning (november 18th) knife attack near rue des carrieres and iberville ..... more and more violence.
i lived on the pascal / lapierre corner. yes, there were murders on occasion but to be afraid, not at all. often they are just unconscious young people.
[for everyone looking to gaslighter here, gun crime is on the rise in montreal.] ( -use-of-fire-guns-on-rise / amp /)
“as shootings climb…” 
statistically, aren’t they almost the lowest in the entire decade?
[removed]
good video, horrible timing. should have released it in the summer instead 😅
missed the best in my opinion, iconoglace sur beaubien in petite-patrie
most of shops in the video are pretty bad with ice cream way too sweet. here are better options:
battery or ice
café gelato st-laurent
roberto gastronomy
pierino ice cream parlors
i don't type 12 minutes of videos to find out if boboule in verdun is there. if so good video. if not bullshit.
my dark horse pick: chocolaterie chocomax on decarie. their ice cream and particularly the vanilla  and/or chocolate soft-serve is a cut above anything else i've tried. i think the ice cream is off season right now though!
i loved the bilboquet when i lived in montreal.
missing quite a few good ones; les givres, wild willys, bo-bec, havres aux glaces, choco max. at least they didn't forget kem coba.
my personal favorite is quai des glaces in lachine.
try the butter toffee flavoured ice cream. it’s sooooo good. 
i heard their key lime pie is also very good.
is this one of those videos where 90% of the places are located in the plateau?
i'm glad they included swirl, but the ice cream at noble cafe is meh (the coffee flavour is way too sweet) and they didn't include les givres???
take in that it was snowing in montreal yesterday
i wanna try these, i'm an ice cream guy and have lived in bologna (italy) for 6 years and after those years there unfortunately none of these look  like a real good one. oh boy, i miss that place too much, there was even a university called carpigiani (gelato university)  where the ice cream & patisserie is the only department.
nut allergies kinda suck lol
really thought out! mmh wondering if this comment will hit the generateor as well...
me to see all these beautiful people eating cremaglace in the middle of hot summer, in 2019 without a pandemic it made me aggressive, and a little sad: /
bélanger. chambord corner.
i was telling myself the same thing
and their chocolate is really good too, they're by far my favourite for a vanilla soft serve dipped in dark chocolate.
amazing soft serve unlike diperie down the street which i have no clue why it gets lineups.
> two 17-year-olds then get out of the car. the duo attempt to kidnap a teenage boy of the same age who was just leaving school. a friend of the person concerned wanted to intervene. both victims were beaten and sustained minor injuries. one of the suspects fired in the air, before fleeing by car.
what the fuck
> the alleged shooter was checked in the evening. first arrested for assault and attempted kidnapping, he was released with conditions after meeting with investigators.
hm ...
the guy recruited 3 criminal friends (gangsterism? premeditation?), got a pistol (handgun = restricted weapon, so most likely illegally), drove around with a loaded prohibited army, unloaded this weapon in a public place, committed assault and armed assault on a minor, fled from the police, was caught ...
then at the final or he said it's cool take your $ 200, pass go, pis play another round while waiting ?!
calvary, if all that doesn't get the policeman to say "ok my boyfriend, you're going to spend the night in jail waiting to see a judge" then what the fuck does it take?
come on, it seems to me that if you are a government that is grappling with a problem of gun violence among young people, the first thing you do is make it as hard as possible for them: if you get hit with a pistol, you go inside while awaiting your trial, no possibility of release before 2/3 of the sentence, worse matters like that, tse?
not surprisingly. i frequented curé-antoine-labelle and polyjeunesse during my adolescence, they are not really the most thawed pogos in the company, let's say ...
story time
i have a teenager in a rough public school and another in a private college, say, to paint a top 10, and neither one of them is really reacting to all this news about possession. use of weapons by young guys of +/- their age.
and they're not tough at all, even rather nice, neat nerds, mindful of their business and anxious to do the right thing and have friends on the sidelines. but even them, it does not give them a big deal ... i tell them that it becomes our business when it is passers-by, people not linked to the crime who are affected, and their reaction is rather fatalistic.
while we are a united family, we go out, play sports together, we discuss every day, at lunch, when we come back from school (2 parents working from home) and at dinner, still do some of their homework at the table because we care about what they are learning, etc. and, despite that, they are desensitized.
at the start of the school year the youngest received repeated anonymous threats by text message that basically said "bring you $ 200 to such and such a place at such time", a place really close to our place, "if you are not. there, we know where your family lives ". he had no idea who it was coming from, was not in conflict with anyone, etc., so he concluded that it was not addressed to him. to put it bluntly, he was rather indifferent ...
for my part, i ended up finding (through friends and relatives of friends interposed, a whole maze) that it was about a boy whom he knew from elementary school. i call her mother and forward the texts to her; she condoms very stiff, and i hear her son tell her that it was a joke. heille. if i was flabergasted, i think she was even more so. i didn't file a complaint with the police, but we had a serious four-way discussion ...
all this to say that it is really in tune with the times and that no family / community can overcome this culture of chnoutte by itself. it is everyone's responsibility to "catch up" with young people as soon as possible, without isolating parents. our children are exposed to all this despite us; we can raise them in maximum conditions and live in an environment light years away from those presented to us in the media as being the most affected by this culture, it ends up reaching (us) the same.
jesus. fucking. christ. what the fuck.
well ... we have made it to the top, eh.
apparently, it is poverty that turns young people into psychopaths ... even if these young people come from rich families.
the violence must stop. i love my city and i hate it when this kind of thing happens.
well, it's not just mourial going badly.
just sublime mate
i have read some that montreal is the city that has had the most school shots. that in all of north and south america no city (in the school) has had as many as the province of quebec.
are you true?
(sorry for my french lol)
> two 17-year-olds then get out of the car. the duo try to kidnap a teenager
yesterday, in montreal-nord around 4 pm-4:30pm, a teenage girl (15-16 years old) was approached by a suspect, taken in the arm, shot in the street, and the guy tried to get her into a car (possibly with an accomplice driving) ... a lady who saw the situation dialed 911, blocking the street with her vehicle, the police arrived and the guy was arrested / handcuffed
i don't know any more, but fuck that scares the same day in broad daylight.
it's hallucinating
something similar happened in my suburb too, wannabe gangsters.
a real movie all that. coming soon to a soap opera near you
dude i graduated high school with 3 murderers (the same murder) and they served 3.5 out of 11 years sentenced.
two possible reasons behind this, in my opinion:
1. the suspect has agreed to cooperate with the police to enable them to trace the source of the weapon in question.
2. the police did not find the weapon during the arrest. so they hope the guy is aunt enough to go back and get her after coming out of the interrogation, and he's being watched.
it takes at least 18 years to have a pal or rpal, so definitely illegal.
also, if you are at home and get attacked, and fire a warning shot, well you will have all your stock confiscated, lose your license, and at best you will spend years in court, if not fine + prison.
it should come as no surprise that the license holders are crying to always be the scapegoats and to see their stock become prohibited while the real criminals get away with a slap in the face.
really ... poor teens who hang out there because it's the only school in their area. violence is present almost every day there: '(
that's an actual expression people use? well alright then.
i am not against. (and i don't have a car)
it takes bollards on the streets, it takes bollards in public and private garages.
totally agree. and not just in montreal, all over the province. this is what made me rent a hybrid vs a 100% electric car, the fear of running out of charging stations. i do not understand why all gas stations and rest areas do not contain more. we want fewer polluting vehicles, but the electric car is still like a car that should be used for short trips only ...
absoutely. you can't encourage (or force) people to choose electric vehicles if they don't have charging stations. when i was shopping for my car, i looked for terminals around my neighborhood and frankly it was pathetic.
it's a bit of nonsense ... norway is the country where electricity is (and by far) the most democratized in the world, the comparison of any territory vs oslo will always be to the advantage of the latter ... i have a full electric in montreal, i always have terminals available less than 500m from my home (i have 6 in this radius, always 3-4 free minimum at all times ). i was in sept-iles on vacation this summer with the car, i have a range of about 450km (summer, not winter eh: d), and there were ultra-fast terminals (400km recharged in 50 mins) throughout the journey. terminals, and a really dense network, we already have it in quebec, it is more electric cars (and not those atrocious 'plug in hybrid' eh), therefore more government aid that is needed (in especially on second-hand bevs), no more terminals (although i find it cool, it's just that we have more than enough) ...
1- montreal is "car cancel culture". go to the park bench at the corner of iberville / hochelaga to read a book in traffic, but you'll never have a terminal for your tank, forget that: town planners don't find it beautiful.
2- they managed to sell the cars but not the charging infrastructure that goes with it: it's always been stupid to believe that you were going to arrive and oh a terminal! you will always fight for a terminal in montreal, always, no matter how many there are.
3- you will not have fast-charging city buses, quite simply because there is no room for charging infrastructure: it will be slow charges during the night. they will never prioritize charging stations for individual vehicles when there is not even any for public transport.
it still has to be functional! 
there is a case that i do not catch: there are cyclists and eco-responsible citizens in montreal who are tired of tanks because it pollutes and is dangerous for cyclists. but even when we are going to have plenty of electric tanks, the people who drive like troudkus are still going to be dangerous and that even means that there will probably be more tanks in montreal, since some eco-responsible citizens will buy them. , since it does not pollute. so i do not understand to see so many montrealers being so much for the idea of electric tanks ....
no! we don't need more terminals. we need more fast charging station and not the stupid "rapide" or "ultra rapide" of the electric circuit which makes a maximum of 50 kw at best.
it takes \ _at least \ _ of 100 kw and it must be on the edge of highways and major transport axes. tse, recharging an electric car will always take longer than that of a gasoline car, so you have to save time somewhere. so between montreal and quebec a few stopping points that represent detours of 3 min maximum with about fifty charging stations> 100 kw. this is an infrastructure that really changes mentalities.
nb: 100 kw is not an exaggeration as a minimum since the new tesla terminals make 250 kw.
there is a problem with all of that.
the electrification of the automobile is fine, but at some point the electricity network will have difficulty supplying it. you can't just plug in plenty of charging stations everywhere you want. it could overload the network.
it takes a massive investment at the provincial level with hydro-quebec to ensure the success of such a project. and still i find that it is not very realistic.
i am quite sure that with the measures announced, the producers of electric cars will not be able to supply on demand. the batteries we have at the moment are not sufficiently adequate for mass production, due to the minerals required for its production and also due to limitations in terms of recharge time and heat problems during rapid recharging.
it takes us a solid state battery to hell with it and we need to prioritize the expansion of public transit - and not just municipal. it takes us more fast trains between regions.
and not just in the rona parking lots.
quebec is the largest producer of electricity in north america. it would be a good thing.
it takes streets in good condition too hen!
this idea blew my mind.
at road stops!
the terminals are big and ugly, can you do anything underground? in town it's going to be super horrible ...
it takes the metro everywhere 😜
it also takes terminals in the alley parking lots behind the condo / apartment blocks.
although i have no great hope that it will happen.
it takes good ones to recharge quickly, and when i say fast, as fast as filling up with gasoline, otherwise they look like cows plugged into machines, but here it is the cows that receive milk from the terminal
truly? the [fear of running out of terminals?] ( are you in a corner where there are none at all?
don't you think that with more electric cars the terminals next to your house which are always free will no longer be?
try shwap club. they will give you a store credit for every piece of clothing they take.
empire exchange?
i think you can do this at marché noir on ontario

commenting because i’m also curious. i’ve heard of renaissance but have never experienced it myself!
your garage
nobody wants to buy your mustard stained white tank tops
they’re very picky they say no zara, fast fashion… which is what i mostly have
rennaissance takes donations, they do not buy
i'm sorry for you, but fast fashion is usually a no go for thrift resellers. it will be hard finding a shop that will want those kind of pieces. what you can try is selling them yourself on websites like depop, or do a garage sale this summer
but "professionnal" clothes resellers? though luck.
yeah, i make a couple trips a year to renaissance to drop off older clothing. it goes back into circulation. (as im\_pod said, its a donation. you get nothing tangible.)
i know that’s what i was saying. i know there’s places like in germany where you can both buy and sell clothes by weight
you have to believe that people needed a change
why the most densely populated district voted for coderre
would be a good idea to have a label on each map for clarity.
source-better view of map: [
plant: purple
coderre: blue
holness: green (very small)
map of the bourgeoisie circa 2021
i dont get it.
thought pm had rdp already?!
anyhow, pm got stronger in ahuntsic.
the most densely populated borough is the plateau mont-royal. are you referring to parc-ex? if so, it's because it's mostly immigrant, isn't it? i am under the impression that in quebec, communities often follow the most "liberal" meaning since it is the political avenue that opens the most doors to economic emancipation.
every card chalice posted here makes no distinction between
- vote for the town hall
- vote for the borough
- vote for the advisor
rdp is typically the kind of place to vote coderre, but to vote locally for the pm candidate. (or vice versa, whatever)
yeah, that must be it. and it seems that parc-ex is denser (21,000 / km2) than the plateau (12,840 inhab./km2) but wikipedia tells me that
thanks for the precision!
yes, that's why i referred to the borough rather than the neighborhood, otherwise parc-ex must be the densest.
the difference is that the mayoress and the chief of police did not take a photo op on the death of meriem.
refuse the search get suspended , get searched find vape pen get suspended. since when are staff members allowed to pull strip searches? searching a backpack or desk is one thing but asking to remove clothing is a charter violation.
seal wadding
for a while i thought i was in the onion journal
of course the ministry of education sides with these messed up teachers.
revolting. i hope the families take legal action.
what would have happened if female students were subjected to the same process?
in my opinion, if it's bad enough to want to search under clothing, it's bad enough to call the police and parents instead. if it's not bad enough to call the police or the parents, drop it.
if a teacher asked one of my children to lower his cullotes, i would file so many lawsuits on him that his descendants would need a lawyer.
it should be so simple to keep students in class, and to not coercively strip them. easy even.their drug policy (which may be federally or provincially imposed) is archaic, punitive and carceral, and is not designed to keep students in schooling, but to intimidate, humiliate, and abuse students; it does nothing to prevent drug use, educate about drug use, or humanise drug users.
if you are making students strip at school, that is sexual harassment; these kids should take legal action, this was totally unwarranted.
more trouble for the lester b. pearson school board. oh well.
not for a weapons search. not for a drugs search. but for vapes. insane.
when i was in high school a fee decades ago all the students would smlle cigarettes on the steps of the school at every break and it was fine.
times have changed but i don't know if this is better.
"the lester b. pearson school board says it is investigating and in a statement said it did "not believe there was any malicious intent underlying these actions."
so if someone doesn't know something is wrong, it's ok?
all this for a vaper? serious??
sue that school. doesn't matter if the kid was being disrespectful or not, it's insane that they even considered this.
2005: montreal students upset after being told to hike their pants
2021: montreal students upset after being told to drop their pants
we need a new national holiday to reflect and reconcile with the victims of this crime
one way of thinking of this is that we entrust schools with our children, and occasionally they have to wield the power of parents. if this teenager had been embarrassed by a search by his parents, it wouldn’t be in the news.
[deleted]
> searching a backpack or desk is one thing but asking to remove clothing is a charter violation.
desk and locker is ok, school property. backpack requires police to empty it out.  they can however ask you to empty it out, at this point you pull out w/e you want and thats it, they cant force themselves in, but you can also refuse, period.

its not rly about siding with the teachers, they just wanna avoid possible conflicts with the unions...
try thèsez-vous, near metro jarry. the space is specially thought for phd students who are in redaction. you can book your spot for 5$/4h, get free coffee and tea, can bring your lunch. the students work/study/write for 50min, then everybody takes a break at the same time for 10min, and go for another 50min stretch. it saved my sanity for the last year of my phd.
not sure about university spaces but the banq can be a nice place to work/study.
try one of the anticafés, the originals were cheap coffee shops where you pay by the hour for unlimited coffee, snacks, wifi, etc. some of them are still cheap, new ones are a bit fancier and expensive
the one on place des arts is super cozy but pre-covid was overcrowded
try the one on ontario est for a more neighbourhood vibe and is even an antique furniture store at the same time
go to udem. just straight up walk in and go to a library or to a computer lab, no one will stop you.
you can also go to the désautels school of mcgill on weekdays straight through the front door.
if you're feeling adventurous there is also an underground entrance to burnside hall that is open in the day all days of the week.
you're technically not allowed right now because of pandemic measures, but no one cares. actually, people care so little there is a homeless person that has essentially been living in burnside hall for a few years now.
thesez-vous has co-working spaces in montreal (around jean talon/jarry métro). you need to reserve the spaces and they go fast, but they're specifically geared towards graduate students writing/working. they also organize writing retreats outside of the city if you're into that (or at least they did pre-covid).
i mean they can be busy and crowded but i'm the concordia library as i type this and its not super crowded. 2 seats to my right and two seats to my left are empty. other spots to work and study would be actual university classrooms that are usually empty at this time but doors are unlocked. mcgill and concordia specifically. otherwise, theres crew collective cafe its beautiful and most people are there working and studying
atwater library, westmount library, mordecai-richler library
depending on your budget, crew café has a coworking space (separate section from the actual café), where you can rent a desk! lots of people i know have tried it and loved it as they now work from home!
not sure where you're located, but the vanier library on concordia's loyola campus is cozy af and it was always pretty easy to find a quiet corner. little out of the way though.
try the bibliothèque des lettres et sciences humaines (blsh) on the université de montréal campus. it's huge and always quiet, even when crowded
insiders cafe and cowork is good place! they have a location on crescent and st.denis.
maybe look into "breather"? used it a few years ago, they might still be active.
uqam science library at place des arts. there's no one downstairs.
caravan cafe in côté des neige has a working space upstairs. it’s a cozy place with free coffee and tea.
library at berri uqam. gorgeous spot
edit:there are also we work spaces i can't remember the name but there is a cooperative one on ontario i think in the east end. maybe your employee would be ok with that. it's slightly across the street from atomic café.
bain colonial is quite relaxing and they serve an all you can eat sausage buffet.
oh my god. this is incredible. 
i'm in a similar situation to op and this is exactly what i need right now.
wow! it makes me want to register for a doctorate!
it became 6$ :(. many universities offer promotional codes though. but +1 for thèsez vous, its the only place i actually get shit done productively.
is that only for phd students?
they should take the test at 3:52 am to make it more realistic. / s
surprisingly, their strategy to raise awareness is to send out false alarms.
edit, for example:
before, i lived in a condo where the ground floor was shared by mcdonald's. regularly they triggered the fire alarm by mistake during the night. after a couple of times, the world would still lie down at the sound of the alarm.
when the car wash next door caught fire at 2am, everyone who couldn't see the fire from their window thought it was mcdonald's again, but this time it was very true (fortunately, the firefighters contained the fire well).
testing for next lockdown and curfew
incredible these tests! it will ring a bell
it's finish
the damn thing ignored game launcher's dnd and popped right on top of my game.
ah, the joys of a rooted phone: i just disable the services of the app, and the app itself. if i want news, i'll seek it myself. nothing else then an alarm, to me
for me it's the opposite effect, it desensitizes me. after all of the amber alerts have no reporting hours and also 1-2 alerts for the covid, i don't even look anymore until i close the window.
it's more a check that the system is working than awareness. no matter what they say though, they are going to get pissed off because there is always someone who is going to whine.
do you think amber alerts should just be at reasonable times ...?
ok calm down, there were hardly any alerts
almost no one looks before closing the window: this is the only way to silence the alarm. and once you silence the alarm, you can no longer read the alert.
it's an absolutely bad design.
he may also think that amber alerts should not use the highest level of alert available which indicates danger to your life immediately.
the world is removing the option because it rings at 3 or 4 in the morning. in addition, the alert is the same as a nuclear attack.
why not get off a step or 2? it would be better. to date all the alarms we have been at crazy hours, or almost.
underrated comment.
yes.
the objective is to invite quebecers to be attentive to specific characteristics in children and their companions. for that, it is necessary that the people who receive the alert read it attentively, then they go out to have a chance to see the said child.
by sending the alert in the wee hours, say 3 to 5 am (we had one not so long ago in these hours it seems to me), you reach 2 groups of people mainly: those who are at the end shift and already have little attention and people sleeping. very unlikely that these 2 groups of people will read the amber alert attentively to pay special attention during the following day.
you send the same alert at 7-8 o'clock in the morning (a delay of about 4 hours, not that much), those who have just gone to bed following their shift sound in tabarnak, but it looks like it is. is okay to wake up the world. those who have just got up have already had a coffee and can read the alert carefully, then go out to work. my opinion is that the government is very fortunate in achieving its goal of having teens and adults paying attention with the second scenario. worse, you don't piss off like 75% and more of quebecers.
i am already calm.
i'm just saying that it has the opposite effect of the government's objective on me.
you just have to go to r / quebec to read the alert after having changed the ringing license.
that's valid as a criticism, but that's not what op complained about.
how dare they, try to find a missing and possibly endangered child while sleeping, not much less important than my sleep or a bomb. he would have to whisper it in the streets instead, they would find more life and without disturbing us! / s

it happens in every election, people make human errors and since everything is by hand ...
journal de montréal makes a big headline that fears everybody.
there are and always will be irregularities in the counting of votes.
and i prefer that there are paper votes rather than electronic votes.
for often having to recount my cash register twice or more during the time i was working at the grocery store ....
quite a mistake ...
> denis coderre received no votes in the official tally for mayor of montreal, even though his local candidates got 22 and 32 respectively. meanwhile, communist league mayoral candidate beverly bernardo has got his best score in town: 35 votes.
they describe as an “irregularity” anything that does not follow the trend. it's sensational, but i don't see anything in the article that looks like a fraud. their investigation consists of looking for figures in a spreadsheet that deviates from the statistical average, the larger the sample, the more there will be. i have no trouble believing that the inhabitants of the same street have decided to vote marxist en masse… across montreal, there must be a sub-community of marxists somewhere. they also imply that everyone votes for the same part at the 3 levels without taking into account the candidates (and that everyone votes at the 3 levels). in 2 weeks the same investigative journalists will find the street with the most christmas decorations in montreal and call it an irregularity.
> * ballot box 56: curiously, the independent candidate for mayor of montreal dimitri mourkes had 82.

that's a lot of votes for an npc!

no surprise with their labor problems described before the election
another big pauvre conspiracy against the oppressed on the right.
calmos, mistakes like that happen all the time and it's just important for serious struggles where there will be a recount.
stop the steal! count those ballots! stop the vote!
you're not even original
so we have a system where we can quickly see anomalies, with open data for all citizens, and a protocol for recounting all the ballot boxes that we want.
and do we have an integrity problem?
big poor wow
you know what would help? certainly not tougher gun laws or any of that shit. 
how about social programs for disenfranchised youths? how about communities denouncing the street gangs in their own communities instead of protecting them? how about parents parenting and providing better role models for their children instead of 6ix9ine?
its a sad state of affairs right now. and inflation, wage stagnation, and the overall economy certainly doesn't help those at risk.

not against the stupid ones who want to take our arms.
it’s right next to us, as much the murder as the walking.
it's almost as close as what happened 15th / crémazie two months ago.
ridicule.
what will a walk do anyways? as if someone was pro-violence. it is not a demonstration that will do what.
we had elections and the world elected the status quo. there will be no change. the federal liberal seized the opportunity to strengthen his law on legal matters, that did not change anything, they welcome it.
it's just ridiculous that we have come to this in montreal.
just saying. there is no solution to the rise in violence that is achievable in a liberal state as one lives today.
check the first comment
"how about social programs for disenfranchised youths?"
lol
> certainly not tougher gun laws or any of that shit
they might. closer to 9/10 firearms used in violent crimes in canada are illegal (as in never legally owned in canada) firearms mostly smuggled in from the us. 
despite this, recent (2017) legislation removed all mandatory minimum sentences related to firearms offences, for individuals, convicted of a criminal offence with an illegal firearm. 
but it gets better, the recent order in council (2020) re-classified about 100,000 different firearms that were up until that point legal to purchase if you obtained the correct licence, as prohibited. meaning that over night, a lawful gun owner, with a lawfully obtained firearm, now possessed a firearm that if they transported or used at a range, would be facing criminal sanctions that still have a mandatory minimum prison sentence of 1 year if convicted.
maybe if we imposed as harsh of penalties on criminals with illegal guns committing violent crimes with them, as we did on law abiding canadians, we'd make some progress.
i agree with you, except where you oppose "certainly not tougher gun laws". there is still a difference between a young person under the influence of a gangster culture, and an importer of organized crime weapons, and i'm sure that "gun laws" apply quite differently from one to the other. other.
as the little girl from old el paso would say: porque no los dos?
as you said, this economy will have a major impact on things to come. violence will only increase if people can't afford rent, food and other basic necessities.
wô there ... you ask a lot.
it already takes better income for employees, more affordable rents, fewer working hours to take care of our families, social programs.
heille, it costs all that money!
/s
they dont use legal gun. but social program and social help for the people in need is necessery
people need to stop with this kind of discourse. the solution is two pronged: better enforcement and better alternatives. yet, a lot of people here are gaslighting and ignoring that gun laws or 'any of that shit' have an essential role in fixing the problem.
ultimately, yes, the system has a role in the problem, but we must not forget that there is an individual responsibility to the people who decide to engage in violent crime.
guns have no place in canadian society.
unfortunately there will not be so many people.
a 16 year old boy with no connection to sweet fuck all.
support the family? help young people to assimilate their trauma? let's see what rock you live under.
in addition, it is difficult to do a drive by stabbing.
canada already has tough as shit gun laws in regards to acquiring a legal firearm. more restrictions on that won't help the illegal guns already in the country.
for example, banning legal handguns on the island of montreal, won't do fuck all for gun crime. banning arbitrarily black rifles because they look scary and "assault-y" makes zero sense either.
which laws would you make tougher?
it was obvious: the application of force is proportional. the more the guy struggles, the more force must be applied. it was the guy's reaction that caused the intervention to degenerate.
i'm reading the comments and there are really 2 different issues here.
1 - should the stm ask the officers to use force when a passenger does not pay and tries to escape?
2 - the officers used force not pcq the guy jumped the turnstiles (they stop dozens a week without using force) but pcq he tried to duck, struggled and showed signs aggression towards them.
man the girl screaming was annoying. if anything, screaming like that for no reason makes things worst, because the guards cannot think properly.
i like your work m8
that’s point of busting someone on the turnstile just check fares randomly as they do in europe.
[deleted]
so we conclude this is normal and accepted procedure for a jumped turnstile? we're okay with this?
i dont get it.
jump the turnstile; get tackled harder than brady after his defensive line failed to block the blitz.
i'd toss a creampie in a politician's face and wouldnt even get tackled that hard ffs.
this response gets me every time -  but he was resisting!  ya no shit, most people will have an automatic defense response to being tackled/arrested/restrained.  that's why de-escalation tactics exist...
we have a "genius" (/ s) judge who decided it was illegal.
- violation of the metro code
- refuse to identify with a peace officer after having committed an offense
- take flight while under arrest
- resist his arrest
yes, just for 3.50 ...
yeah, because the video doesn't show everything that hapened before, and the guy was really agressive. 
don't trust everything you see on social media.
yes, we are.
stop pretending that it's "fair" because he skipped the turnstiles: it's because he skipped the turnstiles, it's caught, refused to identify himself then fled and eventually resisted his arrest and assaulted the officers.
there are cases where law enforcement officers are wrong, but it is not.
your example is not very good ... approach jean chrétien to see if you are going to be strangled or not lol
heille, he had just jumped the turnstiles, he was not stopped by chance, so his "defense reflex", he can put it on or i think: he is the aggressor.
the thing is, we don't know from that video if de-escalation tactics were used. maybe they were, and failed. 
all that we have is the report of an independant attorney who says that the agents are not to blame. so what the videos shows is now a moot point, and the real discussion is: can we trust the judgment of that attorney, and if not, why?
i hate that this comment is being disliked.. so many boot lickers in montréal
bitten someone until blood ...
in the middle of a fucking pandemic !!!!
ive seen a guy jumping the turnstile and get arrested at square-vic, just before covid and it was a sad ass scene.
guy went down the stairs with us(gf and i)as we passed with our cards, he jumped and ran for it towards the cote-vertu direction, but the arriving train was going the other direction, so he got screwed. the agents came running downstairs, the guy tried to run past them and vlam bam flim flam shimmy shim sham, guy was tackled, almost made a solid corkscrew 900 misty flip before landing in a semi-majestic as fuck position, something a cirque du soleil contortionist would have been jealous about... but ouch.... all that for $3.50?  good thing there are no red lights in the metro...
phew, some of the submissions are just horribly bad
i nominate louis riel. the métis leader hanged by macdonald, a prominent figure in the indigenous and francophone history of quebec and canada
someone suggested making it a rotating platform of statues, every year or so get a new one and replace it. don't know how well that would work out economically but i think it'd be cool.
cool to use the word charette.
we should put a statue of rené lévesque, it's his boulevard and he should look at the sun life building which changed its address which was on dorchester when the boulevard changed its name.
in addition, macdonald was a racist colonizer bordering on fascist and lévesque is an inclusive liberator, that will put the weight on the change that the country is making.
i'm not entirely sure if there already is a statue somewhere, but i'd think it be cool to have a statue of leo major.
he fought in wwii and successfully got an entire nazi occupied town to surrender by himself by tricking them with grenades. he's french canadian, and a war hero to match the war memorial behind the pedestal. if another war hero is suggested, i'd be open to it as well.
i've seen some people mention louis riel which i also thought was good but i'm not sure if that would be the best place for him because the war memorial is behind him, but if he got a statue somewhere i think it would be a good idea.
however, for the mention of rene levesque, bold to suggest it but respectfully, no. or non if you prefer. if you want a french canadian up there then it should be a uniting figure, not a separatist and definitely not a separatist in montreal.
it would have a bit of a soviet feel, but we could make one of healthcare workers.
[it's a good one]( unlike your link :-p
would rene have given half of quebec to the indigenous peoples or he would have used the same excuse as the colonizers “oh we are all quebecois”.
hear i tell you this as an immigrant and visible minority. i have never seen a people spit as much on their founding fathers as the whites of the west.
the memes and satire we did about the white guilt have come true lol. you have to understand that every people has committed crimes. the only difference is that you made them at a time when the world was starting to be more and more connected. and so it remained marked, because everyone could talk about it.
it seems to me that there is no sunlife door that opens onto rené lévesque.
there is a statue of rené lévesque on this boulevard 
> the only difference is that you made them at a time when the world was starting to be more and more connected.
so give me an example? the james bay treaty?
it was their legal address at the time, they changed the day the boulevard changed its name.
> the only difference is that you made them at a time when the world was starting to be more and more connected.
> so give me an example?
what do you mean ?
sorry, i don't believe you.
as it predates the internet, information is difficult to find, but i will find it.
i would like that. i find it hard to believe that the address is in a place without a door. the sunlife company left in 1978; dorchester became rené levesque in 1987. le carré dominion (dominion square) became carré dorchester. it's hard to find history when it changes with governments.
in la presse, he mentions that the chef is acting.
so, they will look for a denis 3.0 or a former federal / provincial elected representative.
who?
this texture has navigated right into my heart.
gaétan barrette!
he's a ville saint laurent councilor
if it's to avoid valérie plante, why not
unfortunately for you, barrette does not live in montreal.
how do we avoid valérie plante? we go around the bush! haha!
it just takes 1 year of living. there is enough time before 2025
or we leave montreal before the wokist invasion of qs in the next elections
"i am moving to your city to be your mayor"
very winner! / s
he will first have to go to montreal before valérie plante forbids white men to cross bridges.
it is fully happening for federal and provincial elected officials
i miss the chinese buffets.
horrible singing is back !!!
good for them!
no mentions of asian-owned karaoke, might be worth checking them out and supporting them too: pang pang + bar k are my faves.
damn, i never knew karaoke was that popular.
yuck 🤮
it's been open for a long time
it's part of the fun though!
i missed it so much 😍
i miss the old karaoke bar in front of cock and bull
you have to go to the right karaoke!
they have been opened for a while
pang pang has been open for awhile
why lol
it's the reopening craze. people enjoy it, and it had been more a year since they've been able to karaoke.
title of your sextape.
to eat with a buffet or by order?
exactly, aren't the * good * karaoke the ones where the singers are not? years ago, but my ex and i picked up at a tavern in pointe-st-charles (which still exists, but the name escapes me) during karaoke night. one cheesy song after another, more than doubtful interpretations, but damn that we had laughed. bad music, but the vibe was great because it was obvious that people were there to have fun and not to try to impress anyone.
i know bar k had been operating as a bar since it's been allowed, has pang pang been having karaoke nights?
because without asians, there'd be no karaoke. and it's nice to support other small local businesses that have suffered through this pandemic.
empathy towards our fellow beings is lacking. how do we get it back?
isn't that where they build luxury condos? on the old site of the children's hospital? what an irony
winter is gonna be rough
what i don't get is that there is a shelter/warming tent probably 100 feet away from where she died.  the story says she was kicked out of the metro entrance and that is about 10 feet away from the shelter.
could be that she was suffering with mental illness..... that would explain a lot...... sad situation 🙏⚰
the title of this post is dehumanizing. 👎
[removed]
it's a feature, not a bug.
an economy should exist to serve a society, but instead our society now serves the economy. for this to work, people have to be forced into work by making them afraid of something. if we helped all the homeless, fed them and lodged them, then no one would be afraid of being jobless and homeless and wouldn't just accept being exploited as easily.
it also helps that everyone has had the idea beaten into their heads that it's ok to be selfish and to ignore the suffering of others. because our economic system also depends on us being as selfish and individualistic as possible. the less we support each other and work together, the easier we are to exploit.
it's possible the shelter was full, or she was refused entry for some reason, or maybe she was intoxicated and passed out before reaching it.
when i worked at mcdonald near downtown ( metro frontenac) i realised that about half of the people who were homeless where people with mental illness while the other half were people who had drug addictions. there are no resources for them so they are left on the street. its really sad because as far as im concerned, they are both health condition and should be treated that way. leaving these people freezing in our street and having to deal with violent gang member is unfair and cruel. it wouldnt make sense to let someone who became disable due to a workplace accident rot in the street, so why we allow people with addiction and mental illness to have such an horrible life.
we watch this happen and do nothing. maybe *we* are the mentally ill.
i hope you never find yourself in a situation where you don't have a place to house yourself for winter.
you’re a bad person.
come on now that is a horrible thing to say
not the first time i hear that hot take, i think it's interesting.
how do you picture the emergence of such a system? do you think there is some conscious autority purposefully creating / allowing homelessness so as to scare people? or do you think it's simply an emergent property of any capitalist society? is it something else? natural selection of culture, maybe?
i, myself, find it hard to believe there would be people with the power, the interest and the malice to do such a thing, but i can see the theory being defended. i haven't thought about the systemic hypothesis hard enough to have a semi-working theory.
from my understanding, they are pretty much a no refusal place (unless, i imagine, they are extremely violent).  they opened up that tent last year after a person froze to death since they were refused entry to another shelter.  he was either drunk or had an animal (can't remember which) and therefore no allowed in most shelters.
there are ressources, a lot of them simply chose to not use them for a variety of reasons.
there are places where you can volunteer to make a difference
covid breakouts have the shelters breaking their general “no refusals policy” last i checked there were 5 or 6 active breakouts meaning those shelters aren’t accepting new intakes.
the owner defends himself by saying that he should have indicated: "from $ xx.xx / hour". with or without experience in the kitchen, whether you are 20 or 45, a person cannot live with dignity at minimum wage, let alone in montreal.
it's paid more at mcdo!
i know someone who worked at the cabane du pied de cochon. wages have always been shitty, but it's also the hours and the number of hours worked that are insane. not uncommon for him to do more than 12 hours in a day being paid at a fixed rate per day ... it often came down to the minimum wage ... is what was expected of all. well, we're talking about it, but it's been like that for years ...
i am a cook, and it is too low for the work they require.
too low at all, but also for the job requested.
labor shortage uh? sounds more like a living wage shortage.
it's trying to do pr
again if you have 20 years experience in any other industry you'll be making more money compared to hospitality. i've been doing this for 25 years and don't waste your time, you'll work weekends, holidays and be in some terrible conditions. it's not worth it do something else.
oh non, pauvre monsieur beaudin can’t afford renos on his second chalet in the laurentians if he pays a living wage..
fuck you bud, stand over the grill yourself.
there's a shit job like that
hey ... i'm surprised to see that there is money scam in the restaurant business ....... 🙄🙄🙄
at least he posts it on his ad, goes straight in and the guy is going to end up increasing his offer. no time wasted with an interview to get you offered 13.50 at the end.
would you be worth blasting his google review? (being honest, not talking about the food falsely, but writing that he underpays the employees)
if it's a legal salary and he can find employees, where is the problem?
salaries in kitchens also vary in relation to your station. a grill cook will typically make more than a garde manger.  you have to of course take into consideration experience.
but yea he's full of shit with that statement.  he wants to pay the lowest possible wage while putting the most possible in his own pocket.  some people will still want to work there for the reference on the cv.  same thing for normand laprise at toque. might pay better salaries but you're working 60-70 hours a week.
every holiday season picard hires a bunch of people to keep up with the production of his items (pies n' shit).  as far as i know, pre pandemic, most of those temp hirees were paid minimum salary.
yep i worked there not very long but the 5pm shift was commonplace (no break to eat obviously that would be too complicated tse)
> not uncommon for him to work more than 12 hours in a day being paid at a fixed rate per day ... it often came down to the minimum wage
pretty sure that is actually illegal...
unemployment due to covid ends soon if i'm not mistaken? sooner or later the people won't have a choice. the employers know this.
but "nobody wants to work" .... no, we want to but pay us.
there are dozens and dozens of new 1 star reviews :)
it is the nuance between legality and decency. some understand it, others don't.
that sounds interesting.
:thumbsup
construction uber?
looks like yes
> launched in february 2020, this young company presents itself as a digital platform capable of bridging the gap between owners wishing to undertake major renovations to their homes and general contractors who are often ill-equipped to meet information needs and details from their customers.
but the problem is always to find someone reliable
if we base ourselves on uber taxi ... it will produce extremes on both sides
for those who don't know, “au pied de cochon” is one of montreal's most famous (and among the most expensive) restaurants, which have fun paying their staff the minimum for very demanding conditions.
edit 1: yes i know front of house staff tips out to the kitchen, but it’s very small.
edit 2: i also know it isn’t the *most expensive* culinary destination in montreal, but it’s considered expensive for the average quebecois, and it’s unfortunate that with such a high average cheque that the staff is paid so poorly.
i made the post to highlight that the food service industry, which i grew up in and love so much, unfortunately continues to cling on to a broken business model. the idea is to stimulate discussion, that’s it.
i am very surprised ... i would never have imagined this kind of salary in this category of restaurant! it's a bit scandalous ...
just for context ... vices & versa, a beer bar with a fairly limited menu, pays its cooks $ 18 / hr with a percentage of service tips on top.
[
if a bar that serves fries and burgers can afford $ 18 / hr, it's a shame that a restaurant as famous as apdc is so stingy.
mcdo literally pays better than that.
wtf?!
it's not a labor shortage, it's a wage shortage!
it's as rich as cresus, this gang there. shame on you big hairy.
edit: gros lol, la presse which reads us. hello press
13$hr was crap when i was a cook 20 years ago. so glad i left that industry. is feeding a bunch of assholes worth evenings wkds holidays and stress? no thanks i cook at home now ....
so much of a bad working condition there too. they are also cocked to the maximum to be able to run. their sugar shack is practically run by slaves who have no life because they make them work 18 hours a day, 6 days a week.
i mean mcdonald’s offering $17+h. you have an abundance of choice to work wherever
it looks like the video game industry, the more famous the company, the less it pays. in the end saying, "it's a privilege to work here, and people line up ~~ girl ~~ to get your place."
at this price it deserves to be bombarded with false cvs.
i’ve been working in this industry for over 20 years. it doesn’t pay for experience it pays for the position needed. don’t dedicate your time to this industry unless you open your own place, it’s not worth it.
“i don’t understand why you don’t put the company above your life! we give you 13.50!!!???”
basically them.
treats you like shit, pays you like shit.
“yeah we need 25 000 more immigrants in the country each year because the population doesn’t buy in our bullshit”
nothing against immigrants as i am one. problem is their solution doesn’t fix anything rather they prey on desperate immigrants.
for the cherry on top, note that full time is not even guaranteed! they don't want to risk giving you blessings.
labor in the year 2021 is basically indentured servitude if ur not making at least 50,000 a year. things have gotten so expensive , and companies have not paid the average worker enough money in decades. companies are greeedy fucks. i dont dream of labour. employment is death
eurk. let's say 35 hours a week, that's roughly 24k per year. we are talking about $ 2000 per month in a corner where the 1 and a half rent $ 1200 per month. worse, i don't even think about taxes.
issshhh.
omg, i saw this this morning. downright insulting. i'm looking for myself better, as we always should, but i'm more grateful to do substantially more like line cook / grillman. it is absurd as a salary, doubly for the establishment.
and how much the tip of the waiters who probably don't want to share it.
there is no shortage of employees, just a shortage of work that pays enough to live on. unfortunately, small businesses that exploit workers still have more influence over politicians than workers.
denis coderre be like: no one takes the bixi
i really took advantage of bixi this year. usually twice a day.
i made profitable my subscription this summer that's clear.
i think my upstairs neighbours actually stole a bixi bike lol. they're moving out and they cleaned a green one out of their apartment. one of them rode off on it and didn't come back with it, so i guess they returned it?
one time i saw a bixi tandem during one of this summer's cycling events.
it is my favorite means of transportation during the summer. so practical and really inexpensive. (if you take the early birds subscription)
on the tracks shared between pedestrians and cyclists, electric bixi go too fast.
i always found it weird that every single time i want a bixi, all the racks in my area are completely empty. and the rare times i do see some on racks, i’ve never seen an electric one. just my luck i guess?
love out !!
it is really the ideal complement to the opus card. not to worry about having your bike stolen (i had it stolen every 2 years before), nor to pay to have it repaired or to restore it in the spring. no storage ... it's really convenient! and the stations cover more and more the island, allowing to walk for pleasure.
after the million passage on the rev and a record season for bixi, that i no longer see anyone saying that bicycle use is overestimated in montreal.
same. the electric one has been a blast to use. the pricing structure made it as economical as the metro and quicker too. the hardest part was to reliably find one when you want one.
i saw one in sainte-anne-de-bellevue last summer. talk about your 'wtf' moments.
is it actually possible to steal one what? i thought they could be remotely locked or localized ? no?
once my bixi bike didn't lock to the station, so they asked me if i could maybe keep it in my home until an employee came to pick it up.  maybe that's what happened to him haha. i just left it unlocked at the station
some people dont lock the bikes properly so you can just take them
same - i saw them on tour de l'ile!
it's psa super good bike for super long distance! ahaha it's funny the guy must have pedaled twice as hard as the others
electric bikes, period.
multifunctional tracks are a lot of the way to the base. it's not safe to have pedestrians and bicycles sharing the same small strip of asphalt.
occam’s razor: someone entered the wrong numbers when making a change (e.g. they looked up a lost card and got yours accidentally before transferring/deactivating), or a bug in the stm software.
just a couple guesses.
i have no idea about how that happened but i'm interested to see someone who knows answer
not only is the card encrypted and there is no known exploit, but there is no database for anonymous cards. it's all on the map. nothing he told you is consistent.
it looks more like something like the antenna breaking or other physical damage on the card. you could have tested this on a bus validator (which does not make any live network requests). but on the other hand, if it is really a "remote" deactivation then the metro validator has written it on the card.
that's terrible, stm needs to launch some investigation on this. anything can be hacked, it just depends if it's worth it.
the same thing happened to my bf and i card last week. we lost like 13 passes
in my opinion, such a transfer is only possible if an stm agent fraud, because the cards themselves cannot be cloned, as far as i know.
ask which agent deactivated your card, and contact stm security.
always keep the receipt that way you can claim it at the stm ticket office.
agents do not have access to all information. file a complaint on the site with your card number and the responsible team can investigate. they take this kind of thing seriously, because if there is one fraud, there may be others.
what's opus card's tech? nfc?
tickets are kept on the card.
so if your card had been cloned, you would still have your tickets.
the only thing connected to a database is a list of cards to deactivate when they scan, it is used for stolen cards and opus for the year when you cancel your subscription.
this exact same thing just happened to my husband. he had tried to catch the bus not to long ago and the card that he thought had passes wasn't working.
 fast forward a few days and he decides to go to the metro and fill up the card, turns out the card is deactivated so he buys a new card. 
i thought this was strange, cards expire? and said that he should talk to someone at stm as his credits should still be there and he should be able to transfer them over to the new card. now i'm thinking that's not going to happen and i'm wondering if there's actually an issue with their system that is causing the problem.
most likely a clerical error. opus cards with photo generally expire on october 31, so either your card was canceled by mistake, or the passes were transferred to a new card by mistake. (when renewing an opus card with photo, the stm employee will manually transfer the tickets from the old card to the new one.)
call or send an email to the stm, they are generally more useful than the counter employees.
why do you all buy a lot of passes?
"i purchased a 10 pack of passes (at station bonaventure)"
at one of the stm machines ?
there is so little benefit to doing this, i don't think anyone would go through the trouble.
when did you purchase the physical card first? these cards are only good for 2 years. 
after this, you need to go to a stm customer center to have your tickets transferred to a new card.
stm card cloning may be a thing but i have never heard about it.
it happened to me with a pass of the month! since that time, i only use recorded opus cards, even for tickets.
if you don't register your card then someone else might do it and report it stolen and get the fares back
all they need to have is the card number, which might be included in the sale receipt (i believe that's the case but not 100% sure)
if you threw away the receipt (or the agent kept it), someone might have found it and accessed the number to register the card and then reported it stolen or lost
is your card in good condition? has it been damaged recently?   
maybe you could have whiped the antenna? i don’t know if magnets, heat source, or other components could affect the chip or the antenna?
to verify your cards: 
he will soon have the guignolée, you can volunteer near your home to do door-to-door or sorting. it can be a great opportunity to chat with several people in french!
it's a bit far, but if you're interested in cleaning up rivers, there would be the green vigil, on the south shore
probably that in the facebook group "hochelaga mon quartier" there would be people with close opportunities.
i suggest you join it (if you're not already) and ask about it.
the [abc center] ( could help you find volunteer opportunities.
santropol roulant! it is an organization that does "meals on wheels" but you can do it on foot, by bike, by public transport or by car. it's very bilingual, so it's an excellent place to practice your french and discover montreal.
hospitals op, they all have volunteer post open because they’re always needed. if you want to practice french trust me this is. the best most consistent way since you’ll be basically helping people find ring their way or within the hospital, there’s lots of chatting too. the muhc, glen site is amazing, i’m biased because i’m a volunteer there, but hey, we are always looking for people who are willing
volunteering in chsld or hospital
chsld, retirement homes. they are hungry for conversation the poor.
i know the entraide léo-théoret in the center-sud. it's small and very close to the world
very good idea! look on the montreal volunteer action center website. you will be able to find plenty of offers to which you can apply. you have to create an account, but it's not very complicated. 
what interests you as a type of volunteering, and what are your availability? there are a lot of community organizations and associations in hochelaga, but many need only daytime during the week. quickly, there will be christmas baskets soon, and there is the chic resto pop which was looking for volunteers in the kitchen.
great idea, i hope it works out for you.
in english? you know, since lots of english speakers have experience with this...
thanks, i just emailed mtn!
oh no i'm not in the group, but i take a look
thanks, i'll check it out!
+1 updoot for santropol. i volunteered there for about 1 year and really liked the team :)
dm sent :)
yes i just saw a “friendship visit” program that could be a perfect option, thanks for the idea
honestly i am quite open to all possibilities, but obviously i have a preference towards qqc where i have to speak in french as often as possible. unfortunately i work during the day the week usually 9-6, so evenings and weekends
i mean, force everyone into self check outs and oopsie something may have accidentally fallen into my bag that i didnt pay for. 
i have no sympathy for grocery stores whose profits exploded during covid and did nothing to help their staff.
remember people. if you see somebody stealing food, you didn't.
as prices continue to rise it will only get worse. i’ve been in shops in the uk where stuff such as cheese, meats and other expensive items were tagged/ locked in plastic security cases.
good. can't be angry at hungry people. the system failed hard when you got to stealing food.
is there any hard numbers about this or just some moronic pseudo-journalists pulling shit out of their ass?
it's going to be a mess with winter coming and the fruits and vegetables arriving from the other side of the world.
i was asked to leave my freaking purse at the counter in a store the other day, citing too many shoplifting. i noped out very quick.
they just have to sell their cheaper gruyere osti
i sometimes buy vine tomatoes but at the machine i come in that they are red greenhouse tomatoes heheheheheh
let’s be honest here. the gazette and media in general loves to blow things out of proportion. people who shoplift have always been doing it
"“if you're stealing meat from a grocer, your aim is food service,” he said."
fury
restaurants typically have their own meat sources, with a certain quality testing. what restaurant buys the one or two piece a person can get away with via shoplifting from subpar grocers, with a break in the chain of refrigeration too.  chain restaurants benefit from an economy of scale from the franchise, higher end and medium high restaurants are picky af, and the rest of the business sources from different sorts of stores than grocers, generally in larger quantities leading to lower price anyways. 
what a nonsensical statement lmao
sad times. all i can say is that please be extra patient and giving to one another. i can’t imagine being jobless, hungry, low-income etc during these times :( especially those who are homeless. even if you don’t have spare change, try and offer a bottle of water, fruit, coffee, granola bar, anything. a little goes a long way and compassion can change someone’s day, week, and life!
don’t worry guys, the budget will balance itself when we have printed enough funnymoney /s
yeah criminalized the poor who want to survive instead of sending the thick ones to jail who printed more cash to help the poor on the pku. op stops spreading fud it doesn't help anyone. help your loved ones and neighbors and try not to waste.
which grocery stores had exploding profits? both loblaws/metro and their subsidiaries have had pretty average profits compared to past years.
grocery has one of the lowest profit margin
exploded profits? did everyone collectively start eating drastically more food or something?
have family in texas and breaking and entering has shot through the roof in their area, inflation hitting this hard is going to send a lot of desperate people over the edge.
baby formula.  protein shake powders.
these seem to be popular targets because they are non perishable and cost quite a bit for their volume.
this isn't poor children starving and struggling to get by. people are stealing stuff, like (as the article points out) alcohol and meats to resell.
hope those small groceries stores get the tools to slow theft down.
i went last year (second time) and was highly disappointed.  don't think i can recommend it again.
is it still $30 a beer?
it's ugly, the luminous cossin on an ugly metal foot, not even camouflaged.
hahahahah !!!!
osti all in the auto fucking.
"a ** safe three-kilometer driving course ** allowing visitors to experience the magic of illumi from the comfort of their vehicle."
you and i, friend, you and i  
where is that?
sending this to my fiancé
these are always a lot more fun than i'd expect.
oh! there weren’t any vegetables last year. don’t know if a huge eggplant is worth the ticket price though..
where was this picture taken?
do you mind sharing the ticket prices? me and my mother have been curious about going but have no idea of the entree fees!
illumi was so disappointing. maybe better in winter with snow everywhere??...
i can’t believe people spend actual money on watching led lights. passing by on the 15 southbound, it looks like the lamest thing on earth. 
i feel like even cultureless suburbanites would enjoy the chain restaurants at nearby centropolis more.
niceee 🙈
right? a good amount of pieces were off. snacks and alcohol prices are crazy. and really, some of them are super lame. the space part with the planets was soooooo meh. so much opportunity for creativity missed.
it's alright if you have young kids still amazed by that sort of thing, but yeah it's not really worth the price.
yup and you get to watch ads for ford and rogers…still beautiful though
it's in laval. of course, everything is in the car.
i did by foot, much better
illumi in laval
illumi
i searched and this is what i found:
vacant building built in 1987.
building name: lighthouse number 1.
5g
possibly linked to the fleuralie there was a long time ago?
age of empire 4 larp.
princess fiona is there
a goose hunting watch
i don't know much about it, but i would say a 5g tower to ignite the electromagnetic waves contained in our covid vaccines. or something like that.
one would snake.
probably a bicolline expansion project.
it's a synchronization point, you go up to the top, you look around and you jump in the lake, then it's going to update the hood around on google maps.
wow ... at least we have the year of construction ... so it was not built for the floralies (which took place in 1980)
😂
probably because it's not very far ...
opposite the building there had been a restaurant, now demolished for 6-10 years.
maybe it was related to this restaurant.
i just finished an aoe game and it looks so much like tricks in the game lol
the worst part is that it would be practical because there are surely geese who come to bathe in the area during the year. but i can hardly see people playing guns a few steps from the bike path.
ahah .. it took me a long time to understand the reference to assassin's creed
i know the date of construction is intriguing, considering it was built after the floralies, but i took this information directly from the parc jean-drapeau master plan.
this is the third kid who died in an episode of violence this year.

more overbidders from ontario, yay
nah, stay away unless you plan to live here right away. we don’t need more non-locals driving up the price of living because it’s “so much cheaper than toronto!”. 
be prepared, i don’t think you’ll find very welcoming answers from folks here in our current housing crisis.
don't, we can 't even afford to buy our own properties.
you're planning on buying a condo and what, *someday* moving here? you don't think it's selfish to buy a property that'll lay empty just so you can maybe one day move here?
wow, the hate is strong in this thread. 
the fuck are you people on about? this person wants to buy a condo in our city because they like the city and want to live here. why push them away?
it's not their fault you can't afford a house in your own city.
don't come here and mess up our market. either move or leave our market alone.
did you start practicing your french?
are you really asking for real estate advice on a random city subreddit?
also, lmfao at all the commentors thinking that by yelling at one would be investor they are single handedly solving the housing crisis. keep up the good work!
it's very doable, i know several people who have. either before they themselves moved from elsewhere, in canada or abroad, while they were waiting for pr, or where they plan to retire to but their kids live in it now while in school. given prices, certainly a good idea to have a property increase with the value of where you want to be without getting too deep in speculating. 
keep in mind condo vs co-op condo is a weird thing we have here that's very different to other provinces. condo is copropriété divise, coop is copropriété indivise. avoid the latter until you are ready to live in it yourself (and maybe even then.) 
it really depends what kind of property you're looking for, too. older, more character, better area may come with more expenses and management so might be more interesting once you're living here for yourself. etc.
so much hostility and condescension in this thread…come on guys we’re better than this 😅
havent done it but i know people that have. your real estate agent can do the visit for you. for the mortgage it might get a little trickier, but nothing will stop the financing, as the property is still in canada.
i am currently in the process of buying a condo in montreal. i live on ottawa. what’s your question precisely?
be very careful which building you buy in…
people are haters on this subreddit, mind boggling. but no, i'm from montreal, and i'd probably go visit before buying though, its just an 7hours drive
people are haters on this subreddit, mind boggling. but no, i'm from montreal, and i'd probably go visit before buying though, its just an 7hours drive
hurry up because the real estate market in montreal is hot hot hot! prices will keep going up and there are bidding wars in certain areas. i recommend getting an agent because it's like a second full time job to look at listings, make calls, schedule visits, etc. i just moved into my new condo by the canal lachine and love it. if you can afford condos right on the canal (griffintown or pointe st charles) i highly recommend.
yes, i live in toronto and bought one. i've told all my other investor friends in toronto to start scooping up condos in montreal while the prices are still relatively affordable.
im going to be moving back to montreal in may, is the rent still " so much cheaper "?
word is the rent is starting to be comparible, is that true? looking to move downtown
i plan to buy a condo there so i can live in it and because i like montreal very much. if you got a issue with real estate increasing beyond affordability just know that i also have a issue with that but i can’t do much about it, the market dictate what it’s worth.
do you really think they'll just let it sit empty? 🙄
it would be fun if they invest in their products too… with the proliferation of microphones, which quite a few have a superior product, i wonder how traditional brewers survive
> i wonder how traditional brewers survive
economies of scale = cheaper beer (and also generally lower quality)
> i wonder how traditional brewers survive
a lot of people don't care about the taste. they drink beer since it's cheap and will get them drunk. or they simply enjoy the macro stuff.
it has its place. i like having cheap beer in the fridge if i'm watching the game with friends and we want to just keep drinking while hanging out. i also have a shop near me that specializes in craft beers, and i've spent hundreds of dollars there since it opened in the summer.
by not selling beers $ 5 to $ 12 each
> i wonder how traditional brewers survive
beer consumers are generally among the most stable. you drink what you drank when you were "18" and started drinking. it may be less the case now with microphone fans but generally speaking once you drink a beer it's your beer for life.
the majority of the beer volume remains commercial beer.
they also make sure to buy medium brewers (think of archibald for labatt, brasseur de montréal / trou du diable for molson) and boost their distribution in grocery stores and convenience stores to satisfy the commercial beer drinker who feels a little adventurous or the micro drinker who can't find his little can of big juice at $ 11.
and those who swear by the real mic have their own businesses and make up only a small percentage of drinkers.
molson's old style pilsner is better than 80% of micro beers.
haha that's true ...
i would like to see the cloud of dust when they open the stereo speakers and put the bass to maximum.

are there still restrictions for indoor gatherings in a private home? the holidays are just around the corner.
on the one hand, i agree that we must now learn to live with the covid. on the other hand, i regret that after 2 years we still have not found solutions to our health system. this is the real problem, a few simple increases in icus and we are all screwed up again. my mother is a victim of covid, not directly but certainly one of the excess mortality statistics and it is deplorable.
it's been open for two years already lol
i saw somebody once describe icus like an overclocked computer:   they are operated to run at near capacity always. so whether it’s covid,  or not covid,  it makes me think that we have been tricked.   like what i mean is articles stating “icus are at 90, 100, 110% capacity”.  because actually,  that seems to be part of their design.
the dust must be settled then?
it is, but one covid patient taking up an icu bed for a couple of weeks takes away a lot of potential spaces for patients who would normally spend a few hours to a couple of days there after some surgeries (eg transplants).

my brother had a membership here a few years back. as i understand things, it's a spot with shared tools, workspaces and storage space for your project. you might luck out and meet someone experienced and willing to share their skills with you, or you might not.
woodworking's tons of fun. post a pic of what it is you're trying to recreate and i might have some pointers for you.
someone will be able to help there, but yeah it's not somewhere they'll make it for you. if you're interested in woodworking at all and depending on how complex it is i'd recommend giving it a shot though.
cool, instead of never delivering my package, now they will just never be able to ship it!
i don't understand how they still exist, it's the worst delivery service by far.
i was made to have my cois delivered directly to the post office to force the merchants to use canada post so it does not look good.
i guess they will try to find other customers with amazon which has been doing its own delivery for a few months.
when i was in griffintown i only had a problem with them twice (the funny thing was, i was waving 200 meters from their office). since i am in the 2nd ring on the south shore, i have a great service. my packages often arrive earlier.
in less dense neighborhoods like the east of the island, i would say that intelcom is not bad without fault. notification a few hours before they pass, a photo where they left my package, i like it!
but when i lived in rosemont, yes of the damned mustard as a delivery service.
they try at my work, but we refuse them as we need canada-wide and they can’t provide outside the cmas of canada. so we remain with canadapost for now, but they’re annoying to deal with
ah, that explains a lot. i live in the east and i couldn't understand why everyone whined about intelcomm.
yeah me when i dealt with them it was in ahuntsic and they delivered on average 2-3 weeks late. i admit that it's been a good 3 years since i used them not against
the lack of legend hurts me very, very much
great map but for a color blind it's extremely difficult to read. ;)
the darker it is, the stronger the support (in proportion to the vote). plant in green, coderre in orange, holness in purple. the hatched sections are the places where no one is in the majority.
why does coderre have so much support in saint-leonard and montreal nord?
nice card!
which districts are the most extreme in voting for each party?
and do you have the complete list of card data?
walk score.png
the colour scheme you chose is very colourblind unfriendly. i suggest picking blues for coderre or even reds.
what's the story with hollness and the little corner of pierrefonds? does it sound close to jacques bizard?
lol, coderre couldn't even win in the west of the island. sad!
cards like that are trompe oeil! a large area is not necessarily very crowded, if you do not know the densities of your areas it can create erroneous findings! know all!
a map without legend, without orientation, without title, without scale, it is not a map but a coloring page.
coderre even lost île notre-dame ...
what does each small polygon with black borders represent? looks like they come from different sources as some follow the shore and others extend into the river. why?
the colors mean what?
the hatched means what?
very cool. do you have an interactive version where you can zoom in, see streets, percentages, etc?
this map also shows that rivière des prairies and pointe aux trembles are really two different reality and mentality and that it would deserve to be split into two boroughs.
interesting to see that montreal-nord took for coderre
it pisses me off that all the administrations don't give a damn about them
solid green in my area
this map really brings out the cities that left after the mergers. rest in peace, one island one city, you were too beautiful for this world.
yeah it looks like a city state map. in dark green, which has been the most maintained in recent years and in orange, which has been the most abandoned

i was surprised by several stories written this week. pleasantly.
i think it's going to be a great game.
place émilie gamelin is on the list, it makes me doubt the rest
okay ..
the shitting world on all the places in the list, let's see which. we each have our tastes and there are lots of fun places here. precious pink hippos deserve respect ✊! (however, the kondiaronk lookout is not there?)
the only one i agree is the place d'armes. i always have a feeling when i pass by, with the basilica ringing its bells. it's open, it's big, it's beautiful.
place valois? truly? lol it.
i was also thinking that to myself while reading the list. in the end i realized that i just don't like "plaza" and i prefer parks with old trees.
however, it is very original with its fountain which deconstructs the city and flows like a river in the grassy area. the addition of the bar in the summer makes it a place that would be most enjoyable if it weren't also the haunt of drug sellers ... for homeless people, you should know that the place has been welcoming them for hundreds of years, because there has always been a soup kitchen in this place (this is also the origin of the name, a sister who took care of it). an island of tolerance and rare diversity ... which despite its weakness, sometimes, in terms of atmosphere, deserves its place in this top in my opinion.
it is a beautiful little public square.
it lacks a bit of greenery, but it's still good.
i would have done something bigger to occupy the entire intersection to the southeast
homelessness is one thing, but it really is criminal / tort activity that is the problem. it's a place where i don't feel safe.
the place, ok. the crowd a lot less. there's a homeless camp in the winter at the north corner of the bistro terrace, and it smells like urine a lot early in the summer - it hurts a lot hochlag '....

second home ;)
> in montréal, feeding wild animals is strictly prohibited so that they don’t become accustomed to humans and lose their independence.
it's too late for these racoons all the tourist feed them. every time i go there there's at least 20 racoons all around looking for food and there not shy about it. funny how it's ok to put cat shelter and cat food in an alley on the plateau but feeding racoons is wrong.
imo that lady must be very lonely so let her be or be nice to her but don't you dare call the cops.
a friend spoke to this lady some time ago, she is nicknamed "the racoon lady". she's been there for years, she says they all have names, but only 5 are hers and she lives with those 5. she's still there a lot. but the raccoons, they are still there!
that's a big nope. totally forbidden.
it’s not legal but it’s like the 10th generation of trash panda that live like that so i wouldn’t be impressed to learn that this place is where they find 90% of their calories
no one's coming around judging you on how you make friends you know
the woman on the picture tonight took couple of raccoon's in her arms and hugged them and pet them. i was shocked how comfortable she was with them. as you can next to her on the picture, she had a big bucket with food inside she gave to them.
people who do this are turning wild animals into pets who will no longer be able to fend for themselves for ever be dependent on humand, who, in the absence of humans, will just end up dying.
if you really love animals, **leave them alone and observe them from afar.**
these are big raccoons!
at most they would get a fine, but it's neither legal nor ok
this is illegal.
she must be stop, because the raccoon around there will become more acclimate to us and it can become a very big problem in the future ; they will expect we will give them foods at any time they would cross our path and if we not comply, it can create hostile reactions from them toward us.
feeding wildlife of any species is a bad thing.
they will start approaching everybody expecting the same result.
they could hurt somebody or be hurt/killed by someone who isn't as comfortable with them.
bad move all around.
plus, it's prohibited for that reason.
not legal but many people feel very lonely and feed urban animals to cope, fining them would seem very unjust.
no it's not, we all remember this infamous rant about feeding the squirrels 
man some people are just … so lonely 🙃
they carry diseases such as rabies, illegal or not .. i do not recommend it at all!
racoons have rabbies... stay away
nope, but people still do them anyway cause they think they are being cute
this is how you catch rabies.
super sore loser. a week before the election, on her show, julie snyder asked him in an interview, if he would remain as leader of the opposition, and he did not answer the question clearly, but made believe so. he's a through and through liar. in addition, he blames others for his defeat and for the "dirty campaign" while it is he who acted in a dirty and disrespectful way. good riddance!!!

disgusted by everyone.
because of the way this big baby acted after the vote, i regret voting for him :(
among those people who voted plante, i think its fair to say some voted for plante, and some voted against coderre.
among those people who voted coderre, i think they almost universally were voting against plante. 
so firstly good riddance to coderre (side note; i personally think its a huge conflict-of-interest issue that so many politicians go straight from public office to lobbyist), but secondly plante should be careful, in that somewhere around 40% of the people who bothered to cast a ballot voted against her; imagine if someone competent, qualified and likeable had run against her...
no need, go to the convenience store and ask for a cardboard box, it will be as strong as its fortresses.
gnd / manon majority!
he was kind of acting like a big baby before the vote too...
so you voted for the big baby because of the way he acted before the vote?
coderre announcing his run at becoming a mayor had to have annoyed many voters who dislike plante. i get that there are many who do not like her agenda. coderre was never going to be the person to beat her.  he effectively ruined any chance of someone else beating plante. in a way, coderre ensured four more years of new bike lanes!
  us leftist pinkos from le plateau should really be thanking denis !
>  i personally think its a huge conflict-of-interest issue that so many politicians go straight from public office to lobbyist
just fyi, lobbying in canada is not like lobbying in the usa.
here, to be allowed to do lobbying activities, you have to be registered and the process requires that you disclose pretty much everything of relevance, and then that information is available to the public. here's the requirements in french:
> if you are completing a declaration as a consultant lobbyist:
> if you have held a public office, the nature and duration of this office;
> the name of your clients, if they receive funding from a government or a municipality, the name of the latter and the amounts received;
> the name and address of the parent company of your clients as well as those of their subsidiaries interested in the outcome of the lobbying activity, if applicable;
> you will be asked for a description of your mandates. to help you, examples illustrate the required mentions in bulletin 2004-03 and will be displayed to you at the appropriate time in the form;
> the start date of the mandate must be the date of the first activity with the public office holder;
> the name of the institutions with which you will communicate within the framework of the mandate and the means of communication used.

if you really want to rub salt in the wound, you could take up a collection to buy coderre a bike. you could even throw in one of those cellphone holders for the handlebars seeing as apparently road safety laws dont apply to (self-)important people like him.
sure, but thats not the problem. this is: lets say im a politician. part of the job of government is to regulate certain industries. now some of those regulations are good for society at large, but detrimental to those industries. environmental and labour norms come to mind immediately. how hard am i, as a politician, going to push to advance those sorts of laws, knowing that i want you to hire me as a lobbyist once i leave elected office?
you could even see it as an act of corruption with a differed payout; i will slow-walk and obstruct new regulations as much as i can get away with, and in exchange your company will hire me for an exorbitant salary in 10 years time...
hello, can i take your order?
rosemont: even along bellechasse, there are only two offices that are red. i am surprised by the quantity of ensemble montréal signs there.
vsmpe: st-michel and parc-extension are blood red. yet these are two districts that would benefit greatly from progressive pm policies. hypotheses?
outremont: mass vote against tomlinson because of the vignettes?
wow super interesting!! i worked as a scrutatrice for the election and it’s cool seeing the numbers i counted shown here! 
out of curiosity, where did you get this count info specifically for each box?
ahahaha. poor balarama.
how is this sorted i assume through polling station numbers ?
you need better data. lasalle voted for their own party, not for plante or coderre.
i was told the bike lanes are not wanted by the locals, but it looks like it is wrong.
the spreadsheet is now available from the city’s open data portal: 
yes, the numbers are ballot box numbers (“section de vote” in french). the first set of three digits are the district and the second set are the ballot box within the district as far as i know. note that this map doesn’t include any early voting.
these are just the results for the mayor of montreal election… borough mayors, borough and city councillor maps are coming soon :)
its votes for the mayor of montreal only, since lasalle’s team didnt have a candidate for mayor of mtl they had the same choices as the other boroughs. 
i was also confused at first glance.
cool, thanks!!
we keep going, their smash burger is the best in town. i love their small menu, packed with flavors. too bad they dispute the measures (vaccination passport), we can no longer eat there
i would go there just for the loco moco 😍
[deleted]
the hawaiian is weak but unfortunately the best in town
and the owners refuse to enforce the vaccine passport, so they’re takeout/delivery only now. massive props to them—i’ve been ordering from them a bunch to show my support! tasty ass food made by people with principles; now *that’s* a restaurant worthy of my patronage!
their smash burger is great! as a filipino, the first time i tried it i was surprised it had atchara (papaya pickles). gave me a good laugh but then i realized it was original and really good lol.
oh they dispute ?? it makes me want aha
being anti-vaccine passports doesn't automatically equate with being an antivax. je dis ça, je dis rien...
we confirm the username
that pickled garnish is tasty!
i'm looking at their menu, but i can't find the smash burger.
how much is it and what does it comes with?
they had a post where it was mentioned before but i couldn't find it
"i got it!
at the place versailles
of me and promise
at the place versailles "
the northeast parking lot is practically empty, you might as well use it.
it should be a long time since mixed developments have existed all over the island, it is high time that it started.
offices / shops at street level, houses above. all done in a way that you can have virtually everything within walking distance, or even without even having to go outside. it would make a lot more sense than to separate everything as they are doing now by forcing people to travel by some means of transport regardless of whether they are going to shop or work, because nothing is really close.
be careful, this is a historic place: 
[deleted]
at place versailles! 🎶
except that it is stuck on the 25 too. a beautiful condo with a view of the 25 and its service roads?
exactly, especially around the subways.
they do this in wall-e too.
they are already doing it in toronto (yorkdale) and in the west island (fairview), in my opinion i prefer to have “transit oriented developments” with access to the rem than fucking parking lots everywhere.
we must make a tidy office / commercial on the side of the 25 and the condos after.
yes take my 550,000 for a condo esti with cardboard walls please!
what's stupid is that the next rem won't go through there, even if it could. the district has proposed an improved trace, it remains to be seen if this will be accepted.
that's what cities skylines taught me too!
fully agree!
550,000 for a 3 1/2, 500sqft, optional garage at 70k.
it's not crazy in itself to want to do real estate, there is space around and we can always work on the landscaped shutter to hide a little the 25, but if these people are interested in real estate today it is certainly not just for the pleasure of offering montrealers a roof over their heads.
tse, when journalists do it on purpose to mess around. what is the report of the passage on the cycle path? it's been what, 20 years since there is a track there? 30 years? why put that there?
it was impossible to say which institution in the title? the clickbait is no.
good riddance. it was a beautiful gang of silly air. i went there often and there was never anything and the staff were extremely incompetent and rude.
especially since it comes from a problem between the shareholders.
to make you react.
yeah i was like wtf ... they must be running out of words for the article so they pick up an old story.
having lived near my birth to this year (21) and having passed by by bike very often, the cycle path has always been an issue. a woman on a bicycle has already been run over by a truck just in front. it was dangerous and, unfortunately, a lumber yard had less or less its place in such a dense and family neighborhood, which, yes, travels a lot by bike.
** the bmr on rue saint-zotique is closed. **
i even kept the typo of the article.
i agree with buying local (bmr, home-hardware vs big american banners) but similarly the little bmr in my neighborhood the employees don't give a damn and don't want to shop there.
* vat new kicks in *
> a lumber yard had less or less its place in such a dense and family-oriented neighborhood, which, yes, travels a lot by bicycle.
i have mixed feelings. the bmr still offered an essential service to this neighborhood (not just wood) and now residents have no other choice but to go to american banners much further. if we would prefer that people no longer have cars, it takes a city with the most services available nearby.
there remains the villeneuve lumber yard at the corner of bellechasse / st-laurent, but this one is also surrounded by cycle paths.
lol so nobody ever does projects in those areas now or needs an urgent repair item? ok
i’m not blaming a cycle path for their demise but lumber yards and hardware stores are essential to any area. especially smaller family run stores where staff is knowledgeable and knows where everything is
what typo?
don't forget the home depot in beaubien. in the article he mentions that the bmr did not offer other products than to make the rough.
> we were alone in our niche which is the rough of the renovation. there is no decoration, no seasonal product, no tools. we used to say to customers: once you put up walls and put your drywall in, you don't come here anymore. for the rest, you go elsewhere. "
i agree with you in terms of local services, but a large load of wood, people did not really come to look for it on foot ... the difference with villeneuve is that there is more parking. large and fenced where people can load their tanks. at bmr this space is blurry and often encroached on the sidewalk and the bike path, forcing cyclists to bypass trucks.
there's 2 literally 10 minutes from the one that closed.
i agree that these businesses are essential, but you have to know where to locate them. a lumber yard that opens directly onto a purely residential street with a cycle path is more viable. it is not the hardware store that is the problem, it is the lumber yard which generates a lot of truck movements. don't worry, there are still places where you can buy equipment in the area, but indeed you have to go further and further for the big pieces.

he said he would stick around as opposition leader this time, always full of shit.
unless i'm mistaken, he still hasn't said the words: "congratulations to valérie plante for her victory".
it's all the same for such a proud man. he is still blaming the media or his opponents or whatever instead of saying well done and actually moving on.
shit attitude.
edit: error on my part, he quickly said bravo at the beginning of his speech before launching into his usual nonsense.
i quit 2, electric boogaloo
hope it's true this time around!
comp is try
denis coderre never wanted to serve the community, all he wanted was to serve himself.
k. bye.
he left to concentrate on his next book: reretrouver montreal.
* “i love them,” he said. “it's an extraordinary book that ends, but with this experience, i can do a lot of other things, \ [… \] both internationally, locally or elsewhere. "*
my french isn't the best, trying to understand what could be *ailleurs* in this case. if not local nor international, where then?
word of a friend: "denis coderre who announces his withdrawal from political life, it's like broue who announces his last tour."
womp womp.
edit: i'm coming to dislike politicians with increasing intensity the older i get. but mr. coderre is at another level - the very sight of him, especially in those stupid fucking glasses he's adopted to hip himself up, makes me want to go vote against him all over again. he didn't deserve to govern and i'm beyond glad he lost. hopefully he can pack up that ridiculously oversized ego of his and find a dumber electorate far from here to try and swindle.
he actually promised he wouldn't do like last time and would stick around. so much for that pledge.
unless of course the polls are in favor of a return to 2025 ...
yes please. and dark in oblivion
remindme! 40 months
haha!
my 2nd to last parting gift for him, was a vote not for him. 
my last parting wishes for him... is: 
#>!╭∩╮ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ╭∩╮!<
what a little man with an ego as heavy as a block of cement.
there are plenty of positions in the cas of large companies for political has-beens. he's gonna be okay.
i could see it being at transcontinental telling us that the publi-sac are still essential.
/s
denis coderre wants power or win.
if he loses he quits !! he's a sore loser, lucky he wasn't elected. if he had the best interests of montrealers at heart, he would have remained in the opposition to debate and defend his point. but no… he leaves for the nth time. it is a pure opportunist in my opinion !! chow bye bad loser 👋

montreal newspaper? oh boy ...
a quality journalistic article offered by jdm
it's literally just an ad from ivanhoe, "remember our overpriced food court? it has a fancy new ceiling now."
is it a new point of view installed by the municipal administration?
that makes me happy.
about time ...
the logic: we pile up on top of each other in closed metro cars but we can't let someone play the violin in huge corridors.
awesome! i miss boat-guy, and the old man with the accordion, the wailing lady, and all the other regulars
wow, did anyone else completely forget that there were ever musicians in the metro? feeling geriatric right now.
it was never really unsafe if you think about it. less safe than riding on the actual metro itself? can't see how that's any more safe than a musician who by choice wants to be in his corner away from people playing music to our ears. should be the musicians choice cause it's none other than their own safety at worst
''like customers and staff, musicians performing in metro stations will be required to wear masks unless they’re playing a wind instrument'' .
yet another absurdity in the era of covidian cultism .''breathing? mask up! playing jazz flute? spit a phat beat my good fellow!'' 
i hope people will begin to remove their masks when they see more of these logical juxtapositions.
i wish the dancing spiderman back who hisses when he throws his invisible webs.
a yes, i can not wait to start again to say to a musician so the music will sound bad no matter how talented it is because of the listening of the metro stations that it has been years that i drag more changes on me.
if there are people who really want to make music there, fine for them, but it seems to me that the concept itself is not great.
which is ridiculous.
clark & marcy too! (the guy with the stand up bass, whose name is marcy)
not thaaaatt eager for wailing lady (and any wailing people for that matter), but i will be happy to see the others yeah.
i moved here mid pandemic. no idea that was a thing. do they need permits?
"the stm is trying to gradually and safely reduce covid restrictions and letting some not have masks on! yet more absurd covid cultism! i hope people will be able to take their masks off again soon!"
it sounds like people gradually being able to be in the metro like normal is exactly what you want, why are you so upset?
this "logical juxtaposition" is one among a series of compromises made between limiting transmission of covid-19 and other aspects of life. a wind instrument probably increases the chances of transmission but if the overall impact of covid-19 remains stable or trends downward it could be a reasonable risk to take. but i hear where you're coming from, the inconsistencies can be frustrating.
i hope people remove their masks when it is safe to do so. i hope people respect themselves and one another enough to work together against this disease.
>"breathing? mask up! playing jazz flute? spit a phat beat my good fellow!"
don't forget "breathing? mask up! having a smoke? kill us all!"
out in front of the indigo i think?
i am a musician and i have several friends who do this purely for fun / to practice performing in front of people. i hope you don't interrupt all the musicians you meet in the metro in the middle of a room just to tell them that you have no change on you. money is never refusal but that's not necessarily the reason why artists do it.
also, the acoustics are not bad in themselves, it's just very reverberated but it's no different from performing in a church for example, there are a lot of musical aesthetics that lend to that.
no one is forcing you to talk to them.
headphones exist.
the store where i work has tons of copies, you should drop by. ;)
the same goes for leisure musical activities (orchestral ensemble made up of adult amateurs). they are still limited to 25 people max per set (even if the sets often have 50-60 players), in mandatory distance of 2m, because it is really dangerous as an activity. on the other hand, once the rehearsal is over, everyone can go out for a beer, dance, and do karaoke until the early hours of the morning. it is 100% absurd.
carbone boréal! uqac initiative, best solution in quebec in my opinion.
you can give me the money and i’ll deal with this and make the city better
i second this!
denis, is that you?
talk to ottawa ...
i read "india" ... and i stopped there. that largely explains the problem.
i have an indian colleague in canada for 20-30 years and who still have family there. we were just talking yesterday about bringing stuff from india. he never told me in life. there is too much corruption and fraud in the factories.
underpaid employees. poor working conditions. it gives exactly that ... a questionable quality.
if you pay bananas, you get monkeys.
[the original electric locomotives on this line were in service from 1918 to 1995, or ~ 77 years.] (
i have a feeling that the new trains may not last that long.
i have been saying this from the start: an instruction should have been added to the contract dictating a high% quebec content for all suppliers and subcontractors, as we had done for wind turbines, for example.
i even remember writing a long post about it a few years ago, saying that the discounts that come with the "out-sourced" model are actually paid for in reduced quality on the finished product and in human misery for these. foreign workers (working conditions leading to these choices, fewer health & safety rules there, etc.)
yes, it would have cost more if it had been done in quebec, but employee salaries would have been directly taxed here and the local and regional benefits would have been significant.
that's kind of the problem when you give public service projects to organizations motivated by profit ...
not shocking first units will always have issues
wow! anyone surprised?
it is so much plq as the conclusion of a poorly conducted file from the start.
qqn is surprised?
eh??!! so let's see ... yet india is recognized for its assembly and exemplary finish of their products ... / s

"the manufacturer, who bears the cost of the fixes, argues that it is precisely the purpose of the tests to modify or correct elements."
cibole, imagine if we hadn't had them checked.
alstom is crap. watch lrt in ottawa. nothing but problems
it is probably just implying delays and thus higher cost.
sounds almost normal to me for new projects of this scale, i mean to be expected and acceptable in a sense.
they could have bought the high speed train know-how from trains in france, italy or china i guess... still then a *lot* of money and jobs would have moved outside the country!?
literally no different than what bombardier does
* surprised pikatchu *
workers are paid $ 2 / hr in india according to the article. no surprise that if you use cheap labor that you are going to have a cheap result. this project has been a disaster from the start.
the same company makes both systems ... what a surprise.
it's a matter of cutting prices to maximize profits. light rail in ottawa suffers from problems, as well as those in washington.
yeah: made in india, china, taiwan ... let's say ...
like
bombardier junk would be any better
i get what you’re saying, but don’t love that expression.
trains are also rebuilt several times over their life span… i don’t get what’s so alarmist about the train sets. it’s pretty normal stuff to have a corrections list
> won reelection after reclaiming 22,000 sq meters of vehicle lanes to create **38 neighbourhood plazas** over three years...this citywide reordering of streets put **half of milan’s 1.35 million residents within walking distance of new public space**. the measures were strongly opposed by some residents concerned about the loss of parking and driving space, but **milanese voters ultimately rewarded sala with 56% of the vote**.
this is one of the things that's often lost in the "bike lane" debate. so much of pro-bike/pedestrian infrastructure comes with massive improvements to the communities, aside from just the bike lanes themselves. 
cars take up way, way too much space and every time my neighbourhood reclaims some of that space, my quality of life goes up.
>next month, the mayors of two cities in north america – mike duggan in detroit and valérie plante in montreal – will test whether voters reward their pedestrian and bike-friendly policies.  
>  
>\[...\]  
>  
>plante’s path to reelection in montreal on 7 november is being challenged by denis coderre, who has criticised her bike- and pedestrian-friendly policies. critics have portrayed plante as out of touch with ordinary residents, but even her opponent is careful to promise that he would not reverse her signature protected bike lane on st denis street.bikelash can be exhaustingly repetitive, to the point where even media writers are tired of the ritual of discussing bike lanes solely in terms of controversy.reflecting on a decade of bike controversies across canada, toronto’s the globe and mail this month asked: “is the war against bike lanes finally over?”perhaps not quite yet, but the editorial took the view that bike lanes had “grown from political flashpoints – and ideological signifiers – to standard-issue civic infrastructure”.it added: “the arguments over bike lanes are settled. they’re becoming what they should have long been: an ordinary way of getting around our cities.”they are also an increasingly ordinary way for mayors to win elections.
we know how it went now!
and in detroit, mike duggan got 75% of the vote.
before, it frustrated motorists to have to stop at a crosswalk. now that's pretty much the norm. people understand: those who want to cross safely are their neighbors, their children, their friends, themselves.
the same thing will happen with cycling, you just have to push this culture to make it happen faster!
this is because the rabid people are those who pass through the neighborhood, while those who vote are those who live there. between a road with widened sidewalks, a cycle path and a voice for cars, and a 3-lane street, the choice is quickly made. better safety, less noise, visual and atmospheric pollution, it's just better.
it feels like the “debate” is usually centred around people who aren’t even in these communities in the first place.  in my experience the people with the biggest complaints rarely live in the city centres or neighbourhoods anyway. they’re commuters who want the infrastructure they don’t even pay taxes for to accommodate them first and foremost.
the summer long pedestrianisation of wellington st in verdun was incredible.
it's also getting more and more inconvenient to drive around in a city. personally, i don't want us ending up like new york city, so the more we discourage drivers and the more we encourage cycling and public transport, the more pleasant my drive is when i *really* need to drive somewhere.
yes!!! one thing i always bring up is—can you honestly tell me that you don’t think st-denis is so much more beautiful and pleasant now?! i would loooooooove if the whole city was as nice as st-denis is! it’s such a pleasure.
> critics have portrayed plante as out of touch with ordinary residents
people on bicycles, as we know, are rather extraordinary residents !!!
i once had a lady congratulate me for stopping at the zebra crossing.
it makes me happy, it's the law lol
"i don't want those people to improve their quality of life with their own money they pay in taxes because i want to be able to park right in front of the restaurant where i go once a month with my family. if they go forward they will lose my business."
> it feels like the “debate” is usually centred around people who aren’t even in these communities in the first place.
absolutely!
the amount of times i've had this conversation and eventually the person said "and that's why i'll never move to the city!". motherfucker you don't even live here?!?!
> they’re commuters who want the infrastructure they don’t even pay taxes for to accommodate them first and foremost.
exactly. and i honestly think there's an element of envy or fomo or something as well. the anger doesn't really make sense to me otherwise. it's like they're projecting what they hope living in a city is like, because they don't want to feel bad they don't live here.
what's especially interesting is that suburbanites are [plenty happy to restrict cars in their own neighbourhoods]( (with cul-de-sacs, etc.). it's unfortunate that some suburbanites don't think people in urban areas have the same right.
*angry boomers who live in the suburbs*, meanwhile people like us, who live in the affected boroughs enjoy having *liveable* neighborhoods.
this came to test with winnipeg's main & portage referendum.  
winnipeg's [main intersection]( has been barred to pedestrians for decades. pedestrians have to use an underground crossing that's very confusing and uncomfortable, and 3 years ago the mayor ran a referendum to see if winnipeggers want the intersection closed or open to pedestrians.  
if i remember correctly opening would have added at most a couple minutes to everyone's daily commute.  
the no ended up winning, and you can see [here]( the vote map. i'll let you guess where that intersection is located.
that's way too true. looking at people complaining on facebook about montreal's bike paths, they don't even live on the island. it's just an older crowd that lives 30 minutes outside of the city.
yeah, same thing with mont royal for me. it's a game changer for the whole neighbourhood. i'm really hoping we keep it post covid.
on the flipside, what frustrates me to no end is when a pedestrian is at a designated crosswalk just standing there like an idiot waiting for a gap in the passing cars. it's a crosswalk! you have priority! just fucking cross the street! 
thank you for coming to my ted talk /rant
100% lol
yup. live in plateau. if you ever see someone driving like a dickhead with a bumblebee up their ass, it's gonna be someone without a resident decal\* lol. they're the ones who are mad the neighbourhood is a "maze" (traffic diversion/calming features) and that non-metered parking is hard to find. i think most residents appreciate these features.
\*could be a resident who has off-street parking or who is a wizard at finding the unregulated spots, but more likely to be from an outlying neighbourhood/suburb
good. sports can pay for themselves and stay out of the city's coffers.
if the stadium construction project was so profitable, as its many supporters claim, why no private consortium wants to raise the funds to build it?
in addition to the fact that publicly paying for a stadium and a private team is stupid, it is even more so for baseball, a sport that is losing popularity across north america.
> bronfman is the big boss, but he'll need help “selling” the return of baseball to the public. until now, he has been working in opacity. its rare public outings, full of enthusiasm, are poor in information. it's great that there is work being done behind the scenes. but if citizens have the impression that we want to ram a concept conceived behind closed doors down their throats, which currently seems to be the case, the backlash will be lasting.
we don't need to be convinced. putting a dime of public money or a square metre of public land is a bad idea which just needs to go away.
i’ll take a basketball team.
not a personal fan of bball, but the footprint would be minuscule, and based on how well raptors games sell out when they are at the bell centre, i think there is actually a following here that would allow for the creation of jobs, tourism, cultural (like the impacts) growth, and all kinds of goodies.
vote me for mayor, i promise a basketball team, a purple line, to fix our streets, fix healthcare (by paying the workers what they actually deserve) and make sure teachers are well paid too.
these boring baseball, i am not saying that another sport could not become popular in quebec, but we have already tried and the interest is not there.
as has been studied all over na. tax money is lost if given to fund stadiums. the rich have gotten richer over time. let them pay.
first rule of business: never risk your own money
i would tell you that it's a matter of egg or chicken: you don't want to pay for the stadium (especially baseball because cat is not used for much else) before having a guarantee of having a team and a team (or new franchise) will not come to a city without the guarantee of having a stadium to settle in.
a beautiful game of chicken where quebec has already lost.
have you seen the financial package and the demand from the group of investors? exactly. we're talking for nothing at the moment. let's wait and see what the request is.
profitability studies are always prepared by the same firms. worse, we get along that i can't see them saying no, it's not good for their customers.
> i would tell you that it's a matter of egg or chicken: you don't want to pay for the stadium (especially baseball because cat is not used for much else) before having a guarantee of having a team and a team (or new franchise) will not come to settle in a city without the guarantee of having a stadium in which to settle.
we have a crack! me this is the end that does not come back to me. if the current baseball stadium isn't right for you, fuck it.
calms you.
we have been talking about this project for more than 5 years. without public investment, it is clear that this project is going nowhere, so i conclude that this project is obviously not profitable. you have to be a blessed yes yes to economic liberalism to think otherwise.
we don't have a baseball stadium, we have an olympic stadium that can be adapted for multisport. the yankees and red sox played at london stadium, that doesn't make it a baseball stadium.
> fuck it.
super mature as a way to chat.
> we don't have a baseball stadium, we have an olympic stadium that can be adapted for multisport.
the exhibitions played there for years. building a new stadium is a waste.
>> fuck it.
>
> super mature as a way of discussing.
no, but we send them politely. the important thing is not to put a cent in a new stadium.
> the exhibitions played there for years. building a new stadium is a waste.
and all the players / coaches said it wasn't for playing baseball. andré dawson left because his knees couldn't take the concrete anymore. it is not a baseball infrastructure. i repeat that several matches have been played in soccer / football stadiums, that does not make them baseball stadiums.
> the important thing is not to put a cent in a new stadium.
where did i say the opposite?
r/walmartcelebrities christiano ronaldo
he looks exactly the kind of person to do something like that 
the fact that his name is brayden is the cherry on top
it's annoying articles that give almost no information. random attack, link to organized crime or ...?
innocent until proven guilty.
in the meantime though, this particular suspect is most certainly guilty of looking like an insufferable douche, with a douchey pout on his petulant punum, a fake-n-bake tan, a douchey coiffe and an especially douchey name.
this is not the purpose of this article. they just want help from the public to find a wanted man.
these government bonuses the doctors have donated to match are too dependent on never calling in sick, taking a leave of absence, or going part time.  most of the bonus money is completely lost once you miss a day of full time work, even for normally acceptable reasons.  i have no perfect solution, but paying a higher rate + higher overtime rate may get more shifts staffed in the short term.
just my 2 cents as a nurse who left the public hospital side.
this is frustrating
let's be honest, 90 000$ between 90 doctors over two years is not going to hurt anyone. it's not a very selfless act.
also. doctors are part owners of their departments. i have a hard time explaining it but since they are mostly all incorporated, they are not really employees. this isn't coming out of their pockets, it is coming out of their bonus.
they usually have the final say on budget, projects and hiring. so, the fact they are taking 90k out of their bonuses to increase the employment conditions of their team kinda seems like the average normal move.
let's remember that those doctors make way more than 90k a year. that for one of their salaries they could have that money. 
what they tell you and what is, never the same. this is why i left the healthcare system, i hate being so blatantly manipulated.
doctors in the er are independent practitioners separate from the hospital and should not be held accountable for the rest of hospital funding.  however, an er doctor easily makes >5x what an er nurse does, despite not having 5x the years of education.  
not saying they should not be making their well deserved salary.  i just think nurse salaries have to go up too if we want people to work these jobs.
disclaimer : this isn't the case everywhere i am aware but i know it is the case at many clinics.
doctors do make amazing salaries, that they deserve and more because most of them work 60-80 hour weeks especially when you account for training, networking and on call time.
but, they make more than they say. they have their regular salary, and they make a bonus depending on how much is left in the budget at the end of the year.
every medical activity has two fees, administrative and for their pay. the clinic/hospital gets the administration fee, but at the end of the year, what's left over is their bonus. 
this is why staff can't ask for a raise. this is why they don't buy new chairs, or invest in the lighting. because every cost cut becomes a bigger bonus for them. and honestly, it's an incentive. again doctors are underpaid in quebec so it's a huge advantage to have this kind of bonus. but it's also a mess. 
i could go on but let's just say, doctors should just be employees. what's wrong with paying someone 150$ an hour when they deserve it?
fuck yes! 
it's been years that the land has been vacant, the book store is upgrading! and not far from my home too !!
they didn't choose their name how to make love to a negro without getting tired? weird ...
it's also super interesting to install it on the border of the two arrondissements! we need one at the junction of rosemont, mercier and saint-léonard too (like at the corner of viau and beaubien)!
> how to make love to a negro without getting tired?
hmmm, you're not correct, now you have to call the book: "how to make love with an n word without getting tired?"
edit:  /s
> they didn't choose their name how to make love to a name in n without getting tired? weird ...
ftfy
it becomes abstract ... interesting!
there is nothing there justin trudeau is mp for papineau and he lives on another planet

unfortunately, even in countries where it is compulsory to live where one candidate to represent the elections, the politicians just take rent to comply.
bein voyonn doknnc
it is normal, there is no parking, fa that will live there elsewhere 😁
you, do you work in your borough?
> even in countries where it is compulsory to live where you are a candidate to represent the elections, the politicians just charge rent to comply
so regulate that too. surely this is a solvable problem (if we agree as a society that it's a problem).
you
not the same ... he is an elected official
elected, it is not a job, it is a mandate of representation.
like most people, i have the choice of living in the neighborhood where i work for only the average amount of negative income, or living remote where there are rents that i can afford.
(actually it's wrong, the permanent wfh fixed this, but i've done decades in the higher situation.)
this is much more complex than it seems. résidence principale is a concept that is blurry and needs to stay so in order to accomodate people travelling long term, people without a regular place to live, people moving temporarly for a job or to help a relative, etc. etc.   
make it too strict and you put a lot of people in trouble
lol!!
i know, but i'm just curious.
also, there is a difference between an elected official who is present in a district where he does not live, vs an elected official who has moved to live elsewhere in mid-term, say.
flashback of the orange wave; when ruth ellen brosseau got elected in mauricie (if i'm not mistaken) she didn't even know the area ... that's not acceptable.
>  the vegetarian brosseau knew nothing about politics or the riding, with many pork and beef farmers, and a travel time of three-and-one-half hours away from her ottawa home by car.[14][15] she did not expect to win,[16] did not campaign, and never went to the riding, which straddles lanaudière and mauricie.
a very special case
makes no sense la ... come on. it's even a job criss, and the salary is blah. if anything else than a job ... c'tune vocation.
with politicians, it is exactly the opposite that we observe. they present themselves in working-class neighborhoods but live in neighborhoods in high demand.
> this is much more complex than it seems.
it's definitely more complex than just saying "regulate it" i agree, but i think we overcomplicate things because we're wary of being "unfair" to people like politicians. it's not unfair for us to ask that they disclose all their residences and that they have to prove which one they live in primarily. 
> to accomodate people travelling long term, people without a regular place to live, people moving temporarly for a job or to help a relative, etc. etc.
none of that applies here though. and even if it did, it's not hard to carve out temporary exemptions for things. we're talking about for politicians specifically, it's ok to ask that they adhere to some pretty basic rules that normal people don't have to.
it is indeed a special case, but we really cannot blame him for the rest of the matter. she was 100% invested in her work, ended up marrying a local pork producer and still lives there today.
> also, there is a difference between an elected official who is present in a district where he does not live, vs an elected official who has moved to live elsewhere in mid-term, say.
right, some have lived in the borough most of their lives and then moved not so long ago.
the nice intellectual shortcut to your thing: is vegetarian, so she will understand nothing or do anything for the farmers / eyeroll
the great seduction!
acab women = rev
my god, i did not know that the rev had such a marked political scope
“later, two students received emails about the morning's events from their individual teaching assistants (apis). they were jeanne and laurie-ève *. the latter had not intervened in class, but it would appear that the teacher confused her with laeticia. both have black skin. "
me.
[i do not seek yourself] (
defending your right to say a racist term while in a position of authority and mentorship is the saddest hill to die on.
how many times are we going to repost the same article with no new information or version from the other party?
hey wokes, you know the movie "how to have sex with a nigger without getting tired" still exists ?!
oh yes, dany laferrière scenario.
in a "provocative" tone ahahahaha
there is the reaction of the collège de maisonneuve in the article and i took the time to check if it had already been posted.
yes and unlike you, we read the novel.
\ - the wokes
the woke in this case is clearly the teacher trying to censor the opinion of her students by taking them out of class, right?
she repeated it 25 times, if it is not provocation i wonder what it is.
super glad that some can read. at least all is not lost.
now pass on your knowledge of the book. because some people only saw the movie. ;))
yes i totally agree :)
the teachers are seriously exhausted. that doesn't excuse what she did, but that at least partly explains the slippage i have the impression. my young in sec. 2 told me this week that a teacher has forbidden to speak about the independence of quebec in a writing work which was to relate to something like "how do you see your future?".
one student asked if this was a possible topic, another said he too would like to write about it (even some sort of science fiction), there was a little buzz and she declared the topic banned . we would never have seen that before, prohibiting from the outset a theme that does not prejudice anyone; torieu! there is a sovereignist political party in quebec and another in ottawa, it's not as if they were terrorist ideas or a call for revolution either!
but here it looks like the cup is still on the verge of overflowing. it makes you wonder if part of the culture of banishment could not also be understood through this prism of acute disgust. like: we no longer want to debate or even deal with divergent points of view, we are just tired.
and while we're at it, you will tell mathieu-bock côté, richard martineau, sophie durocher, gilles proulx and denise bombardier who are already sharpening their pencils that we know very well the difference between saying a word. in its academic context and repeat it 25 times out of pure provocation.
\ - the wokes
i do see the point of the teacher though. "how do you see your future?" and "how do you see the future of your country/canada/quebec?" are different topics. it should be how you see the trajectory of your life. i think if a student was to go on those thematic then he would be off-topic.
i stay away from the aforementioned characters.
i do not think so. why can't a young person write "i see myself as a politician / minister / etc. from a country called quebec?" there is nothing dangerous in there, one, and two, i turn it all over all sides and can't see how we can censor young people, unless they call for violence.
my favorite park!!! im so sad i hope its going to be salvageable…. :(
fuck! that's some of my childhood, going up in smoke, right there..  
best swings ever, in that park, easily 10' chains.  
felt like you could make leo at the top of the arc.
i confused it with parc outremont now that's the chalet that needs to go up in smoke. geez, those washrooms haven't been renovated since ww2.
a follow?
lacerte is not always recommendable, but he has been signaling that outremont's elected officials do not take care of the parks for a long time and let the buildings go to the devil. lately he pointed out the great poverty of the chalet in outremont park. it's really sad to see this in such a wealthy area. i had business in the area a few years ago because my boys' daycare was not far away and we never came back, back in our very middle class + hlm neighborhood, the quality of our parks and public spaces.
whaaaat ! noooo
i hope they will rebuild it identically for the look (but new for the toilets)! it was a unique park building on the island!
oh, man, that's why the area was closed this weekend... i thought it had to do with the canal/lake around the pavillion.
let's just hope there's funds and time to rebuild part of it for the ice skating season and then in spring (latest) to keep the nice activities here going.
loved to watch the dance events in the summer evenings. lived around the area for ages and just realized that this exists in 2021.
favorite park? when you're right next to park outremont? blasphemy! (jk)
and i built floats that went around that pond :(
>  leo
law enforcement officer? that's an aspiration, i guess.
in fact, i wonder if it has ever been renovated. it dates from 1925 and the consultations on its restoration, expansion, etc. are complicated pcq it is a building with heritage value. i'm not saying it's classified, but it has a whole history linked to its architect so you can't do anything and often not do anything = unfortunately do nothing at all ... details here on what is planned: 
[removed]
around noon. we don't see much. the park is cordoned off. 
lacerte not always recommendable? tell me more if you want to.
low earth orbit
thank you for the link. wow, i was not far away. it needs a lot of work. it was pretty gross when i was there this summer. the interior of a bathroom should not be heritage, change the sink and toilet at least. lol
well let's say that his "photo-novels" are sometimes bordering on bad taste. so we certainly do not win the reader's sympathy by varying all the time on the same nail.
i know.
> the interior of a bathroom should not be heritage
well if it was simply restored to its original state, it would still be taken! i would have nothing against for my part that we find there p. ex. copper, small mosaic ceramics like in the vespasiennes of yesteryear, but tse, with more pressure in the flush and a little heating!
maybe he was inspecting the building ? that seems like an expensive drone used by companies.
there was a drone flying between the ghetto and the mcgill sport center wednesday morning, and it was operated by road workers.
looked like that exact drone too.
i know it's probably not you but that big antenna make you look suspect hahaha
in the ghetto??
walk up to the window. naked.
make eye contact with the camera.
masturbate furiously.
that drone was going to a prison for a delivery
better hope they had a drone license, downtown is class c airspace.
why you have windows ?
do you have a slingshot?
use it to take it down.
this is quite obviously a pro drone.
the world doesn't revolve around you, i'd bet money they gave no fucks and were doing building inspection.
this looks like a commercial drone with some kind of a special camera mounted on it — maybe they’re doing thermal imaging of the building?
drone this big definitely requires a licence and permit to fly at a given place and time. if you’re really curious, you can follow up with tcca, they would have a record of this.
says the guy with a drone remote...
i bet you'll find it on a certain hub in a couple day
i hope that footage makes its way here, that’d be fire tho

this is so fucked. i hate drones.

lorne crescent?
this guy is so dumb. it is hard to believe that he has been in politics for so long. dude, you weren't elected last time because you just weren't able to admit the truth with formula e. the people don't like the lack of transparency. there, all is well for you, until the end, it is 50/50, but we find you a skeleton, worse again, you are just not able to arrive "clean". instead, he's going to hide in the same mess, like a fat idiot who takes the people for cellars. are you stupid. check the bin to drop the party earlier. "i love montreal of love", my eye. he loves himself with love, and when his toy isn't there, he goes into hiding by cursing the big dirty bribes in the party that beat him. fat stupid baby not able to admit his mistakes.

music, sfw.
wouldn't even surprise me if he said that the elections were "stolen" and that he was going to initiate a lawsuit ...
i'm so curious who the lionel perez on duty will be this time around.
whatever he announces won't happen
moé i say that he landed there, even if he said there not too long ago how much he loves montreal and would sacrifice his life to protect it ...
denis codderre exit 2, electric boogaloo
as long as we're in the theme, maybe we can make a playlist for it?
i suggest to continue with [prélude no 4, opus 28.] (
donald coderre??!
it was a lot tighter last time around and he didn't.
in fact he lost other elections and there has never been anything like it.
good question.
no, that was in 2017. this year it's publisac boogaloo.
how sad is this chopin!
i don't know, is it a funeral march?
in the case of coderre, i believe this procession is more appropriate: 
>by chopin's request, this piece was played at his own funeral
>hans von bülow called the prelude "suffocation", due to its sense of despair. in fact, chopin's last dynamic marking in the piece is smorzando, which means "dying away".
cool
that's top-notch. you should brand this.
legit would buy
just not gildan, do it with "c'est beau" for a local product
the nail…. it has been hit on the head.
it's a great job, if you can produce a few hundred, you can apply to the city's tender for ppe!
id buy one
love this and would buy! keep us posted if you decide to sell :)
ooh nice follow-up! thought this was just for a halloween costume before :)
if you do more tests, consider making the logo in white (like a negative on the orange space for example)?
you should make matching pants :)
i love this. i would absolutely purchase this t shirt! 😁
that’s brilliant! i’d buy that in a heart beat!
jesus would wear this.
we will confuse you with an orange cone in the street!
that's a really good but i wouldn't even know where to start. i'll do some research, thanks
i prefer kirkland brand t shirts but the gildans are good for trying stuff out that might fail. if i ever sell these i would use kirkland.
me too
good idea. i'll try that
clown pants like the cops a little while ago…
your t-shirt should be on sale in the [ponto] store ( aovvaw2vytpgzfn9e3ndzdo1nosf)
i mean, in a way you’re buying local…gildan’s head office is in montreal!
i asked ponto. ponto said "no". :(

[fek i got a job offer monday.] ( 26% -11000 $ ish increase. completely new industry with a nice little break before starting, just to reboot my brain. all's well that ends well worse chu ben ben excited
it's been a little bit that i haven't posted here. my job is completely undermining me at the moment. i had said it at the beginning of the year, i had a very weak class. there i am at the point where i do not know what to do. yesterday in the reading assessment i found a question a little difficult. i decided to give them the answer during the morning routine. despite this, 12 did not get the answer. i am discouraged. these students make me feel incompetent as a teacher. the remedial teacher only follows 2 of my students while i have between 10 and 14 who fail. no news from the speech therapist or the shrink, but i did talk about 4 students to the speech therapist and 8 to the shrink. the management knows that my class is rubbish. they try to give me help but my students are opposed to the one who comes to take them in small groups (one accused him of a thief yesterday). and the parents in all this? half in denial, the other in helplessness. the meetings are next week but i have already had 12 meetings (where it is my free periods that pass there). i am amazed when i tell a parent "your child does not understand the simple instructions in class, what support do you have at home for french?" and that i get the answer "it's ok, i can support him in french" ... in short, i am discouraged ....
i started a new job 4 weeks ago, increase of $ 30,000 per year unlike my old job (for the curious, i went from $ 41,000 to $ 70,000) and it's a super good use!
i also do humor on the side and things are starting to go really well. comedians talk about me, sometimes there are even famous comedians who say they've heard of me and it's really cool and i'm starting to do shows that pay me more and more! the most rewarding part of all of this is people from the audience who come to me after the show to tell me how much they liked it!
let's say my business is going well right now and it's really fun! thank you for listening 😀
some john abbott college theatre students organized a pop-up halloween haunted house at the former herron residences in dorval. they reenacted the horrific events that occurred there during the early months of the pandemic. apparently, it was very very frightening and repulsive. 
too soon, i say.
chronicle of an adult learning to ride a bicycle:
i think i made my last outing of the year this week, with the cold setting in. i did less outings than i thought but it's still a good start, especially with a landing the first time which took a few weeks to stop hurting. i am not yet comfortable in traffic but i think that next year i will be able to make short trips in the neighborhood.
it happened to me twice this week that i went to look for a communauto and according to the application it is parked on the street and it just isn't there? and i spend time checking all the cars like a twit
the other day i put some bagels in the toaster and it was starting to smell like onions in the house. i accidentally bought the bagels with onions on them. i don't know who invented it but it's bagel blasphemy hahaha. i wouldn't even give that to a homeless person
speaking of mornings, now sometimes i start working at 7 a.m., sometimes at 10 a.m. i think i have a fragile sleep, it's surprising how easy it is on sleep.
my vacation week goes by at lightning speed and i feel like i haven't decompressed all of it. i dread the return to work and i wonder what urgency will fall on our knees this time. every time i think we've put out a fire, there's another fuck-up that comes out of nowhere and it's up to us to pick up the slime. everyone is overloaded, and the level of panic is constantly high. i have a month of work to type myself before the holiday break and even if it is "just" 4 weeks of work ... that tempts me so much. i looked a bit elsewhere, but the prospects are not so good: changing jobs would be a side-grade more than anything else, with little advancement in terms of salary or benefits. fuck it the same. if the first week of 2022 my boss says * one more fucking time * on monday morning that we have "a big, busy week", i submit my resignation, even though i have nothing in line afterwards.
it's still funny, i have lots of boyfriends and former colleagues who tell me all the time "you can have a lot better elsewhere!" but when i ask them if their job is hiring, all of a sudden, it's locusts.
a longtime friend is preparing to die of cancer. she won't make the month. it is flat in tabarnak. i hate it and i have no idea what to say.
i finally got some christmas lights. it's small leds with colored plastic bulbs. it's fun, color. it pisses me off to see everyone having white lights and nothing else. it's new-rich. fuck off, georges, you're not rich, you have a bungalow with an unfinished basement in the suburbs and that's all, come back.

i went to see a show yesterday.
louis-josé houde at the olympia; his first show in a while.
it was okay; it was a bit lacking in rhythm, it was probably just rusty.
podcast du moment: [comedy bang bang! the podcast]( [en]
it's rare that i fall for it so often while listening to a podcast. the host (a comedian) begins each episode with an interview with a guest, often an actor, comedian or director. in the second part, he invites absurd characters (invented and played by other comedians) to join him and the gang start to improvise and that's when i laugh. the halloween episode was a bit ugly (too much vocals), but the others were great for getting me out of the boredom of work.
i need a wireless headset. i am looking for a pair that is more robust and comfortable than for audiophile quality (it will be for wearing only on public transport). recommendations?
have a good weekend everyone! i know we're all a little bored, but it's going to be okay slowly :)
i am relieved by the election result but not so enthusiastic. i am also surprised that there was not so much participation.
otherwise it's been officially 6 months that i am unemployed and i capote. by wanting to console me, my boyfriend tells me that at least there are plenty of mcjobs hiring, and then i saw all my bad life choices pass before my eyes. crime, so i should have done a technique ..
did anyone else hear the low vibration this morning in the west plateau?
me, i just want to know if there are breweries like daniel lapointe or fleurimont in montreal?

woo hoo! congrats.
are you a spokesperson for the spvm by any chance?
photolab yves-thomas is where i print my stuff, good services and easy to work with. not sure if it’s what you’re looking for, but they also have a “starter” package with samples, examples of prints on different materials (different papers, canvas, gatoboard, etc) that could help you maybe.
provisia. it is relatively close to the namur metro. i go there often and the prices are excellent for the quality. the vibe is smooth too.
i too am looking to make some prints, black on white background, super simple designs from jpegs. i've never done this before, what would i do?
i actually need to do that as well, i usually go to concordia copies.
you can go to the caïus du livre. the make great prints and many artists in montreal has used this printer to make their self-published books.
wow, i'm glad.

you know the pandemic is over when people complain about the stm. / s
i was in peel, there was smoke to the point where we could not see each side of the wharf. code 900-05 (fire) was heard before being evacuated. at least there was a good reason to stop the service, but the communication really leaves a lot to be desired.
worse there is the orange which is in slow motion.
tabarnak crisse esti
*laughs in remote worker*
but seriously when i see this i have a surge of anxiety, what if it was the month just before an important date?
you just have to wait 10 years, and then you will be able to take the rem from the east on a parallel circuit.
stm doesn't want the world to come back to work.
[deleted]
people at stm should learn what from japan. that kind of message would be unacceptable there.
same thing happened to me yesterday going home. metro was down for like an hour, insult to the injury of having to work en presentiel for no fucking reason. 
good thing i decided not to go in today, i would have very likely quite literally lost my mind. 
going back to work in person is really weighing super heavily on me, mentally. 😔
memory of the stm: caller a "service slowdown" when your train has not moved for 15 minutes.
if there is a breakdown tomorrow it will make a x3 combo
yesterday also, 30 minutes stop on the orange line between 8:30 am and 9:00 am.
3 days out of 4 a service interruption ...

twenty years + of my life in seoul, south korea has never given me such horrible metro service. in montreal i experience some kind of delay at least once every 2 weeks what and today it is the pirrrreeee.
what annoys me is that it is not clear whether taking the orange to go to berry would allow me to take the green again to go to l'assomption.
quebec hydro once turned my power off from 8am-3pm on a workday to do maintenance. i tweeted at them to tell them i was annoyed by their choice of time. 
they responded, "no time is a good time."
i responded, "weekends are an objectively better time."
no response.
if this was a dad with two white girls in the exact same circumstances we would have been bombarded with 20 alerts already.
too few criteria? lmao
lemme guess they don’t have the complexion for the protection right?
it makes me a little stupid that it is so complicated.
the mother disappeared with her two children by public transport? what if it's a kidnapping? maybe the mother is a victim too?
we should do everything to find missing children, whether or not they have been abducted. what incompetence ... i also believe that if they had white skin the alert would already be triggered. it's absolutely sad
anyway, the amber alert is con right? yen a ben too bad i sleep at night. don't want to make me wake up bastard
man this is infuriating as i get amber alerts in the middle of the night for shit happening in brampton, but the local gouv wont put out an amber alert for these girls that's around my area?? it's absurd.
it has nothing to do with the color of their skin or anything. there have been similar cases with children of all origins.
the first test is that the police have reasonable grounds to believe that the child or children have been abducted.
here the entourage is "worried". the father did not come to say "the mother has taken the children".
the mother may be in psychological distress ... or she may not feel well in the environment she was in because of pressure from those around her. we do not know.
the mother has ample right to get the hell out of where she is, whatever the reason ... the police cannot trigger an amber alert every time it comes to a child.
just hope the mother will give some news soon to indicate that she and her children are safe.
but canada is less worse than the united states ...
they mustnt've fit the profile
i was going to post this information however i was told not to post this kind of information anymore.
excatly what i also just wrote above. i really hope they find them all alive and well. these kids could be two of my students. my heart breaks for that poor dad.
two little blondes with blue eyes, and we would be (rightfully so) constantly bombarded by the media. it's crazy. can we just find them safe and sound, please?
it pisses me off that at least 7 people did not understand the sarcasm on your post
it's part of the game hahaha
coderre will sulk because all he cares about is being mayor and not serving the community.
coderre never wanted to serve the community, he only wanted to serve himself.
old tea towel.
he did not even call valérie plante following the elections which is the norm and the minimum of civility. he did not respond to the mayor's calls.
it really is junk.
edith butler: i made a mistake. coderre is garbage, not garbage.
no news is good news.
denis coderre, annamie paul, same fight. classless narcissists.
spoiled baby criss, boomer out!
i've been saying this for months: it's déni coderre
guess we won't be stuck with him after all
i imagine him in his batcave planning a revenge for a fat baby who has lost
worse it feels good!
i'll get downvoted to hell for not getting on the bandwagon, but ok sure, give him a bit of time? i know this sub is super anti-coderre (i get it, he doesn't skew young), but wtf do i care if he waits a week to announce his intensions? he'll probably leave politics anyway. the guy obviously cares a lot about montreal and put in a big effort for his comeback, and these are life-changing decisions to make in a very short time, so the media (um, tva *cringe*) can wait a bit. chill. politicians are still human, even if you disagree with them. don't inject your personal feelings into everything you read about the guy.
edit: yay downvoted: reminder that the downvote button isn't a "disagree" button
it's because he loves montreal so much that he can't bear to be less than a mayor!
2 days ago, plante said that coderre ended up responding to his texts.
is that masculine junk?
edit: no, that's what i thought.
edit: it could have .. it's like an / an opinion, it is said relatively well ... i wasn't french-shaming!
next on dancing with the stars
with a little respect, you wouldn't be here without us. / s
he's a career politician who left politics to make $440k a year from the companies he did favours for in office. he is exactly the kind of politician that makes people cynical about politics. he doesn't need our sympathy.
> the guy obviously cares a lot about montreal
so why, for the second time in a row, does he not want to lead the opposition?
> these are life-changing decisions to make in a very short time
a short time?  he's known since throwing his hat in the ring that losing was a possibility; his mind was made up a long time ago.  it's mayor or nothing for him because he's selfish like that.
denis has been  on the political scene for 35 years. if montrealers are so salty it is because his behaviour, (post election and during the campaign) fit exactly with the denis we know for so long. 
have you only followed his campaign?   wacky candidates, lies about the cell phone, won't release his revenues unless elected... weak platform.
big time, this sub may as well be named, 
/projetmontreal. i'm probably the oldest one in here and i'm only in my 40s. lol
the love for plante in here is far fetched, very trump like.
quite frankly, i would take one.

hey! author here... i've also put in some locations around the city where you could take a photo of the moon at eclipse maximum framed with some montréal landmarks. 
i have a map of them here: [
if you have other locations that look southwest you think might be a good location for a photo, let me know! i can add it to the map.
thank you !
thank you so much for explaining in plain english where when how !!
pleasure! sorry, i wrote only in english, but i hope the info is good for you
my pleasure! hoping the weather will cooperate
hey man no problem!
now kith
whenever i see that, i think “kids in the hall”
honestly i don’t think a third language would be particularly useful here. pick what you’re interested in the most.
php and js stacks
spanish, arabic and creole would probably be the most useful generally, but honestly it all depends on where you plan to live in montreal, and even then the overwhelming majority of people would have no problem answering in french or english.
french - english - corruption
from a montrealer and english-to-french translator: i'd advise getting real good in french first and foremost. it's not an easy language and if you're that motivated you'll gain way more from learning french very well than half-assing it and learning a few phrases in several languages.
although canada is officially bilingual, the province of québec is officially french-speaking, and a lot of cultural activities, communications, public display, etc. are in french only. (for example, the whole public transportation system in montreal is only in french.)
also, no matter how strong your accent is, locals truly appreciate when they can fully interact in french with you.
just my 2 cents.
spanish!
in my experience, no other language is useful in montreal. i’m fluent in spanish but never found it to be useful here.
after you're done learning french, you can choose whatever language you want. it doesn't really make a difference as almost everyone speaks french (and a few only speak english). the vast majority of citizens of arabic origin speak very good french.
i think it really depends on what culture you're in contact with most often. after french and english it all gets pretty low. it can depend on things like the neighborhood or even area you hang out in.
data from 2016: 
if you want to capitalize on french, then choose spanish. if you have an interest in semitic languages, then morocan arabic is cool, also hebrew. if you want to capitalize on ~~english~~ (joking you can't it's been stripped of all grammar) anglo-saxon languages, then you can go with yiddish that is still spoken.
if you're interested in something entirely new, then iroquois or inuktitut is possble.
but if you're looking for usefulness, then honestly, mandarin is the only one that is used on a day to day basis.
to give you a somewhat serious answer, north african dialects or maybe lebanese.
also haitian creole.
darija for arabic. some haitian creole could be useful as well, especially with the youth.
i think it would nice to learn an indigenous language local to the area...such as mohawk. i've learned a little bit of inuktitut, innu, and naskapi over the years while living in different parts of quebec and nunavik.
once you're comfortable with french, you could then learn haitian creole pretty quickly, which can be quite motivating and make you addicted into learning more and more languages.
python
the correct answer is italian....greek would be 2nd
mandarin is next.
to be honest, knowing italian, northern african arabic dialect (moroccan/algerian) and haitian creole and of course spanish will really get you bigger opportunities in montreal.
i say that as an eastern european btw.
spanish, arabic, vietnamese, portuguese, italian, and chinese are all spoken. 
i hear some lady speak german to her kids every day getting on the train, but that's just her.
i'm also american. i've been speaking french for a couple years, and learning it's still keeping me busy. i took several years of spanish growing up, and i'm close to several people who speak arabic. none of us consider either if those languages necessary outside of social situations. 
i don't use spanish at all, but i hear it spoken daily.
you can learn those languages for fun, but only french and english could be necessary.
greek
useful but i would like to be able to see where the district in question is located.
[
excuse me i meant by pole of vote.
i love watching the losing parties all throw each other under the bus post-élection. dumpster fire 🔥
> "a problem of ego and lack of leadership"
honestly, denis had no chance from the start. his "bully" personality doesn't quite fit what people are looking for these days.
> "the organization made no sense"
and it wanted to be responsible for the town hall? aie aie aie
not surprisingly given coderre's results and "leadership".
what is flat, in my opinion, is that plante deserved to be asked serious and difficult questions about his tenure.
the housing crisis.
the price of houses.
the bickering within projet montreal.
the taxes that keep going up.
the pink line (hahaha!).
the blue line.
and so on. but none of this was really discussed during the campaign. rather, it was coderre who made more mistakes and defended his campaign.
(in)competent
it's the best.
is this the new slogan of ensemble montreal?
on the contrary, he could easily have gotten more votes in non-central neighborhoods if he had done a real campaign (he didn't).
the taxes that keep going up? there is no taxation at the municipal level.
half of your "questions" do not or very little arise from municipal functions.
le devoir asked plante most of these questions in his editorial interview:
the fact that these subjects have not or little been discussed gives me the impression that we are so poorly represented.
also the waste to the suburbs.
all agree. if ensemble montreal does not deveinent the chariot party (and coderre ... and sexual assault), it would be easier to vote them. we need a party of the center and modernity, not the populism of the tank.
maybe, but with electoral fatigue he should have fought to get people to vote. in many of these neighborhoods the participation rate was very low (<30%)
easily, no.
he could have gone looking for more though.
the thing is, with a more aggressive campaign, especially on bikes and everything, he probably would have won as much, if not less, votes in the non-central neighborhoods than he would have lost in the central neighborhoods.
in the end, he was just not a good candidate for opposition to plante. and i'm pretty sure the opponents rallied behind him for lack of convincing someone better.
he is given the benefit of the doubt and it is assumed that he or she was talking about property taxes ...
with a turnout that is roughly a third of the electorate, we are obviously not well represented. it's like an election in iran.
yes quite. he didn't fight, didn't offer anything interesting. it was really his arrogance that hurt him.
thank you. i'll spare you a "ninja edit".
i love that this is labeled under "gastronomie" but it is. 
by far the best falafel ive had in north america. and let me tell you, the secret is in the pita... the guy who runs it used to have a pita company in montreal, abu lafia. 
walked in wth my gf the other day and she proposed that they cater our engagement party.... this is precisely why im marrying her!
fuck me, this place is delicious. the falafel sandwich is the best in the city... try it with kosher pickles. world peace in a pita.
yo the real ones know. fsj is a gem.
no joke, i would order the shish taouk, and thought i was eating chicken for months until a friend told me it was all vegetarian. love this place. the chocolate babka is also to die for! i spend way too much money when i go now cause i have to try new things every time.
one of the best sandwiches in the city, for sure. don’t let the “vegan” label turn you off, fellow omnivores. their mint lemonade in the summer is great, and they’ll have sufganiyot come hanukkah.
the falafel pita is on point. pro tip: ask for fried eggplant in your sandwich. 
also, their salad selections are great. good options: thai eggplant, brussel sprouts, quinoa salad, tabbouleh, cauliflower. 
i always leave with a medium sized container of hummus and a bag or two of pita. their hummus is heavy on the tahini. not everyone's cup of tea (my wife and kid don't love it).
great falafel and the lady at the counter is the best.
i was an og. i lived nearby when they first opened a couple years ago and i went there pretty frequently.
i don't ever bother getting falafel from anywhere else. nothing comes close, it's the real deal.  also the owner speaks english, french, arabic and hebrew , welcomes like 99% of his customers in their own language.
:( mtl i miss you.
i found out about them only recently through family recommendation. my goodness, it is the best falafel i've had outside of israel, and somehow makes me even love halva! 
this place is a must
no parking and its mad ghetto area. but agreed the food is great. i go there almost everytime im in the area for the gun club.
ahhh love em! my old job used to order really awful pizza for events and at one point switched to falafel st j and i don't think i'd ever been happier about a free meal. i don't think i've had a single bad thing from them
yes best falafel hands down! 
there's also another one that's really good too called falafel yoni
was painting in lachine and my friend has celiac disease and when we got there he listened and heard her issues and got out a better bread from us with flour imported from israel. he spoke to me and my friends with so much kindness and passion. i wish it was closer cause that was one of the greatest meals i’ve ever had.
every friday i eat a pita instead in lachine. this is my favorite restaurant in montreal. a serious 10/10. i just hope they don't explode in popularity and go down in quality ...
thanks for the recc, absolutely going to give it a try!
[deleted]
i was super sceptical, but i tried the shish taouk plate and was floored!  i went in prepared to hate it. love the salad selections also.
with all the salad choices when you take the plate
i found those kijiji link: 
let us know if its still available!
[i tried this place ](
i tried baseball shops around us (canada) nothing so far. i *really* appreciate anyone's time while looking and keeping their eyes peeled. 
i know it sounds dumb as it's "only a hat" but it's the one gift his father gave him that meant something to him (they used to go to the games together when he was a child). 
he's been a mess since. 
the worst is we think he lost it at the surprise birthday party i threw him last weekend. so the entire thing is messing him up as he was so grateful for the surprise and all his friends showing up but then he loses his hat (which is like, almost, a family heirloom) all at once. 
he's so freaking heart broken it's killing me. i just want to replace it. i know it won't be the same but than we can start a "true" (funny) winter heirloom based on a gift, gifted by love/replaced also by love.
idk how to word it. sorry if it's just a rambling.  i'm also going to try to post on other subreddits. not sure which yet. argh, this sucks. :(
this might sound stupid and cheesy, but have you considered getting a different expo hat? like it would be a gesture of new beginning for you two, while also having a hint of nostalgia from the previous hat?  
i’m putting myself in his shoes and being gifted the same hat, i don’t think it would be the same thing, knowing it’s not the one my dad gave me years ago.
try logo sport on st laurent... i've found some nice vintage stuff there.. and if you ever go in person, theres a few thrift shops close by who sell old sports jackets and tuques...
push comes to shove, perhaps you could ask a knitter to make one for him?
best i could find.
mvp
i messaged both adds! thank you :)
really hope they answer! i'm so excited! thank you so much!
thanks for your reply and sharing your thoughts.  
actually, i did order him a similar but different one on etsy and it simple wasn't the same. for him, he wants the exact same one back :(
i reached out to the two links that were shared and really hoping i can get my hands on it! wish me luck and have a great day!
boo :(
that's a really bad copy and/or attempt of the winter beanie am looking for.
the colors are not even 360 degrees 
that's said, you're freaking cool for trying and pointing me towards the right direction! 
you're a kind soul <3
if it's that meaningful to you/him and it's important to get right i'd just get it knitted not sure you'll be able to find an exact copy as a lot of expos gear from back them is no longer in production. i'd give etsy a shot? also try /r/expos ([looks like you did already](
you're right! i'll extend my search to etsy!
because you're right, it *is* meaningful to*me*because it means so much to him!
i'll check out knitting crew of etsy, but if you have a reference i'm down to check out the store!
i really hope i can find this beanie!
looks like someone in your r/expos thread found a really close version of it
given that it seems to be a cheap promo item from petro-canada (a gas station) maybe try them too
edit: in fact, more results for "petro-canada expos" ([close but no dice]( try "toque" or "tuque" terms too along with "beanie"
if it'd the link i'm thinking of, i bought it lol
i'll go check again to make sure. thank you! :)
all the help is truly appreciated
he will be able to ask forgiveness

[here's a video]( if you want to skip the blogspam.
i have a friend who died the same way a few years ago: truck turning right. personally, since, when i arrive at a red light and a truck is in position to turn right, i stand to its left to be sure not to suffer the same fate.
truck drivers have extremely hard angles to keep track of. if you're a cyclist you need to be aware of this and assume they do not see you.
one of my closest friends in elementary school lost her older sister in an extremely similar accident. tragic.
i live in that area and the trucks regularly act like no one lives around there, that it's just an industrial zone where you can go as fast as you like. it's terrifying as a parent because i have a teen who is going to be using that street to get to school.
if you are driving a multi-tonne vehicle that can trap and murder pedestrians, cyclists etc, you are responsible. you have to drive slowly, you have to check your blind spots. you can't just turn corners without making sure the way is clear.
and there aren't many other options for safe routes around there (despite someone asking why the cyclist was on st laurent). parc ex and villeray are terribly connected, and many people take liege because it's a relatively quiet, low traffic and residential area. but because of its proximity to hydro quebec and the 40, we often see massive trucks treating it like it's a free for all.
câlisse, i live nearby and i ride my bikes every day. it freezes the blood. poor sir.
to say that just a few days ago, a certain candidate for mayor said roughly that bike paths are dangerous
we can see that when there is none, this kind of thing can happen easily ...
rip
i hope for the driver of the truck that he really had to do in that corner because liège is prohibited for trucks except for local deliveries.
i am a long distance truck driver. a (edit :) right, next to the door you are almost 100% blind, unless you have the mirror on your nose. even then, it's only in the little mirror at the end of the nose of the truck that you can be seen. it is the worst place to be.
the best thing to do. make eye contact with the driver when you are stopped. place yourself where you can do it, when you make contact with it's eyes, you've just been recorded in the obstacles around him in his head, he'll make sure to avoid you.
edit: a la droite. (i speak english most days, i make mistake sometimes lol)
keep a distance of 3 meters with all trucks at all time when you are cycling! this needs to be taught to every childs and adults getting on a bike.
so why is it that we don’t require side guards on large trucks again?
with so little detail, it's impossible to know who is at fault here. the truck could have abruptly turned right with zero signalling, or the cyclist may have been in the truck driver's blind spot for blocks. or it could be the "hole in the swiss cheese" scenario where the dangerous aspect of cycling meets the dangerous aspect of trucking at once. what's very real is that it is a tragedy and must be examined further.
happens way too often
these kind of accidents always devolve into a finger pointing game of who is at fault. some saying cyclists or drivers ought to be more aware, more careful, change their driving etc.
the truth is the more cyclists share the road with motor vehicles, the higher the likelihood accidents such as this happen. accidents can happen anywhere and to anyone, but if the infrastructure is made in a way that prevents trucks and cyclists to even be in proximity to each other, it won't be an issue. the real solution is developing infrastructure that separates cyclists from motor vehicles as much as possible.
i, unfortunately, commute through westmount, where i work, to the plateau, where i live. the bike lanes in westmount along westmount ave  are full of leaves, huge piles of them, and about every 5 yards or so, a heavy vehicle parked in the bike lane. these are mainly the gardeners and various other trades people of the wealthy. as far as i can tell and experience on a daily basis, the folks in westmount have zero respect for the bike lanes, forcing me to compete with the traffic. don’t get me started on the humongous vehicles driven in order to deliver a school child, usually one, to one of the many private schools along the way.
in 2008, a little girl was run over a few meters away by a truck as well. these are not the same circumstances, but the same end of the street.

as long as big trucks with huge blind spots are allowed in the city, there will be pedestrian and cyclist deaths. 
it’s not the cyclist’s fault for not “looking the driver in the eye” or for “pulling up beside the truck and not behind”, nor is it the fault of “a truck driver who needs more training”. these deaths are always the fault of the city that continues to allow big trucks into city streets, where they are allowed to share space with people walking and biking. the amount of people/bikes covered in these blind spots is insane (think 20 people or bikes, not one or two), basically the whole right side. dump trucks (up so high) are the worst, since the whole front is a blind spot, too. it infuriates me that there are no special regulations/prohibitions for dump trucks, seeing as they’re basically blind, speeding, deadly, heavy people-crushing tanks. 
if you’ve ever lived in a neighborhood under construction (griffintown, i’m looking at you), you know how the constant parade of dump trucks, cement mixers, and semis invade - creating a deadly caravan of blind people crushers.   i myself was hit by a medium delivery truck as a pedestrian crossing the street about 10 years ago. the driver was turning left from a one-way street to a two-way street and both of our lights (my pedestrian and his street light) were green. he couldn’t see me under the engine block. i lived, but only because i ran backwards and jumped up, waving my arms so the driver saw my arms over the engine block. 
london had a lorry control scheme before the pandemic that made large trucks apply for permits to enter the city, and only at night, i believe. i wonder if it’s still in place. 
the city of montreal needs to stop having pedestrians, bikers, and turning traffic share the same green lights! the only time i’ve ever felt safe in this damn city are the few street corners that allow all four corners of pedestrians a dedicated crossing light, with all traffic stopped completely on red lights. but the city doesn’t do it because traffic moving fast is a higher priority than a handful of people being crushed to death. if you have kids, it’s best to just teach them to stay the hell away from any corner or crossing with a large truck, and to wait until there are only cars. at least if they get hit by one of those, they stand a chance.
those trucks are just way too big for cities
poor visibility on all sides
cars take up too much of what should be a shared space for all citizens. and they stink! i will never give up the dream of a car-less city. cars and trucks need to go!
it must also be said that garbage trucks often drive like sick people in the city, often well above the speed limit. this kind of drama unfortunately does not surprise me.
so sad
shit it must be the dude who asked where to find the mafia the other day
ah, good. five minute walk from here. and we are asked why we want to leave town.
weird that the gazette is calling him a mob boss
but weren't they supposed to save the city from street gangs?
"for his part, oliverio has no criminal record.": hahaha, it's still fucked up that, while all his criminal history is listed in the article
lapresse also!
i guess they can't agree on who's going to do it
no shit, it was written in the sky
without jokes, desjardins was forcing himself for a good campaign in his party and he could have taken my vote as well as several thousand others who were going to plante.
"he adds that mr. desjardins was only one candidate among others, and that as such, he had no decision-making power within the party." he can propose what he wants, but this 'it is i who have the final decision, "said mr holness"
oh my god, all that is not to hear
holness didn't give a damn about montreal city hall. what he wanted was to make himself known, as mélanie joly did before him.
desjardins was really naive about this one, but it still confirms my impression of balarama holness as being a typical west island "angryphone" doubled as a fool who thinks he is more "smatte" than he really is.
holness is a tdc, but desjardins was naive with no blood.
i guess you could say that...  he got sacked!

very good idea sir.

why can’t the anglophones/francophones just be a big happy family together 😢
a bit of a holness asshole.

the montreal municipal elections remain the best reality tv show season after season.
can anyone explain what happened? i did not follow this particular story and am now curious.
m-antoine desjardins is a very handsome man 🤩
it's a shame that this attitude is rewarding.
goddamn fucking nimbys god forbid they build some temporary poles so that people have a place to live.
oh no! my view of a pristine historical industrial canal, filled with factory sludge, has been ruined by something that has never, ever been part of the landscape in this manufacturing neighborhood - electricity poles!
geez the little bourgeoisie can't cope with a few temporary poles... talk about first world problems.
they are right, stupid electricity. i say we bring back coal powered ships and have them go up and down the canal, as it was meant to be, distributing lumps of coal for the fancy condos to heat themselves with.
always blaming the poles..
just remember this is what your tax dollars pay for at the cbc
bcp bcp of humor in this thread .. i love it! :)
let's take a step back here, i'm pretty sure the people complaining were never told it was going to be temporary. they saw the poles and called the press. the press then inquired and learned it was temporary.
this is a non story and let's stop bashing random people on the internet.
i think the condos are disruptive go fuck yourselves
> "we were really in shock," she said. "we didn't know what to do, and we didn't know whom to talk to tell 'it's unacceptable.'"
imagine being outraged because you genuinely can't fathom not having veto power over public works.
how self-important do you have to be to even want your portrait to be taken for such a ludicrous nimby issue.
this is why i posted this as i don't understand people sometime.
as someone who has lived through the transformation of the canal, the gentrification and condos are amazing. the canal is now the crown jewel of montreal after the mountain, it’s a beautiful spot.
[deleted]
hey, i like to have a clear view of derelict factories!
> boshouwers said setting up poles does little to conserve the site.
i wonder how she feels about her participation in gentrifying the site, and how much people like her have already altered the landscape well beyond its historical parameters. those 4 new poles occupy about 28 square feet of land in total. how big is her condo?
the canal would look beautiful with a bunch of fires alongside it

i'm terribly sorry for your loss. 
i'm not personally familiar with any in-person groups in montreal, but i did frequent a private facebook group called grief beyond belief (which is strictly secular, hence the name) and found a lot of solace through it for many years after my father passed. maybe that could help in the meantime as you search for one that meets in person in the city. 
i will keep thinking and get back to you if i remember other good resources.
sorry for the loss of your husband.
there is the help line: 1 888 le deuil (1 888 533 3845)
they also have some resources listed on their web site:
 * 
 * 
so sorry for the loss of your husband...
you should try calling info-santé: 8-1-1. at some point in the phone menu there's an option for "info-social", press that option and you may ask them for resources in your area. that number is free, 24/7.
so sorry for your loss. during the pandemic, everything mental health is overwhelmed but here's hoping this helps
might sound weird, but if you are even slightly religious, i know that almost every type of church and religion offer grief counseling. 
i also know the clsc have support groups, but you might need to call a few times before you actually get referred.
finally, google "thérapeute en acceptation du deuil" if you have the means to afford it. these people are often retired nurses or social workers who give there services, almost like a psychologist.
i wish you good luck. in my experience, the first year is the worst. best advice i got from a therapist is that your goal for right now should be to survive the next 365 days only, not a lifetime alone. pay your bills, stay alive, function and survive and get stuff taken car of. the rest will be waiting when you are ready. good luck
❤️
my previous girlfriend also passed away tragically this year. one of the best things i ever did for myself was find a grief counselor (through the funeral home, thankfully enough). a group is great but a counselor helped me much more. much love and courage to you.
sorry for your loss.
voluntas ( a funeral home in the west island ) has a list of resources 
deuil jeunesse saved my life when my mother passed away. i don't think there is any other organization that is as knowledgeable as they are in quebec for grief counseling. if they call you back, give them a chance, they are very worth it. i am very sorry for your loss.
i just want to offer you my condolences. i'm very sorry for your loss and wish you the best. i hope you find a support group soon. you've had some good suggestions here, but should you need more help, 811 info-santé can also put you in touch with people or groups who deal with grief.
my sincere condolences. on top of the suggestions already provided, know that [l'ordre des psychologues du québec]( have a directory of paychologists, psychiatrists and psychotherapists that specialise in grief counselling. you can filter by your language of preference and postal code too.
i'm very sorry for your loss. i wish that you find the help you seek.
yooooo here’s a hug 🤗
i'm so sorry for your loss :( 
i'm from the west island too. went through the same thing a few years ago. 
below are some resources i used or heard about! 
please send me an email and we can get in touch :) it's been over 6 years for me, but i'm sure there's a way i can help out. we could go for a walk.

myra’s kids is a weekend long summer camp in mtl area for kids who have lost someone important (usually a parent or sibling). my kids attended this summer and it was amazing. they have great resources.
way widow group
corrie sirota (she is one of the people from myra’s kids) also hosts a monthly widow group. you can e-mail her at corrie@myraskids.ca and she will send you the zoom link for the next meeting. 
nova west island
they also offer some bereavement groups you might be interested in. i think there are some for kids and adults too. 
the dinner party
this one is a hit or miss - they don’t always have in-person events in the montreal area, but i know they have some virtual events!
i used to host widow groups before, but most of my attendees are taking a break from the support groups now that it's been some time. i can let you know when i start another.
sorry for your loss.
call 811 and choose option 2-info social. they’ll be able to direct you to the appropriate resources whether it be a mh practitioner at your local clsc, phone counselling, group therapy or volunteer services. they’re also there if you just want to talk. 
you could also check if your employer has an eap that offers free psychological help, or look at your insurance coverage. 
hang in there (ungendered) sis. it’s the worst now, but every day will be slightly better than the previous.
i’m very sorry for the loss of your husband, i too know loss and benefit greatly from talking through it i use the homewood health line, they put you in touch with support quickly and you can call anytime you need them i hope it helps and i wish you the best in your time of grief
i looked up the group and it's actually helpful. both me and my husband weren't religious at all. can't thank you enough for the recommendation
thank you
thank you
however, i think that carthage should be destroyed
this event is brought to you by spqr
aurora montreal.
taken last wednesday from the bridge side of île aux pies. it wasn't the lights of the desjardins tower for once!
it's subtle. was it more visible in person?
at this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the country, localized entirely within your kitchen?
i just pretend that the green lights beaming into the clouds from dt are the auroras.
whaat. i want to see one too! i have to go and post myself or for that?
woowwwww! it's very rare!
[deleted]
wow. was it by chance or did you plan it? and if so, how?
it's very subtle because most of the aurora got stuck in traffic coming into montreal.
i have already seen a superb one on the 15 near blainville, it was a sunday evening in winter.
the 2nd most beautiful thing i have seen in my life, i had to stop on the edge of the highway because the beauty had entered me so much.
wow, do you think there'll be more activity soon? was it visible by the naked eye?
there have been quite a few reports of solar flares lately, wonder if that's why we'd see these so far south from the poles :o
/edit: seems like it! 
there will be more and more :). to be magically beautiful
oh yes, the beautiful dawn of the gardens
ho wow when was that?
you're lucky. i always wanted to see him.
i hope this isnt bad news
nah it's desjardins

ok, this teacher is crazy and should be fired on the spot.
the fact that she lodged a complaint against the * bad * black student clearly should have put the administration's tip in the background. absolutely disgusting.
this situation is surreal. there seems to be very questionable behavior on both sides but the teacher seems to have deliberately chosen the provocation. but still why we never talk about the context in which the word is used ...
to treat someone as n is very, very, very bad. we get along. but from there to saying that only hearing the word is traumatic, in my opinion it is trying to instrumentalize the "word" for its own benefit and use it to establish a balance of power / power towards someone else .
i think of what happened in ottawa but also of the story i read of a black rapper during a show invited an enthusiastic (white) spectator to sing with him one of his songs on stage . there was the n word in the song and when she said it he stopped the show and publicly rebuffed her in front of everyone.
as a french speaker the word "frog" has been used as an insult against me and my ancestors for generations. do we have fits every time the word is used?
the situation always looks horrible when presented, but you only have one side of the story so it's not worth much. the article makes vague generalizations at the end and non-sequitur ... not sure what they are trying to say.
what is equally sad is that the author of the article is absolutely unable to write the word "nigger" even though it is a quote.
writing a word in a context of quotation or to relate facts is not to glorify it.
let us know how to make the difference!
for the situation in question, it is understandable that people feel hurt by the use of a word. however, we only have here the student's version, not that of her teacher or even of the other students who remained in class.
without this, this article is of little value and is not sufficient to get a clear idea of what really happened.
yark. it's not difficult to say n word instead of saying the real words. check your privileges and the balance of power in this situation. it's just wanting to stir up some shit and pose as a victim. the book is outdated anyway.
> as a french speaker the word "frog" has been used as an insult against me and my ancestors for generations. do we have fits every time the word is used?
it's really far from the same ...
well in this case, the context is that the teacher wanted uselessly to provoke her students and she flopped when they said "stop please".
it may also be the teachers who are, in the long run, sickened to teach students who are always offended by everything and nothing worse who impose their own way of saying things to others in the name of a supposed moral superiority.
>check tes privileges
i sprained myself rolling my eyes. i thought we abandoned that empty phrase 10 years ago.
what is the n word?
i don't know why you're downvoted, it's clearly not as loaded frog as the n-word (even if frog is indeed loaded).
why? have you ever been called a "fucking frog"?
have we ever complained that it triggers the word * frog * when used outside of its insult context ...
pretty sure the n word is universally offensive and indefensible. especially in front of a black person, who are the direct subject of the persecution of the word.
hopefully the teacher loses her job without going to court. there are literally like 3 offensive words you can't say. if this is the title of the book, you say it once fine. otherwise you're being a deliberate asshole and racist.
eille, check the steps first and use the word as you want, you have the right, there are even tatas which will come to defend you in the name of the freedom of expression. a salaried, unionized adult who has the whole school system on her side vs. young people who just don't want to hear the word because it hurts them. it's your choice to be a mess.
hahaha! do we want to ban users from reddit? 😁
the hate word lol
> have we ever complained that it triggered us
well no, precisely. it's not such a loaded word, whereas the n-word is. anyway, it's not the place of non-black people to decide that the word is no longer offensive.
> not bad on that the n word is ** universally ** offensive and indefensible
no, there are some who can say it and others not, according to a social consensus. worse the fact that you want the teacher to lose her job (without having any details since the article does not provide any), that tells me quite a bit what kind of person you seem to be.
and are there like 3 words we can't say? i'm giving you a list that has 21, but in total there are like fifty, it's made f \ * cking ridiculous (including ** mum and dad **, as if no one was born from between the legs of his **mother**):
[
controlling what people should say is also controlling how they think.
> pretty sure that the n word is universally offensive and indefensible.
there are famous black authors who have published books with this word in french. it is american imperialism to impose the american interpretation of the word in the francophonie. why would it be up to the anglophone to dictate to us francophone the meaning of words? why not the other way around?
> not bad on that the n word is universally offensive and indefensible

now imagine this same sky, but instead of hundreds of ugly grey concrete buildings you have mountains, trees and a lake or river at the bottom.
but then how would op have this heightened point of view?
“now imagine this same sky, but montreal doesn’t exist and this sub doesn’t exist and nobody lives here and quebec’s largest metropolis is gone”
there's a mini mountain in the center of the city...
i was there today too. our class was evacuated by a shock team (men in black with guns, like in the movies).
the cegep says it's back to normal since 4pm. i have no idea what's going on.
couple tweets just to add to the conversation :

it was a false alarm.
wtf i study there and didn't even get notified in any way.
does anyone know what happened?
edit: spelling
i wonder where does the information come from that this is related to the shooting?
how do you know it's a false alarm? the college has given 0 information on the subject.
when i was a teenager i rented an stm bus to bring me and my friends to prom. it came with a driver, and he let us drink and party inside while he drove us around. different era maybe.
does it come with an angry driver?
about xxl
i think this needs to start up again.
gotta cover the deficit, kinda cool
so basically i can start my own tourist bus tour business at any point?
i'd do it as long as the driver is the guy who sings a song for each stop
(left fields)
also, along the same line of thought, if you have your own [wagon] ( train, you can attach it to an amtrak train. to usa.
can you just use it to do whatever you want with?
nice!
r / montreal pub crawl 2022. transportation by stm, we stop at the ice floe for food and the colonial bath is naturally the last stop.
gta mode : throw the driver off and drive yourself around with a huge bus!! nobody can stop you!
that's pretty cool.
when my wife and i got married in hong kong a decade ago, we rented a double decker city bus to take us all from the ceremony location to the reception dinner for about the same price.
considering the fairly limiting restrictions, i can't imagine many situations where renting an stm bus is your best choice of transportation.
why does that sound too cheap to be real?
they did that sometimes at my elementary school when we had outings
it's a booze bus!not a new idea but def cool if the vibe is right...
how much would a school bus be?
what if you rent an entire day?
i actually did this for prom. cost me $700 in 2013. with 30 or so people on it, we saved a hell of a lot compared to the limo kids.
they actually gave us literally a brand new bus at the time and the bus driver was super nice and was happy to let us play music and looked the other way from certain activities. needless to say, we looked way cooler showing up at prom.
it was also super easy then too. they let you pick a route, weren't too picky to deviate, just needed to go to the frontenac garage and sign some papers and give a deposit.
it's boring, but it doesn't sound impossible, just more boring.
for those who are interested it is behind the trees: 
"in a document sent to the editorial staff, the dause recognizes that faced with the risks for the public, ** the demolition of the house is necessary **.

one problem that nobody knows but is that there are several of these heritage houses on jarry which were destroyed when it should have been preserved.
there is none left and we absolutely do not want to lose one more, but it is too late in its current state.
36% participation...is pathetic 😑
all that is in gray are boroughs demerged by the liberal government of jean charest, mainly anglo / liberal.
the demerger of the boroughs directly led to a party like projet montréal to take the lead in the face of the type of governance à la gérald tremblay and denis coderre of this world.
so for a rare time, thank you jean charest
cdn-ndg now has a project montreal mayor.
outside perez!
why does saint-laurent vote so overwhelmingly for denis coderre? like what's the appeal for this borough? i live there and do not get it but i only moved there a few years ago so maybe someone with more mtl-knowledge can explain it to me?
not badly disappointed with my hood, rdp-pat. i mean come on. since plante has been here, we have seen certain improvements in public transport and the safety of the main streets, something that would probably have been reversed with coderre. (i'm mostly talking about rdp, i don't visit pat often)
here’s a interactive map from ctv montreal if like to look at more details
wtf montreal-nord? did you really think the other was going to have the slightest thought for you?
île biz went fully coderre. this graphic is wrong.
i know someone who lives on the west island. “i don’t like plante.  she took away all the parking and now there are bikes everywhere. not safe!”
too bad your city de-merged or you could have been a part of the process to chose montréal’s mayor. ;)
i’d be curious to see this map with the % of vote that went to the candidate, like that purple map of the usa; no state was 100% red or blue.
the scale (20km) is used for what, exactly?
i see the heartland/hinterland rule is at play here.
not once have i heard someone even mention the date to vote
not at all surprised by rdp-pat and their little bubble of isolated suburbanites. they must have been the first to whine to say that "there may have been parking spaces because of all the cyclab piss osti!"
so let them stay in their damn clouds of refinery smoke ... meanwhile, the rest of the city will continue to ride in beciks to work and do errands.
edit: ah well i swallow my words. looks like projet montreal was finally elected. i am very happy.
some analysts have mentioned that the turnout is generally lower when one election comes right after another.
in this case, people are already burnt down because of the federal election.
37% 😸, 42% last time
it really didn't appeal to me, but i made an effort to help coderre get rid of again.
as someone who worked at the elections this weekend. i didnt complain about the participation as i got to do all my school work for the week + watch the whole f1 grand prix with the amount of free time we had lol. to be fair though, the process to register to vote, especially if you have recently moved or have any different circumstance is an extreme pain in the ass. i dont understand why they make you jump through so many hoops just to do your civil duty, as theyre basically convincing people that dont have unlimited free time not to come.
ben honestly a large party of the electorate is just little represented in the 3 parties which were in contention.
do you remember when ralliement pour montréal (the 4th option) merged with mouvement montreal and in the end just disappeared because instead of becoming a unifying party, mouvement montreal became a party that advocated secession with its roots? french cities. and since that moment the party has stagnated in the polls because lol montreal is not toronto.
what a big fail.
and then you have frédéric bastien who openly started to support denis coderre since he put himself before as being the only one mentioned the french fact ...
what a disaster.
the choice between the roc, the refurbished federal liberal or the municipal qs does not attract the electorate.
who remains?
gilbert thibodeau or stay at home.
lol
64% want to know nothing.
including me.. 36.1%
i felt no agony by montréal not making the playoffs. 
ultimately it's better for the recovery of the team, and we still have the voyageurs cup ahead of us, which i personally put more weight on than making the playoffs. 
that loss was win win
would’ve been nice to make the playoffs though, but yeah, nothing beats winning a trophy
i think had they won, the organization overall would get to unjustly save too much face after what's one of the worst years of their existence outside of the years the team shut down operations for various reasons. 
and really only the voyageurs cup matters to me, so that's all that counts
i really wish they’d go back to being the impact. fingers crossed whoever is the new president comes to their senses
unfortunately in saputo mind, montreal fc is important but he has his head toward bologna were the backlash of failure is bigger than here.
first the defeat of coderre and now perez ?!
party !!! 🎈🥳🎉🙌🥂*
* while respecting the sanitary rules which do not seem to apply to good old lionel).
she won fk yes fk you lionel perez hahahahhaha
i know lionel perez to be someone who ignored the health rules of the covid when they were particularly critical, so it's great that this egotist is not supported by montrealers.
what i notice above all is that sue montgomery, who has persisted in clinging to power, and has cost, to date !, $ 600,000 to taxpayers in legal fees, has not even had 10% of vote. good fucking off.
super close too! probably have a recount
no fucking way lmao
sooooo proud to be one of those votes!! hopefully it sticks after any recounts are done
as a resident of the borough, idk what to think...
perez is a smart guy with his head on his shoulders, not sure losing someone like that is a good thing considering katahwa is an unknown.
on the other hand... the less coderre the better. 
time will tell.
yesiiiiiiiii esti what beautiful news
daaaamn
the real good news is goodbye sue montgomery.
perez the fuck face # 1. fuck yes
does anyone have a map that shows who won which part of town? i'm curious to see what it looks like.
yes sir!
awesome!
it was that close, i completely forgot to vote. fortunately she won
i'm so happy hahahaha suck it coderre team, gang of big crosseurs
it's official, she is the borough mayor of cdn-ndg
this was a terrible night for coderre and ensemble montreal, first, lionel perez, the opposition chef, loses his territory, his bread and butter, karine boivin roy and guillaume lavoie, important figures in ensemble montreal, and lavoie was even considered as coderre's right hand man, lose their boroughs, and nadine gelly, who was supposed to be the president of the executive commitee, lost her district. a terrible night for ensemble montreal.
i know her personally, so happy for her, she’ll do a great job!!
100% there will be a recount.
parizeau is like the one he criticizes in the end. he tried to be opportunistic, thinking he would have more success and more power by returning to coderre (even though plante had made him a good place on the executive council). and now that he's lost, he's going on the attack instead of showing solidarity.
bye bye.
that's it, it's still the fault of ethnic votes. 😂
i can reassure you parizeau, it was not the change in his opinion in the face of law 96 that cost him 🤣
at least he didn't criticize the money and the companies lol
he is one of the most manipulative and opportunistic guys i have had the "pleasure" of meeting in my life. it disgusts me and does not surprise me to read that he covets the provincial elections. he will surf on his grandfather's name to carve out a place for himself in the pq. i just hope that people will realize that behind the smile and the nice words, there is no principle, just ambition.
thank you, the liberals, for merging montreal. otherwise we would have been caught 4 years with coderre.
yeah .. the truth is often scary (parizeau was 100% right, the * facts * showed it).
bah, not far from that haha
i was in his district before and he was very proud to strut about the rev on social networks ... until he returned with coderre and suddenly found it really dangerous.
no vision, just a filthy opportunist. good riddance.
if it goes with the pq, the problem will fix itself.
it still implies that their votes should count less than others.
he's still young lol lol
so a regular politician then
that's your interpretation, he said that the ethnic vote voted against the independence project (especially since parizeau was hot, he had fewer filters, but he was very direct, unambiguous). 😄
they shouldn't have been there to begin with
a regular politician will toe the party line (which is generally expected), but it takes another level of politician to do a 180 on issues when switching to another party. you can have a change of opinion, sure, but sometimes it's also blatantly self-serving like in this case.
no you
valérie plante coderre 2: replantage
(comment i saw on another tread)
i wonder how much this last week has hurt her with her legendary transparency. more capable
as a wise man once said :
these peas
denis is like a big cockroach. could there be a 3rd world war with montreal totally destroyed and irradiated, that he would still come back and try to cross us with his beautiful white pallets by saying: "you are going to be stuck with me!"
when does he announce he is leaving politics now?
denis goes back to your hole !!
good, will leave us alone coderre there i hope.
what a relief!
it reminds me of ferrandez's mandates in the plateau. with each election, the same old-fashioned gang of bros announced that we would finally get rid of the much-hated mayor, but in the end he increased his lead.
turns out the people of the plateau liked the pedestrian streets and the reduced traffic on the small streets.
my gut feeling is that the same shower bros gang took this election for granted, for the same reasons.
especially happy to see such a felt rejection of coderre's old-fashioned "hussle city" vision.
don't care if i have more festivals, more corporate, more this or that that won't do anything in my everyday life. i just want a livable montreal living environment. my vote therefore went to plante, by default.
as for bala-blabla, i never remember his name ... his electoral performance corresponds a lot to my self-esteem. total clown.
it's a great night for women mayors in quebec in general!
get fukt mayor quimby
denis 2.0 was the same as before, so the result is the same.
i don't know what gives me the most pleasure: the victory and plante or the defeat of coderre.
we are almost 14% different.
he must not be happy, the guy.
well at least they'll be quiet about the return of the expos boondoggle for another few years.
bye bye coderre, good riddance.
i got legit scared during this election but i'm gonna sleep well tonight.
and stronger than the last time. at least at 22:21.
the coderre team called me for a poll last week and i told them that i did not want to vote for plante, but there i had no choice, because i was not for maybe re-entering the corruption at the town hall.
bye denis! stay home next time!
what a pleasure.
best moment of the evening: the plans for the coderre party empty at 8 p.m.
as long as they improve the diversity of transport offerings, i will be satisfied
the things i want to see first.
* social housing, have a plan over a few years with realistic deliverables.
* cameras for the police, that will (maybe) solve a lot of small irritants on all sides.
* have police patrols with more social / community workers.
* improvement and optimization of infrastructure works. (like they did the asphalt before redoing the sidewalk in front of us)
* have realistic deliverables.
more bike paths
that pink line would make the east orange line that much less hellish to use
she's not going to fix the deplorable road conditions?
forget it the cameras on the police the way our justice system is made, it would take a large team that would video edit all day to make acceptable evidence (blur all unrelated faces, mute conversations) and then for the jury, they would have to type hours of videos during the trial, because you can't be selective about what you want to listen to; do you want to hear again what the dude said to the policeman? you have to replay the entire 2 hour video each time.
i think it would be dirty work and incredible expenses, but basically i'm not against it, it's just intense.
ah well, the fact that it is the least subsidized by capita, being the largest, does it bother you? coudonc
the sidewalk is certain that there is a reason and it is surely a complaint, i have seen stories like that to the point even that the owners of a house have threatened the company and the city not to started again on the new sidewalks which had cracked the following year because he did not want to have problems with the uni-stone of their driveway again.
in the end, the sidewalks remained cracked and each year the crack grew.
summer !!
they put a bike path on our residential street and it made it so much uglier and it's barely used too. there's 50 signs and metal posts in the middle, when it used to be just beautiful nature / two rows of big beautiful trees. i want to make the city more cyclist friendly too, but urban planners need to consult with architects and space designers sometimes for the visual appeal lol.
according to the city's own data, only 0.5% of ppl who commute for work, school or whatever during the week , use bikes in winter.  bikes are fun, but man it's all smoke for the masses. it's never gonna cover montréal's needs. city is big, the province is bigger and the numbers don't lie, ppl are fucking off the island at a massive rate. making it even worse while commuting from the suburbs
the pink line has priority?
is that so. should tell the town hall. and statistics.
people still believe in the pink line? cute lol.
for that, it would be necessary:
a) restrict large trucks in montreal
b) invest massively (but really massively) to redo the entire network (not just on the surface)
c) endure a lot ++ of road works
so no.
if the rumors about organized crime are true, she will never be able to significantly disrupt their business. not without mounting a massive offensive. so, if organized crime has anything to do with road conditions, no, she won't. 
although she will probably do more work on road infrastructure, particularly expanding infrastructure for bicycles and pedestrians and stuff like that.
> she's not going to fix the deplorable road conditions?
only when the commuters stop making life unpleasant for us by polluting us with their cars.
yes for bikes
they got them empiric, what do you think lol.
the cameras do not record 7/24.
companies that offer bodycams like axon also offer saas solutions to manage evidence and share it.
it lacks effects a little
i like it despite the oversaturation.
do you have the original?
why is the photo so bad? looks like it's oversaturated and the shadows are too dark?
looks like everything is on fire. can someone photoshop the dog with his coffee mug that says "this is fine" in the photo?
i love it.: - d
yes, it's oversaturated but it looks like an impressionist painting. it's beautiful fall in montreal.
my mother lived on this street younger
it's nice
wow absolutely beautiful!
fantastic to see this. my grandparents lived on rielle and i have only wonderful memories of this street.
i hope you don't mind but this is now my new phone wallpaper. ❤🧡💛
love it
woooww that's beautiful!
beautiful. simply beautiful. merci.
mainly yellow i think.
lmao
yes you are right. i have just started to practice.
[ask and you will receive] (
not at all! flattering to hear!
what does the original look like?
insertech would probably take it. 
if you're willing to drive to rosemont, there's insertech angus. they recycle computers and reinsert/give jobs people who have been down on their luck. they're on molson st, just south of st-joseph.
in most cases like this there are three capacitors on the power supply (inside of the monitor) that go bad. 
open up the monitor and then pull out the power supply (board) and you can replace the capacitors for around $10.00 (if you are ok with soldering). 
the capacitors are usualy 1000uf but range from 16v to 35v 
this youtube video covers how to do it - 
there's this group of local folks who like to fix things. can't vouch for them as i have no personal experience, but i like their idea of fixing stuff instead of throwing it out.
last time happened, i advertised it for free online. you'd be surprised at the number of people willing to pick it up for parts or trying to fix it.
any best buy or staples.
i take all my old/broken electronics to one of city's ecocenters for recycling.  (the one on st-patrick in ville lasalle.)
if you still have the monitor i'd love to try to fix it . i am in ndg also.let me know how to reach you and i will pick it up. thanks.
aha, postal code lookup, perfect! looks great, thanks.
hmmm! i took note. i may contact you in the next couple days. thanks!
it is a shame, because as much as it's a cliché, municipal elections really are the ones where your vote is most likely to matter and where the outcome is something you'll feel every day on the street or the bus or at the park. 
i think the big drop in participation is probably a one-time thing, unique to this election. i don't totally blame voters for being less interested and engaged, because it felt like a rerun of 2017, like the only thing at stake was "coderre wants his old job back; should he get it?" i'm hopeful that future elections with new candidates and new ideas on the ballot will bring a return to higher participation.
in the federal election (which was called on a whim out of nowhere), i changed my address online, received my ballot in the mail less than two weeks later and i could post it whenever i wanted.
at the municipal election (which is on a fixed date, literally giving élection montreal all the time in the world to organize something that looks good), i had to make a two hour detour after the job to go showing four retirees a hydro bill to change my address, and the mail-in vote was for red-haired one-legged people wearing mickey mouse-shaped glasses.
i wonder why the majority didn't bother.
it's sad.
i don't know how to turn the tide.
too bad, the only reason i didn't vote was that i was sure plante was going to be re-elected (and i was okay with that), but i didn't really want to vote for her anymore - \ _-
more people voted last week than this weekend lol.
so no one really cared about coderre’s tax return, it didn’t make much of a difference
for me there were too many barriers.. was told i couldn't vote because i missed the strict registration deadline for my new apartment.  i didn't realise i was still registered at my old apartment.
we should be able to register up to the last minute of voting so we can participate in the ridings we live in.  feel like i was stripped of my democratic rights ☹
normal.    
nobody gives a flying ...thought about the same old greedy politicians.     
besides they all do the same stuff: overpay the mafia for services, charge more in taxes and block even more traffic (has anyone ever removed a stop sign or increased a speed limit or allowed more street parking or removed rush hour restrictions from rich 'hoods ?)
it must be because of the covid. / s
>i don't totally blame voters for being less interested and engaged, because it felt like a rerun of 2017
there is also a fatigue linked to the federal election. (it's stupid because it's not that exhausting to go and vote 2x in 2 months, but hey).
yes of course, all the candidates for entire canada doesn't deserve a vote.
start by presenting more interesting candidates than kid kodak and hee hee hee unceded.
>more people voted last week than this weekend lol.
not true. about 12% last weekend and 24% this weekend. so no.
yeah! that's it! otherwise everyone loves politicians.
and everyone likes to pay taxes to the mafia (with an extra step of going through town hall) and having more and more traffic and parking cut off, by all the f0u7u $ of politicians.
the fatigue isn't exclusively to the act of heading to the polls but of actually informing yourself and caring about the choices you have.
it took maybe three minutes to vote ....
both are in the unceded. this is the last sentence of coderre in his speech of defeat in 2017.
> among the voters who expressed themselves during these municipal elections, 21.8% voted in advance.
i dunno, am i reading this wrong? 21.8% on 30/31st vs 35% total, which means only 13% on the 6th and 7th.
i know, but this still makes no sense for me.
but some people just dont really care about politics.
sorry, we are both kinda right. 21.8% is for all of quebec (where 40-ich % of people voted).
for montreal-only, it was 12 % last week and 22 ich this week.
you’re reading it wrong - they’re saying that of the total amount of people who voted (i.e., the 36% of montrealers that voted), 21.8% voted by anticipation. that’s 21.8% of the total 36% - in other words, about one fifth of the amount of people that voted did so by anticipation.
go plant go
thats a beautiful picture
thanks everyone. no filter added to the picture btw
that's a generic comment.
thats a useless comment. are you for real? if i liked the picture i liked the picture go mind your own gd business
you must be new around here
that's an angry reply.
however, he arrived in the countryside with the wind in his sails, but did not offer anything interesting, did not "filter" his candidates and hid his last jobs.
... and he comes whining that the countryside was "dirty". i think it's about time he put his politician's suit on for good.
fucking lol.
he was asked to be accountable and be transparent. he takes it for personal attacks.
he complains that the election is a referendum on his personality, but he barely had an electoral platform to defend.
pathetic. good riddance.
he didn't like being asked about his shady things.
that he makes projection this corrupt loser estie.
with all the bourgeois media that he gave him a huge advantage, he was not able to avoid being a big condescending bastard for the last few weeks. sucks to suck
it is sure that it is dirty to be called out for problematic candidates. i guess it should have just been said nothing.
and he is the reason, his campaign can be summed up in this: "plant is horrible, chuis better, vote for me". if he didn't spend his entire campaign constantly criticizing plante, maybe he would have better results.
he's the one who is filthy, the journalists and plante just put it forward.
we remember that he started his campaign by saying that plante = trump (because of the non-postal votes decided by the clerk), or even that she is the friend of the gangs (because of prosper).
anyway, fuck you denis is going home and staying there
it's a bit of a sore loser
denis this morning: “you are going to be dragging with me”
i guess it’s nice, coderre is consistently inconsistent. wonder if he’ll finally retire..
it is true that i find it not clean.
so, are you going to do his orange dictator and bawl that the election was stolen from him?
i found his ridiculous "better to have regrets than remorse." i have neither regret nor remorse ”. it doesn't mean anything, my bunny. even in defeat, he is arrogant.
go back to the private sector to make 400k per year and stop complaining.
still incredible how stingy some are with power
demi coderre is condescending to the death and never accepted defeat at the hands of plante the first time around.
he deserved his steal.
the voters said: "we don't like the old coderre and we don't like the new coderre".
he said yesterday that it was a magnificent campaign while he eats shit.
i am a loser ...
i think he's the one who's dirty. i would even go so far as to say that it is osti of big corrupted dung.
my dear denis, if you read this go to the office to get your personal effects. ciao.
fuck you denis
i love the style, it makes me want to take a walk in the morning!
gorgeous!
this is amazing!
beautiful photo ✨👌
that's most definitely not a photo though. (but yes, it's beautifully done)
it is indeed a drawing on a tablet!
yeah i think he said that as a compliment
having said that, it's wonderful op
for information, in the center of the photo above the two towers, we see the moon and venus.
the city, by night, by far, is more beautiful than any christmas decoration
great pic! 👍👍👍
nice.
patow 👌
definitely not a title from someone driving there.
valérie plants coderre
31.7% of people voted, that's just sad.
i voted in 2017 for plante to release coderre. this year i don't want him to come back, and i voted accordingly.
plante ahead by 7pp and no votes counted in the plateau yet. it's very early but i wouldn't want to be at coderre's party right now
with montreal, longueuil and quebec, it seems a beautiful evening for the mayors
get your, coderre!
10 points of difference. ultimately holness will not have tipped the scales one way or the other. a chance.
projet montréal also seems to have a majority on the city council. 33 of the 65 seats are needed and they are currently at 35.
valérie plante re-elected, and projet montréal majority.
[excellent!](
holness which revolves around 7%. but where is this wave that the world advocated? ;)
take my energy 🪴
🚲🚲🚲🚲🚲🚲🚲
radio-canada just called it for valerie plante (and quebec also has a new lady mayor!)
[radio-canada announces plante's re-election at 9:04 pm] (
rc affirms that plante is re-elected mayor!
phew !!!
the most important result of the evening: finally we will hear more talk of politics during a criss de boutte. the federal election followed by the municipal election, chu tanned in tabarnak, freeze me peace.
we come back to the good old posts: what is your favorite park in montreal?
radio-canada has just declared valérie plante elected.
lol the bitching on facebook is great.
congratulations to the newly elected mayors
cbc has it [here](
na na na na, na na na, hey hey hey, good bye!
perez can take my breath away. good to meet him in the street.
the samuel-de is hiding the champlain.
wow, beautiful shot!
that looks better than the led strip behind my tv! c’est beau!
mario kart bridge
great photo :)
wander how long it will take to fix that broken section with no lights.
thank you for the gold!!!
new champlain iz best champlain!
thank you! i was surprised that my cellphone was able to take such a nice shot. i tried one of downtown too, from the same place, but unfortunately that one came out very washed out and blurry as the phone's camera was struggling to get enough light.
on sunday nights they have the rainbow bridge lights moving just like in mario kart
i like this.
and montreal needs even more public art.
to my knowledge, the land is at the cp and not at the city.
i found [an article from 2017 which talks about the situation at this time] ( -piste-cyclable-des-carees /). i don't know how it evolved.
> the borough of rosemont-la-petite-patrie will study a motion on friday asking the city of montreal to acquire the multifunctional path that runs along rue des carrières.
> the bike path, owned by the canadian pacific (cp) railway company, was leased for approximately $ 300,000 per year to the city of montreal.
> "the lease expired two years ago and the conditions set by the cp mean that there is currently no agreement," said françois croteau, mayor of the borough.
> according to information obtained by mayor croteau, the cp would now ask for a rental fee of $ 1m per year, and would require the city to repair the holes in the fence, cut by citizens wanting to cross the railroad, and the closure from the 3.4km track in winter.
better not. a gravel path requires so little maintenance. paving (as we build them here, as cheap * as possible) will crack all over the place after five years and become dangerous for cyclists.
as others have mentioned, it's not (only) a bike path, and it's good for runners to have a gravel trail.
ask your elected officials who will be elected tonight?
more important question:
why pave it? apart from winter cycling, i see no reason
they prefer not to pave it because they fear that cyclists will go too fast if it is paved and that would be detrimental to the cohabitation of different types of user. at least that's what i read 3-4 years ago.
no plans to my knowledge, but note that this is not just a cycle path, it is a multi-functional track:
i guarantee you that the hundreds of runners who use this gravel track are also very happy for their knees.
or - i throw an idea in the air, like that - we could refrain from cementing everything to promote infiltration and runoff, limit the increase in heat islands, preserve a jogging track that does not smash the floor. spine and knees by offering better damping, and among other things saving the municipal budget by avoiding having to redo the concrete every 3 years.
at the same time, i know it's heartbreaking, it's a missed opportunity for montreal's * family * cheap cement industry. it is heartbreaking.
i hope not! the career path is good as it is
this track is quite correct. the real problem is the arrangements for crossing the railway line. the z on st-urbain / clarck gives the impression that we are kidding you, the one on du parc gives the impression that someone wants to kill you, and i would probably have things to say if rockland , papineau and lorimier were on my daily path.
they should instead illuminate it adequately at night, especially for the section between the incinerator and papineau.
it's good that we leave places in cities with little development, rather than concrete everything. this route is also used a lot (even mostly) by runners and pedestrians.
as much as i like gravel, i like less the countless holes filled with water after a downpour and some places are also very slippery due to the soaked earth. i think we can find a compromise between unmaintained path and paving. incidentally, the lighting also leaves much to be desired. in short, this very useful route lacks a little love.
personally i concede that it has drawbacks to ride in the garnotte, but damn that i don't like asphalt ...
why exactly?
she is very good like that.
the trail (never been able to consider it a bike path) has been in terrible shape since i was little / as far back as i can remember. after over thirty years, i honestly wouldn't have hope.
to worsen the runoff of rainwater or to extend the heat island over a few kilometers?
should not. this is my favorite bike path.
why?
subscriber! i like any discussion about the infrastructure of the bicycle.
our former mayor did the math already:
pragmatic: 98% cars
dogmatic: 95% cars
i am so weirded out by "plateau-ization" being used to express a fear when it comes to transit. i understand there may exist a link between being more bike friendly and gentrification, however that is more correlation than causation. and for sure, bike infrastructure should be a staple \*not\* a luxury, just like tree cover: poor people are entitled to these things just as much!
whose street is it? to us the street!
2.5% is not 1/25th! it's 1/40th. (2'00" - 2'15")
you'll love not just bikes if you don't already know.
this channel is honestly great. they're not exclusively montreal focused, but they often use it as an example and have lots of great footage.
that part says that 2.5% is 1/25th of 63%.
hah, i know the channel well. i am addicted to these things. now i have a channel for one of my favorite cities.
thanks for sharing the channel. i don't know how it happened, but over the course of the pandemic, i've been watching almost exclusively urban planning infrastructure youtube channels.
then thank you for the correction and apologies for the complaint.
not just bikes is so good.
i was so happy that the report shows the corner of rue st-hubert / st-antoine. i live next door and it really took me a long time to figure out that even if there is a pedestrian light, it never turns on! so you can wait your turn like a turkey before you realize the city doesn't care that you're on foot.
generally speaking, this corner, st-antoine and viger opposite, it's very dangerous. people are always over the speed limit because they are going to take the 720 or they are coming, and they are crying to realize that there are lights and pedestrians. i have so often come close to being killed by motorists who pass close to burning their lights. it would really take speed bumps to make it clear that the highway starts further away.
also, if you get caught in bus traffic, there is a problem.
heil, i hope you went to vote!
"it's great the gang" 🤣
that last line got me.
eric bousquet was too busy figuring out what negative / crime news to post in the two sub next week.
i see you went to vote 😌
> “it was a magnificent campaign, we had a lot of time to get our messages across. yesterday again, i saw seven districts, ”says the politician.
even when he compliments himself he's not believable. magnificent countryside? oh denis if you only knew
yes, we will be pushing to see it again in 2025.
so arrogant ...
aged like milk.
he really doesn't sound confident. he knows how to fuck journalists though
bye bitch!
who is this guy?
well, that didn't age well!
criiiiiinggggeeeee
criss, i envy the quebec elections. several games and it's going to be tight.
here in montreal, it's going to be ugly one way or another: /
do you think his ego would survive a second defeat? it would surely be a fairly easy fruit to harvest, but boy, it would be strange to see him try again.
or push the spvm to spy on them and intimidate them when they investigate him.
it will be uneasy in the sacrament

here is the french version (which is unfortunately more difficult to read): 
how is it more difficult to read?
the angle in my opinion is really weird and makes orientation difficult.
but it's a question of personality, i guess 🤔
i think it was just not very clear that it was about the interactive map and not the text. :)
great shot, i have never seen beaver lake from this perspective.
[deleted]
crazy photo
great perspective!
 but there are no beavers and it's not a lake. discuss.
seen from belverdère kondiaronk.
great shot. unusual angle of montreal as well.
beautiful! beaver lake was always my favourite place to see the colours in the fall.
amazing, where was this taken from?
wow! thank you for this photo really a beautiful perspective of this place
spent most of my early childhood around that lake.
there are no beavers at that lake🥲
how far from downtown montreal?
thank you! :)
with the saint joseph's oratory!
and mount royal is hardly a mountain.
there used to be beavers!
thank you! 
i took this with a drone (dji mini 2) about 120m up from the park.
and hardly royal
volcanic intrusion actually, like the other 6 in the area like mont st bruno,etc
your shot got me hyped to have a drone, ~~do you need any drone pilot license~~ to fly the mini or the weight make it all good?  
edit: nevermind i found the info, you don't .
did you just make me give richard martineau a click?
we really have to stop this kind of analysis.
denis had (as usual) a bad campaign but plante has a lot of merits too.
of course, a guy like martineau is incapable of saying that, but that is the reality.
we have to believe that we are not 'stuck with' yet.
fully agree. i almost have the impression that coderre did not campaign except to put his feet in his mouth: /
but "the" elections were in quebec yesterday !!!
seriously this year's municipal elections were really interesting.
can't wait to see the turnout ?? !!
ouache, richard martineau.
i'll save you a click, it's an article by martineau.
wow richard martineau has an opinion of marde? who knew.
i really wish he would get deplatformed, he really useless at least and damaging at most.
> we were fed up with its cycle paths and pedestrian streets ...
i can't anymore with these... stfu. you're noise richard, that's all you are.
apart from the first debate on tva where plante was much too aggressive, each time these two were on the same set, coderre was no match.
can we have a richard martineau / sophie flair to avoid giving them clicks? thank you.
> there were so few people at the polling station in my area that i felt like i was participating in a school election!
good one
no matter who won or who lost, we got away with it and it's a damn good riddance criss!
in montreal ?!
or overall??
i didn't know the numbers were out yet.!
i will google it;))
i'll save you a click, he rewrites the subject in different ways for 3 paragraphs
and you just warned a click from me. thanks to you!
turn out rate was like 36%, so less than 2017 and probably the lowest in history.
even a broken watch ...
les pistes cyclables et les rues piétonnières were exactly why plante got re-elected. it’s why pm enjoys such a large majority in the boroughs that are directly affected by bike paths and pedestrian streets. the idea that a majority of montrealers hate them is a myth cooked up by right-wing media trolls like martineau and that idiot who runs the suburban. 
maybe a majority of *suburbanites* hate the bike paths and pedestrian streets but they don’t live here so who cares. (actually, maybe that’s a myth too because longueuil and laval both elected new mayors that have more in common with plante than coderre.)
nah, he's right on this one, coderre lost.
in three different ways, he talks about the same subject in the same number of paragraphs. it'll save you a click.
/jk
i have no problem with the facts, it's his opinion i hate.
léché dessert, the beignerie, trou de beigne, lucky's donut (at the 49th parallel in the old mtl)
beignes colonial. alot of creamy filling.
krispy kreme 👀
wawel bakery. corner sherbrooke and girouard. amazing polish donuts.
léché desserts
wawel
crémy has some that are not to be missed, but also a few that should be avoided.
the good ones: homer, lemon, maple, and boston.
the bad ones: crème brûlée, "cheesecake", and carrot cake.
i miss the little donuts from boris sur parc.
léché desserts, despite their customer service which sometimes leaves a lot to be desired: /
panda donuts in sainte-anne-de-bellevue.
bernie are the best! seriously, look no further and go back to bernie's. otherwise you will be disappointed.
a difficult choice between trou de beigne and donuts for me. when i buy a dozen or two from donations for my team at work it's always all the rage.
sad but bernie donuts is the best haha !! i tried a couple of them but bernie is hard to beat!
the best donuts in montreal are those who voted for coderre 😁
bernie donut went against the $ 5 donut shop wave and opted for a popular donut instead. always a line, always hot, always the right price and always good.
mckiernan luncheonette on st-patrick
boss donuts
krispy kreme (hot now original glaze) in rive-sud
the donut shop! follow on insta they say when they are out of stock, it often happens on weekends
if you're close to verdun, choco locco isn't donuts, it's waffles, but it's sick. fresh waffle made with fruit, chocolate, cookies, ice cream ... worse the owner is very meticulous, you see that he wants to give quality to customers.
for or against getting permanent residents to vote in municipal elections?
7 years that i live here and the delays are long and it is frustrating not yet being able to choose your mayor or mayoress.
fyi: the reminder card is optional. i didn't receive it (or accidentally threw it away i guess) and was able to vote anyway. as long as you are registered you should be fine!
> voting is important. this is what makes it possible to collect the garbage, plug the holes in the streets and lay out cycle paths.
will voting for dénis coderre make it possible to draw cycle paths?
i'm going to have a hard time not piercing the paper of enthusiasm by voting plante. see you never coderre!
i work as an election secretary in rosemont, come and go
i voted (p'tit)!
browse all the municipal election posts [here]( (along with some federal elections, we apologize)
how do i know if i'm registered, i haven't received a ti-papier?
\ * little old people ** who did not apply their obvious denture glue correctly. **
obviously, it's denture glue. oh! you put that in your mouth and your dentures take off more, no no!
"you can vote all the end of the week": unless like me you tested positive for covid after october 27, the deadline for voting by email. really not strong not to have thought of this scenario, election montreal ....
(and yes, i am vaccinated at 2 doses)
why can we vote for two days but at the federal level for only one day? i just realized that and i don't understand why it's not the other way around.
i didn't realize you are asked to bring your own pen/pencil! thanks for the heads up.
i voted for valerie plante, sue montgomery and speed mcqueen.
like i get it that reddit skews young and plante skews younger than coderre considerably, but the sheer hate for coderre in this sub is quite entertaining. i'm far from being a big fan of the guy, and have zero qualm with plante getting re-elected, but reading posts here you'd think coderre is basically trump in canada lol.
so if i didn't register last week i can't vote?
i bet there will be less than 40% turnout.
so will it be a turd or a shit sandwich?
let’s go dennis coderre !!!
personally i am for the right to vote of any resident of the city, regardless of status and citizenship with regard to municipal elections. do you work and live here? you can vote.
and against the right to vote for people who do not live in the city but who own property there, in particular home owners.
i am in the same situation. yes the deadlines are long, but after 7 years, if you do everything really quickly as soon as you have the right, you are a citizen :) it is a bit like us who are slow ... normally i get it there 'next year \ * fingers crossed \ *

maison de the cha noir in verdun has a wide variety of teas and has been open for 20 years.
asiatica on parc/sherbrooke intersection! they are a small family-owned business.
also, myamoto ( victoria st , westmount) has japanese tea 
and all of the other answers
many places in chinatown have actual chinese teas (camelia sinensis = black/green/white tea as well as herbals).     
ask around there or ask any chinese friend or coworker.
i would not recommand paying top dollars for top quality tea, unless you know they have a good rolling and you are not paying for something that is on the shelves for months: this is not like coffee where you can trace the origins of your product and get a roasting date, so even if it might be better than "regular tea", you are still paying top dollars for a not so top quality, which imo is not the best thing. 
but some places will give you nice information regarding the origin and traceability on top products. just look for teas with high rolling and go for them. 
camellia sinensys might be the only place you are looking for.
china town
seconding camellia sinensis. great teas they buy from small producers, and they know what they're selling as well. they have teapots and gaiwans, which are nice and expensive. if you're looking for serviceable and cheap, head to chinatown.
the owner came to do a presentation in one of my classes in uni many years ago, spoke about his procurement process. i was sold then and there, had never even tried his tea before. they go (or used to, don't know if they still do) on site in china to check the tea producers themselves. worth the steep price.
thanks! will check it out!
> nonetheless, experts told the washington post that the un climate summit negotiations had a real impact on climate predictions. during the paris agreement, signed in 2015, the united nations predicted that the temperature on earth would warm by 4 ° c by 2100. today, these forecasts are 2.7 ° c, a figure that is still catastrophic. and very far from the target of 1.5 ° c set out in the paris agreement.
oh wow yeah in that case, these summits are super helpful! thanks for setting me straight, experts!
stop eating meat people.
i can't understand why there were so few of us.
directly on the unceded territory of valérie plante!
no.
there wasn't a lot of publicity for the walk, not many people knew there was one
because we have other things to do on a saturday afternoon.
i had not heard of it before this thread
+1 i had absolutely no knowledge of this gathering, i would have come otherwise.
i also have a lot of other things i could do, but i don't think there are many more important.
it seems like homard plus closed in 2011 and was replaced by a place called masaya, a lebanese and mediterranean restaurant that was very poorly reviewed and closed in 2016. it was seemingly replaced by a seafood restaurant called la table du pêcheur, which closed in 2018. it appears to be empty now.
so, either it was there before the homard plus or it's the wrong address.
i've lived near little italy since before 2011 and there are a lot of places where you can get spaghetti vongole currently and in the past. 
10500 gouin ouest is a one-storey, isolated building surrounded by parking. is that what he remembers? if so, could he be confusing it with another similar building?
does he remember anything else? 
ps i'm sorry i didn't answer in french but it's getting late and writing in french without making tons of mistakes costs me a lot more mental effort.
you can try your hand with the google maps street view history
maybe go and see the land register?
it is a lebanese who replaced the lobster more, not an italian.
what year approximately?
i think you could do a search here [land register] (
he needs to get some!!
so you want shitty sea food?
oh, some of my sources:
[
[
[
[
you can see that the google street view photos go back to 2011, when the sign was covered up, but if you look at the second sign (on the large display, not on the building itself) you can see that it's the homard plus logo that is covered up. in the next google photo, it's masaya and then, eventually, la table du pêcheur. and, in 2021, the building is unoccupied.
there was also a fisherman's table in little italy, at the corner of st-laurent / st-zotique. it has been closed for a couple of years and is now a st-houblon. maybe that's it.
the land was sold to a developer in 2019, a zoning change notice sign announcing condos went a long way in 2019-2020 in front of the building. according to the city's assessment roll, it belongs to "les immeubles mqp", a numbered company in laval.
ps: at the beginning of the 80s, it was a "la crèpe bretonne". it seems to me that there was a greek restaurant at one time?
here are 2 photos of the lobster plus late 80s, early 90s (the shopping center behind was still there!).

i was just thinking it would take me a way to go back in time hahaha
i try, thank you!
in the last 5 years, let's say?
why are you so salty in life? who hurt you?
not sure i'm following, we're looking for the italian restaurant that took the place after homard-plus
i see!
it's true! i had forgotten.
you can go back in time in street view. in the box at the top left you can choose a date. i see that at this address in 2014 there was a masaya restaurant
welcome! this is a question that challenged me pcq i live in an area where businesses follow one another at the same addresses at a rather breathtaking pace and i have already wondered if there was some kind of database that allows you to keep thread. also i looked for the address you give in google earth to see if there would be any images that date a bit and no, nothing before august 20, 2019 ...
beautiful hotel, piece of shit video cobbled together from a dozen other (probably better) videos
the beef wellington at bar george is so good.

some people have to much time on their hands.
for the moment!
chicago! come for the willis tower, stay because you got murdered!
chicago is actually not in the top 20 cities in the us for per-capita murder . it's just the largest city with a high rate.
chicago is not actually one of the 20 american cities with the highest murder rates per capita. it's just the biggest city that has a high rate.
much less people.
i would be mad tho paying a frog half a billion
canadian gun laws aren't that great , registering guns is absolutely stupid and there should be more check ups on people before allowing them to buy and use guns. as a hunter since i was a kid , i am well educated about guns and think that if more people were , the fear of guns would be much lesser. a sharp knife is as dangerous as a gun , sorry not sorry
this chart was created for /r/mls for fun.
it was shared elsewhere after.
it's a completely arbitrary selection, and it happens to be one that excludes the five worst cities in the us.
in a couple of years, st louis will be added to that list, and their #1 rate of 66/100k would be quite an outlier.
of course these rates aren't really comparable anyway, since they're using municipal boundaries where some cities include huge suburban sprawl and others are limited to the city core.
the second survey where plante overtakes coderre, but this is not an invitation to stay at home.
vote this weekend
plant coderre 2 plant: replanting
don't let the boomers re-elect coderre
i hope plante wins and we never hear from coderre again
lol, the margin of error for this survey of 515 respondents is 4.3% 19 times out of 20, while the difference between the two parties would be 5% ...
this election is already quite confusing without being obliged to add the mottons of the jdm!
it's still interesting when you compare the polls on qc125 [ marge( it's almost the same scenario as in 2017.
coderre can’t run a campaign worth shit.
gazette is reporting as of 4pm turnout is 31.7% lol
we will see in ... [checks watch] 20 minutes !!
it's sad that such an inept mayoress wins because she happens to be the less corrupt of the two candidates ...
if you look at the polls, it's a lot more of an anglo / franco question than boomer / x.
pcq do you really think that the fate of the elections is in the hands of the boomers only ?? 😂😂😂
internet surveys are not probabilistic, so it is impossible to calculate the margin of error. if you want to do that kind of analysis, he uses the mainstreet poll that came out two days ago, which gave plante a 6-point lead with a 3-point margin of error (and he says that a result is statistically significant when the error bars of two results overlap by less than 25 percent).
what's most interesting is the trend, the trend is clearly on valérie plante, when you have two polls declaring plante the likely winner as election weekend approaches, that's usually a good sign. for projet montreal.
what do the anglos like about coderre? i don't catch.
i am sure that the real division is the relation to the use of the car (usefulness vs dependence)
there are not enough anglos to elect the mayor.
do you mean allophones too?
i can’t speak for others, but as an anglo, i cannot stand coderre and want nothing more than for him to just disappear
anglo here, dont like that guy at all.
baseball and light up the bridges?
it puts montreal on the map!
(argument from my ex pro-coderre)
hope the entrepreneur has good insurance!
in the building that was demolished there was a la traite snack that i really liked.
it's the same as super sex
québécor owned the building?
no, i think it belongs to the chagnon family, founder of videotron
according to the role of eval of the city the owner of 682 - 696 rue sainte-catherine ouest is 9189-9294 quebec inc.
worse, it cost them $ 720,000 in taxes annually!
inside there is a plaque with the name of andré changnon and his wife ... i will take a closer look at the next shot that i will pass by but i think it is a foundation for the arts or something like that
and it's on bleury not ste cat ... you are talking about the super sex club
yeah i know, but the theater problems were caused by some excavation work on the next lot. hence my comment on insurance
municipal elections in mtl are really interesting. in most parts of the city, you have a vote for mayor, for borough mayor, and for councillor. some places also have separate borough councillors and ville marie's borough mayor is also the city's overall mayor.
the mayor of montreal is elected through popular vote. this means that if valarie plante gets the most votes across the city, she is reelected as mayor. there isn't an electoral college or a "parliament" system where projet needs to win a majority of seats. a mayor can technically be elected by popular vote while their party can lose every other seat they run for. that's unlikely, but it can happen.
but even if a mayoral candidate loses, they might still serve on council. each of the big mayoral candidates (plante, coderre, holness) have "co-candidates". this means that if they do not get elected mayor but their co-candidate wins the race they're running in, they can still serve on city council. coderre's co-candidate is running for council in montreal-nord, holness' is running for councillor in peter-mcgill, and plante's is running in sainte-marie. 
borough mayors lead their borough council, which deals with specific issues for each community. the mayor of cdn-ndg for example will oversee the council that manages snow removal and garbage collection and infrastructure upgrades in their neighbourhood. they also serve on montreal's overall city council. city councillors do the same, serving on both their borough council and the city's overall council. borough councillors (like the three that are elected in the plateau or the four elected in outremont) only serve on the borough council. that's why there are 103 offices being elected, but only 65 of them will serve on montreal city council.
honestly, as an ontarian who spent 4 years in mtl, i like that system a lot better than our sad, dysfunctional city councils.
did you vote? if you did you should have seen that you vote for 3 separate persons: borough mayor, city mayor and city councillor.
the only exception would be in ville-marie, where the city mayor is the borough mayor.
trial by combat
if you want to know more about the election and how montréal politics work (in both french and english) : 
a certain few make a ring of salt and candles and we chant "who's the new mayor" as we bleed a goat hanging in the center of the ring. when the goat stops moving we pour bleach into the blood and then take a negative photo of the stain.
we then cover the walls with the negative photos in a room full of monkeys and leave them for 48 hours while the "counts" happen and hang photos of the candidates hanging in the middle of the room strung by virgin girls braids. when we arrive later, the picture with the most poop thrown at it wins and we build a great shrine to the winner in the "tunnnels" going into the river valley and we live there in complete darkness untill the next election.
the mayor is the rare option where it is directly by popular vote. 
you could theoretically have a mayor with councillors not in the same party.
depending on the borough you have between 2 and 5 seats to fill , so 2 to 5 votes
5 votes for me here in verdun:
by not voting for denis coderre.
there’s a conclave
voting coderre wastes your vote.
fptp .. first passed the post
impressive knowledge for a fairly recent transplant. i think most montrealers don’t even know their municipal political system as well !
that's a great answer, thanks for thr knowledge!
thank you! what a great answer!
haven't yet, going in an hour, hence why i asked.....
cheers
we vote 4 times in some neighborhoods: city mayor, borough mayor, city councilor, borough councilor!
people in ville marie get shafted so bad, a vote is basically meaningless and has no influence.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
you are amazing 👏 😍
only one of them is for mayor right?

they make them in whatever color you pay for.
unbelievable that the candidates promised more police officers rather than more social workers / street workers
the police brotherhood will tell its members to vote one way of the other. social workers don't have an apparatus like the police brotherhood to support their interests so politicians can ignore them more easily.
facebook does a pretty average anti-disinformation job in english and it's worse in other languages.
john oliver made a video that addresses the subject (and misinformation in the diasporas in the united states) three weeks ago: 
according to la presse, it is a murder followed by a suicide.
it's horrible !!
why does the mention that one of the victims is the son of the owner of fairmount bagel .. ?? it seems like a completely inappropriate detail.
it was only presumed that it was a murder suicide at first glance. 
he was not married or in a relationship. 
news media should never publish assumptions without making it very clear that that’s all they are. 
maybe they were killed by someone else?
maybe a robbery gone wrong? etc....
all my sympathies to the families and loved ones of both victims.
if st. viateur bagels weren’t already better…
damn, so this is really trash! horrible!
all the articles i've found said the woman is unidentified and that he wasn't married or in a couple and that both bodies had several wounds. why is everyone jumping to femicide/suicide?
very sad news whether it was murder or murder-suicide
sincere condolences to irwin and his family, they must be heartbroken
condolences seems like such an empty word to use in this situation....
another lovely marital murder suicide.
and people wonder why i'm forever single. fuck that!
there is a bagel mafia too?
radio-canada has just said that the man found dead is the son of the owner of fairmount bagels. no idea of the relevance of specifying that on the news.
[deleted]
[deleted]
yes. the newspaper this morning murder followed by suicides. horrible and not really more information than that? who was the female victim? we don't talk about it. yet it is still femicide violence. strange
we don't know the whole story yet.
edit: ok it seems like a murder / suicide. it is indeed horrible.
your comment would perhaps hold if we lived in a world where information networks were intended to inform and not generate clicks. the sad truth is that they included this information in the title because so many people know about fairmont bagels, so more people will want to read the article and therefore more ad revenue $$$ for vat.
i mean, check what [the "news" looks like these days] ( ... compared to that, l the vat article is not that bad in terms of relevance.
last week a guy killed his girlfriend on milton street ........ 4 hours later we had the names of the 2 people ... here it's been 5 days and the name of the 25-year-old girl is still unknown
some people just don't have a sense of humour.
yes ......but they’re not so .....
[la presse] ( -un-murder-followed-by-suicide.php) is reporting it as a murder-suicide.
oops ... can't wait to see what ** lie ** denis is going to make us swallow to get out of this one!
fuck coderre. surely there is no other choice than miranda.
it is more miranda, miranda was anti-coderre in the last elections it is he who this time sided behind coderre following the problems with projet montreal for snow removal or even the nature park and the metropolitan golf course.
fun fact: this station is made like this because it was the ramp for vehicles when the original metro system was built.

great photo op, looks just like i remember it 30 years ago.
down looking up
look at the angle of the lightbulbs
i suspect that the crowd of people on the right indicate a train that has just discharged a group. also the angle of the person closest to us would be very strange if we were looking up. therefore i think we are looking down. but it's really hard to tell and i am less than certain.

personally, everyone talks about a bubble, but i feel like it's more of a cyst. it keeps swelling if you do nothing and it won't fart on its own, it's going to take surgery.
what should worry people more than house prices is this:
[
real estate is made the economic sector ** # 1 ** in canada. by a huge margin! and that is scary. the day the bubble breaks, canada is in deep trouble and not nearly. the debt to gdp ratio will explode and canada will implode.
but as long as the bubble does not blow, it will become more and more impossible to find housing.
according to the assignment there is just 3 months of inventory on the market, it is really really little.
[
that's a really weird headline. "sales are down" (because supply is low and prices keep going up)
nice, hopefully prices actually go down. 
im in the market for multi family and small apartment buildings and the list prices are just ridiculous. ex asking 1m for 30k revenue what do i do with this pay the tenants to live there?
single family price inflation is just ridiculous, i wont touch that market.
no kidding!
[deleted]
looks to me like it's been on the market longer than that. after 1.5m, a little boomer style, no basement and a bathroom with questionable taste, it's still a bit expensive. having said that, they could just be patient and wait for her to leave at 1.5m.
fyi, a new construction on berri started at 1.78m a few months ago if i'm not mistaken, on a plot of land the size of a bathtub and with a vis-à-vis hell. ontario plaque parked in front. house apparently more or less empty.
montreal real estate has a bright future ahead of it.
on henri-julien!
as i walked past, i asked my friend to guess the sale price. she didn't believe me when i told her how much it was posted.
same in côte saint-paul - duplex at $ 1.75m, freaked out in 6 months, purchase price $ 700k…
pcq the agents will not go and show it pcq they will not make their cut. so its reduced the pool of customers.
there is a thing about duproprio: you pay a flat fee for listing for a certain amount of time.  the most expensive option is no time limit - you stay on the market until it is sold.  but what happens if you list, and then things change and you don't want to sell anymore.  but you already paid and you might want to sell at some point in the future.  if you take if off the market, you just lose whatever you paid.  so not all the prices you see at duproprio are the prices people expect.  some just expect to sell sometime in the distant future and not be bothered with calls in the meanwhile.
so satisfying!
exactly. these headlines are completely uninterpretable if we do not say the cause of the decrease. there is nothing on the market right now.
why did you have to put this image in my head, it's disgusting
we have two choices to make things go crazy.
either we stop with urban sprawl and therefore less construction therefore more price pressure and at a given moment people will be able to buy more therefore pow
or slow down immigration extremely bcp which would mean that there will be quietly more availability in homes with an aging population
food for thought
no. on the contrary. the decrease in the number of sales is because there are fewer properties for sale; this is not a sign that the prices will go down.
> more than a third of the income generated by training, that is to say 135 million, comes in fact from a “plan for the recovery of the city's finances”. the group also figures at seven million potential income related to a "red tape reduction plan". however, this financial framework never explains how the party would compensate for the 289 million in income from the welcome tax, which mr. coderre plans to abolish.
damn that i can't wait for this to end, it looks like a parody.

doesn't matter unless you release your tax returns and all your possible conflicts of interest.  otherwise how do voters tell if you will personally benefit from the policies.

how much was the pink line supposed to cost?
> but what do we care if it is hot in the parking lot of the galleries of anjou ... it is in the dense areas * where the world lives * that you have to work.
so agree. living in the east, i often go to the anjou galleries, and although this is my "corner" i would much prefer that something else be improved than this big parking lot there. it will take a lot to transform this kind of place there into something other than a development that follows the old model of the suburbs, we might as well put our efforts elsewhere where it will have more impact.

news flash: he won’t abolish it
bwoah tse, we are able to chew gum, walk, and find 289 million at the same time.
i think she always knew it was 100% of the mard the pink line.
she knew that she could point the finger at the provincial level and blame them that it didn't happen when in reality she knew perfectly well that it was a far-fetched project and pitched in a hurry in the purest tradition of the montreal project.
nothing pentoute: the provincial had already called her a madwoman's cristie, and had disengaged from everything at the announcement of this electoral promise even before she was elected.
pamal did the same thing during the first wave of the pandemic, when she developed her cycle paths with millions of dollars, before turning around and asking for funding from the provincial government in order to support her struggling businesses even in the midst of them. taxes of quebecers.
many thick people still wonder why legault is stuck in montreal ...
no he just said how much he earned in "income".
i always had the impression that the pink line was "symbolic" to underline: look, need a diagonal solution (lachine to rdp). would it be a metro, rem or tram? who knows?
that's how i saw him personally.
the pink line would have been great, but in 2017 (and 2021), i mostly voted for the candidate who puts public transport in the foreground
no, it was not symbolic at all.
we were talking very clearly about a metro, at least for the majority, and we were talking about a sort of two-level tunnel boring machine, it was most certainly underground. without a doubt.
it must be said that she proposed this before the 2018 election which put in power a caq which is opposed to montreal.
fortunately covid has put us back on the map! yeah!
another great demonstration that our legal system works ...
holy shit i knew him
poor girl, are you going to have to change province / country to be safe?
it does not say that his ex caught cheating on him with his best friend / godfather of his daughter for example.
that in no way excuses what he did, but when there was money, she threatened to call the police and say he sells drugs ...
emotional abuse is no better, in short.
add our mental health system to your comment. seems like this dude needs mental health treatment and soon. brava to his ex-girlfriend. sending her good vibes and positive thoughts
there are cases heavier than others, regardless of who is going to take care of them.
i can understand why you stopped knowing him!
hey, i knew him too!
threatening to report a crime to the police is far from psychological violence.
getting arrested for a crime is the logical consequence of the crime. the whistleblower does nothing wrong 🤷
edit to add: he caught his ex trying to "cheat"? if it was her ex, it was therefore not "cheating" ... the relationship was over, she owed him nothing especially considering that it had ended in violence.
i want a pic of the chix in the mirror
yeah. he was a friend of a friend like 10 years ago. he was a loser like smoking weed all day, tagging, drugs, pretty sure he was dealing. but holy shit i’m like kind of shocked, i never expected to know an (attempted) murderer. i think he has a kid too, the fucking asshole. i guess he seemed harmless because he’s like 5'4 and probably 120 lbs.
his girlfriend in time.
when you poke someone in the wrong and rather than take the blame you turn it on him, yes, that's emotional abuse. downvote all you want
bro, we might actually know each other. 
but yeah, he does have a kid, used to be a shitty tagger as well.
5p4 lolwtf
everyone in jail is 5'4".
there's a guy who was nicknamed "andre" ( for andré the giant.)
he's 5'9"
edit: oompa loompa deepeedeedoo
oh yeah , she picked a winner.....
sorry but a guy who kills his ex pcq she cheated on him, it's pathetic as fuck. pti guy not know how to manage his emotions? awh
after we say that women are too emotional lol

we might!! this actually kind of has me fucked up a little lol. i’ve sat with him so many times getting drunk back then, it’s such a bizarre feeling.

how many stm employees does it take to replace a light?
without jokes, we understand that the lights are high and difficult to access but it would be good to replace those that are blown once in a while.
such a beutiful picture
wait- has that station always looked like that? i can't tell since it's been years since i when to that station.
meh. it was beautiful 50 years ago
we can see it anyway but it blends into the composition!
with an iphone and are ultra wide angle
totally agreed 😍👌
if she is victorious i hope coderre will disappear from the public space for good.
yes miss, let's go valérie!
just a little reminder, during the last 4 years there has been no corruption scandal within the project montreal party. unlike coderre, since the start of the campaign, we have learned a lot about his unscrupulous candidates as well as denis' questionable income.
let that sink in.
it is still to be taken with a grain of salt ...
go vote please! nothing is played, far from it.
lets go val lets go
so balarama holness is not that much of a player in this election according to this poll, since it was done from november 2 to 4 i imagine that it was the tax scandal that penalized coderre
i don't like plante, but among the candidates we have she is the most logical choice.
it will do us the greatest good to keep valérie as mayor!
i hope pm makes inroads in the west as well. 
i'd like to live closer to my family, but i've gotten accustomed to living without my car and it would be great if they could use a little magic around the rem stations (specifically sunnybrooke and p-r) and make cycling easier.
regardless of the final outcome, we can say that plante is extremely combative in the countryside (2x times she comes back a very big delay) and / or that coderre is really a bad politician.
regardless this has been an insanely fought campaign and isn’t over yet
plante is in the lead because we have coderre in the ass.
do not underestimate gilbert thibodeau, his internal polls must be reached at 50% today!
valérie plante in 6
i hope that won't tell people not to go and vote.
maybe well, but it's not yet ganged. if you care about mtl, go vote.
it could be much worse
denis ** does not stop telling lies! ** wake up, the pro-coderre, cibole !!!
how come coderre is so popular among non-french speakers?
the montreal media have accelerated their campaign "re-elect sister sourire" for a week.
i seriously hope both her and coderre lose, but doubtful. god they're both awful.
we should just change the name of this sub to projet montreal. this sub has clearly been high jacked by the pm minions
it's diwali, all indians are doing fireworks, also why they have christmas lights on
it’s diwali. people are celebrating and setting off fireworks
oh thank god. i’m in lasalle about to go to work in the ndg area and i keep hearing popping. so i thought it was either fire works or gun shots.
it's /u/eric_bousquet shooting his guns so he can post guns related articles the next morning
i heard it too, actually.
but there was a shooting on demaisonneuve and walkley last night. someone who lives around there told me she was woken up in the wee hours by cops asking if she'd heard or seen anything.
tuhanu diwali diyan bohat both vadhaiyan!!!!
it’s fireworks. actually some just went off again ffs
yeah fireworks, they've been going off in little italy as well
it's [diwali]( so fireworks are expected. last night around 9, i was taking a walk and i saw a group of people put fireworks in the middle of the street and run. most went up, but a couple fell on their side and shot horizontally, exploding in a gas station. not cnsst approved.
yeah i keep hearing it too. like a bunch of firecrackers or something
the elmhurst block back to business lmao
i hear the same thing in villeray. at least tonight and yesterday.
two shootings in two days
it's run ndg practicing their freestyles.
did you just hear them now? i’m in ndg and i’m pretty sure it’s coming from the train
probably one of them rich hampstead kids with their backfiring burble tunes on their cars
lol omg i just posted something about this just now. i guess we just heard the same noise just 30 minutes ago! there actually was a shooting last night so...
it's both. here in montreal nord, if it's 8pm-11pm, it's probably fireworks. 
althought i did once hear a gunshot and someone screaming in pain, then i saw 15 police cars block the street near my house and a tva news camera crew appear, but that was the only gunshot i really heard in this time period in montreal. (it was an attempted murder, the guy survived).
usually the gunshots happen at 2-3am because some wannabe idiot gangster kid is shooting his gun.
now as for your concerns, if you cannot make out if it's a gunshot sound or not, that most likley means you're hundreds of meters away, you should not have to worry about it, because if it was a gunshot sound, people living close to that sound would have dialed 911 already.
and i have heard real guns like ak-47, pistols and other types of guns in other countries and they are super loud if you are near them.
i saw fireworks in the verdun area around 10:30, could probably be heard in ndg.
oh actually reading now that there was gunfire last night in cdn-ndg.
i’m on the plateau and i often hear the same noises that you described
phew, that's a little bomb. the guy is very present on the rs to push the projects of the party, he really has a lot of visibility.
sup / u / craigsauve
/ u / craigsauve !!!
5$ he was told to leave
hhmmm his reasoning is that he quit so that he wouldn’t become a distraction to projet montreal so close to election night and he still maintains his innocence but do you think that that will have the opposite effect?
i knew mr. sauvé a long time ago and i do not believe this for a minute. if i still lived in sud ouest i'd vote for him anyway!
politics can be disgusting at times. it smacks of sabotage from the coderre team. there is nothing worse than business like this to make people cynical.
the guy posts super biased articles on the sub ... he's a chosen fucking ...
i can't even believe it's tolerated by mods.
but at the same time, seeing the way the sub is managed, i'm not surprised
oooh no good
horrible timing for this news, but it's the right thing to do.
bonnnn awesome esti, don't you tempt to keep your seed box in your pants?
edit: i am aware that this is reactionary on my part but come on ...
it was one of the pillars of projet montréal, indeed.
another nail in the coffin for val! 😍😍😍
we're never getting that ama now
yeah this is weird. i'm thinking that valerie probably asked him to. but in any case this just makes it seems like a bigger deal than it was.
probably so that coderre can not cling to that in the media.
i’m still voting for him. my reasoning is that this current accusation is alleged, and whereas i generally support the #believewomen movement as a survivor myself, i’ve also had at least two close males in my life who were falsely accused, so i know firsthand how it can happen. either way, i am also voting for someone with a proven track record of caring about local politics and community members, and i can’t let alleged accusations impose on that until something has been proven. the timing is also highly sus. i’m not sure what i believe, but with the information i currently have, i still think voting for him is the right decision.
it is not coderre who has these accusations on the back ...
i'm not sure i understand your point? can you elaborate?
what?
yes long wait times have been an issue for decades especially in qc. this isn’t a new discussion.
no it won’t effect you at your most vulnerable.
the triage system assigns codes to determine how urgent it is for a patient to be seen. somebody coming in with a heart attack or a seizure is going to be seen right away.
somebody with a split knee is not going to be a priority if there are more urgent cases ahead of them.
édit: im not saying that this is a good thing and that they should wait that long.  i’m just providing an explanation as to how it works and that somebody in a life or death situation wouldn’t have that experience as op was suggesting.
a split knee is not an emergency as it is not life threatening so that explains why it takes so long. real life threatening cases get treated first and anything else gets to wait.
is nothing new btw, that's why some people drive to an ontario hospital, even with the drive you'll get home sooner.
its triage. the reality is that the kids stitches are simply not a priority of the er. anyone with an actual emergency will be seen before them, as they should be. the fact that you've been there a long time does not change that.
the lesson here is to think about what constitutes an appropriate use of the er. we in canada have a very entitled notion that the er is the appropriate place to go for any scratch, scrape or minor injury, and we get indignant and take to reddit when we are not immediately accommodated. stitches to the knee does not constitute an emergency, sorry. a family doc or walk in clinic could easily have stitched the kid up in the morning. 
if you treat the er like your personal walk in, you are contributing to the problem.
we have serious issues with health  care in this country. we had to have longer lockdowns cause our health care system had shit capacity as well.
however the debate in healthcare in this country is 'we are better then america stfu"
and nothing else. many eu countries have much better systems.
it's definitely a problem. we've had a few 
er visits this past year and in my experience, triage works well in that if you have a true emergency they see you right away. but one thing i think quebec needs to add are "urgent care" clinics. these exist in the us and are designed to address minor emergencies. so things that can't wait till the next business day, but that are not an immediate, needs to be addressed asap emergency. so for example, if you break your arm, or need stitches. or for kids, if your baby has a high fever, youd go to urgent care and if they thought it was a true emergency, they might transfer you to the er but otherwise just see you there. the challenge here is that clinics are closed on the weekends and after hours, or if you can't get an appointment at a clinic, you are default forced to go to the er, which isn't a good option. there needs to be something in between that fills the gap between regular clinic appointment and er.
always take non-emergency stuff to a clinic instead.
triage.
i broke my tibia once at mont-tremblant. they had a clinic down there and they were checking on all the injuries there.
first, they made me wait in the clinic after asking me basic questions such as: level of pain, how do you feel, etc. which i answered honestly: not too much pain, but i cant really walk, and of course, next,  they make me take a walk & on the first step, i hear cracks and the nurse gets scared lol. later, they would finally take an x-ray where they see the extent of the injury (it was bad, spiral fracture) . quickly, they apply a full leg plaster and tell me to call a certain number to "take a appointement for a doctor check - @ a hospital".
i call that number and they tell me that the next appointment is in a month, but that they would call me back if anything opens and there's nothing else that i should do.
distressed because obviously it was a bad injury that could require surgery, two days later, i go to the er on my own. there i wait for about 10 hours for a doctor. they finally take me in and they decide that i would have to go into surgery the next day. the next day, i wait again in er, they take me in the surgery room and i end up with 11 screws in my tibia.
i guess this is how it is here.
we're still in a pandemic. 
of course it's not normal, but healthcare isn't back to normal in any form yet. many of us are moving past what we went through, and it seems like life is very nearly back to normal, but they're still in it. 
not saying it doesn't suck for the kid and their parents, and i'm sure a really unpleasant night, but this was not a life-threatening issue either. 
plenty of people will face grave and significant beyond their time consequences for the fact that healthcare isn't able to be normal yet. surgeries, diagnoses, treatment delayed. they recently didn't have enough donated blood to do relatively routine surgeries.
people here shitting on you for trying to get a child taken care of. ffs this system is slow, badly managed, and, as opposed to what people seem to imply, not free; we're all paying high taxes for it. the "oh you're the idiot since you didn't go to a clinic" sounds a lot like pushing the blame on to the individual. i think we should have higher standards than "at least i won't go broke." and that will only happen through acknowledgment of public discontent.
i went to the er for the first time in my life about 6 months ago (no worse, at 32). obviously i expected it to be long like everyone says. but naively, i told myself that "long" it was maybe 4-5 hours ... i had brought nothing with me, no water, food or entertainment, just a phone with 50% battery . finally, i was there 26 hours and it was really not pleasant. but hey ... i could see that all the employees were doing their best and there was absolutely nothing more they could have done to make it happen faster, so i made up for it!
yes it’s always been this way. my friend recently waited 16 hours for his very painful broken arm. 
15 years ago i had to wait 9 hours even though they knew i had been instructed to not eat or drink before my scan.
if you go to the er without an emergency, you're not going to be a priority.
[deleted]
not a new issue. 
people defending the system needs to wake up. you spend so much so much again so much on taxes to have a proper system. regardless if you are aa top priority or not.  a 7 yo that requires stitches should not be in pain for 12 hours until someone sees him. when people are spending this much in taxes at least a proper healthcare and proper roads...
for people saying this is normal, the average waiting time for non urgent cases in melbourne is under 1 hour. they have triage as well. they have public healthcare as well.
i spent over 8 hours in the er with a pinched nerve. my leg felt like cement. to make matters even worse, there was a crazy lady harassing everyone in the waiting room all night. she didn't get to see the doctor either. in fact, the only person that night that did make it into er was some guy that arrived drunk and bloody on a stretcher. i eventually just went home, tried to sleep, went to a different er. they saw me within an hour.
another time i waited with a dislocated shoulder for 3 hours. when i did eventually see the doctor, he fixed my shoulder in a couple minutes and said he didn't understand why i had been made to wait so long. was a quick, easy fix to a painful problem.
however, i've also had a couple times (i've dislocated my shoulder a bunch) when i pretty much went straight from triage to the doctor.
most ers don't have extra people on standby all night. during the day, things move fast. at night, most non-urgent care waits until morning. 
the real problem is the lack of communication about this. if when this person walked in, they were told "we won't stitch it up until the morning, just put a bandage and get the kid to bed. here's an appointment for 8am", then it wouldn't be such a horrible experience. but somehow healthcare systems aren't designed to handle that.
priorities. this is not a serious injury.
of course, the waiting time is challenging and stressful for a young kid and their parents, but it remains a non medical priority.
i experienced the most amazing display of cognitive skill last weekend.
upon entering a restaurant downtown, we were asked for our vaccination proofs. we happily displayed them on our phones, and the host verified them and seated us. this part is normal.
the absolutely amazing part is that the host was able to verify our qr codes with nothing more than his own eyes and mind! no verification app, not even a digital scan of any sort! i mean, i know how qr codes work and all, but these ones are big—they contain lots of data—and they're signed with a verifiable public/private key. i was so impressed by this restaurant worker's *raw* skill! amazing!

shoutout to / u / aestyx for recommending me 5/3/1 for beginners two weeks ago, my bench and deadlift exploded. i now understand that stronglifts is a super pocket program. i spend less time hanging out at the gym, i really lift more total weight, and my sessions are shorter. win win win in esti. the next thing here is to tackle my fat accumulated in my forties. i've managed to keep the exact same weight for the 2 months that i've been going to the gym, so i actually lost fat to make room for muscle, except it's looooong at this rate. it's time to show off those muscles i'm building instead of keeping them coated!
column from a secondary school teacher: i gave a job to my secondary 5 to hand in this week. i realize that in terms of methodology and presentation of work, they are quite limited and that worries me for those who go to cegep. i don't see them very often so i don't have much time to give them a method lesson. in my opinion, this is something that should be done from secondary 1 or 2 and we add more over time. something as simple as the presentation of text: font, justified, etc. is not even acquired ...
on a positive note, i really have fun with my instagram teacher account, it's a wonderful communication tool!
big moment: finally at the age of 30, i try a joyeux festin! my boyfriend was so shocked when i told him i had never had any, we went to the drive-through the next day xd and my toy was ... a book. boooouuhh .. but then i got caught up in the monopoly madness, it's so satisfying to tear up the ti-papers ..

my sister and my niece (from paris) were visiting montreal this week.
she found that everything costs more here than in paris (food, clothing, accommodation, ...)
strange.
i had a dental implant installed this week. i thought it would be as worse as a bone graft, but so far it's significantly less painful and swollen.
must say that i did not skimp on codeine this time: p.
i have at least a week to have these kidding sutures.
it sucks having bad teeth.
i am thinking of retiring soon. i wonder if i stay or if i sell and consecrate my camp outside of montreal. i love the city and i love the countryside ... dilemma ...
super big week on the work side.
i just can't get back to the beat of my big weeks.
do you have any tips?
this weekend it's swiss fondue with fast 9 on the tv because we're * classy * here 👌
podcast du moment: [the happiness lab with dr. laurie santos]( [en]
the months of september and october were difficult and stressful especially for me. the structural reorganization, the drama between colleagues, the depressing personal life ... this podcast has helped me to get out of my bubble at times. maybe it can help you too or at least show you another way of looking at happiness. topics are presented simply with not only scientific research, but sociological and historical links. often, guests on the podcast arrive with original experiences to share.
i discovered a "new" podcast recently, "behind the bastards". i * just * finished the double episode on alfred hitchcock, and wow. i'm a huge fan of hitch, and i knew he was crooked, but not that bad. poor tippi hedren!
very very interesting on the other hand, i highly recommend (the double episode on josh duggar of 19 and counting "was not stung with verses either.
i also started (and soon finished) the last senécal, "flots". ayoye tabarnak, she is something, flo. i thought i would finish it last night but i really needed a break. excellent, but also extremely twisted. bye. (as flo would say).
people near downtown / plateau, where do you go to the gym and how much do you pay per month? what i'm looking for is a not-too-crowded gym with machines and free weights and the least additional cost (not a fan of group yoga, dance, aerobics etc.)
i'll top you. 
a couple of weeks ago i asked a server if we needed to show our passports after we sat down.
she said she'd go ask the owner in the kitchen.
from the kitchen, no less, he was able to see that we were all good with our vaccine passports!
people are amazing!
you're joking but this might be possible in a decade or so with some special contact lenses
yeah!! 💪🏼
i have noticed this for several years as well. as software becomes more and more user-friendly, users become less and less skilled. students do not understand how to save a document, save it to a usb drive, or send it by email. they experience technology through their phones and apps that automatically save to the cloud. so, in front of a computer, they are caught off guard. it's funny, because when we were in high school, we were better at computer science than our teachers, and now it's the other way around!
are there no more sec 5 metho lessons?
my kids had one. it was indeed not too much.
when i was young we had a method class in secondary 1. it covered a lot of stuff, eg. layout, using a diary, etc.
cegep teacher here. indeed, even before the pandemic, we see that students know less and less how to use a computer.
like not knowing how to turn it on, not understanding folder navigation, using duplicate caplock instead of shift.
i teach natural science students, so let's say it's like a mini “culture” shock to see people go to science but keep stubbornly handing in handwritten assignments because “kid in word it's long"
we love them the same

i guess its a step into the right direction .packaging will be another thing to work on
with the plastic baggies and containers they have the ingredients in, i agree but those boxes containing everything that are lined to keep it cool are pretty good. if you get them regularly, they take the empty boxes out when they deliver their new stuff.
why not just go to the emergency? at most you'll have a 18-24 hour wait but once they do testing and confirm you have a gastro problem they will have one come in to see you.
looks like you're getting downvoted for questioning the superiority of the shit healthcare system we have.
ask again to be referred to a specific (different) gastroenterologist and skip the crds thing.
so i had gi issues after moving to quebec from ontario and for a while i didn’t have a ramq card but i also no longer had an ohip. i know you can technically pay up front and then claim it later but for fucks sake when you’re sick how do you even start looking into that?
anyway eventually after being misdiagnosed and poorly served by the clinic at the queen elizabeth (let’s check for parasites even though you haven’t travelled pay for them privately!) i eventually went and parked my butt in the er at the vic (glen) and didn’t move until i got to see a gastroenterologist. 
they sent an intern the intern and eventually the attending and then the next day he did an endoscopy at both ends and determined i had a severe case of crohns. from everything i have googled since presentation was preeeetty classic and the clinic should have caught it. i saw a specialist who got me a prescription for prednisone not long after that. 
so when in doubt the er isn’t just for head wounds. they have a lot of good doctors there.
i'm a little unsure of what happened when you said you were "paired with a local clinic who sent in a consultation".
did you physically (or virtually) see a gp who did an initial assessment and wrote a referral ? or did they send your request straight to crds without even an initial assessment?
emergency is an option, but don't be in any kind of hurry, especially these days. other than that, yeah, i guess is go to private or try to ask again for a consult on public sector... maybe they'll let it go through this time
pharmacist are easily accessible and fairly knowledgeable… maybe they could help?
as someone with stomach issues in the meantime go to a pharmacy and ask for nexium. you can get 30 days without a prescription. if it helps (as in fixes all your problems as it did mine) you can go to a walk on clinic for a script. if it doesn't help, go to emergency they next time you have the pain becasue if nexium doesn't help you've got a serious issue.
and to add, the emergency is how to see a doctor within 24 hours when you're in pain. it's a shitty workaround that eats your time but it is foolproof if needed.
the crds is how you ask for a referral if you don't have a family doctor.
thanks for sharing your experience.
i am a little uncomfortable going to er because i already had an endoscopy in alberta and they found nothing. so i essentially have a fully psychosomatic illness. the doctor on the help line said that i should get checked a second time just in case, but as far as i know there are no tests that can eeval what is going on with me.
that's why i was really excited to see a specialist, because maybe they will know why i have this pain.
hey -- i'm going to pm you
hi, 
i only spoke to the physician over the phone. this was after i called a health line but i don't remember which one. i'm pretty sure i spoke to a nurse, explained what was going on, then i was transferred to the doctor, i explained everything, and they then sent in the referral. 
i got an email from their clinic confirming that i was referred to a gastroenterologist.
the pharmacist can’t “help”. they could only suggest something over the counter to op. if op’s clinic said they needed to see a gastroenterologist, there is no way a pharmacist is going to be able to do shit.
nexium doesn't work for me but ranitidine does. unfortunately i'm at the maximum dose so if it gets worse i can't increase the dose.
you don't need a family doctor to get a referral. simply go to a walk-in  clinic and ask the doctor you see to get one.
what about famotidine (pepcid ac)? my doctor said i could mix it with ranitidine. i have the chewable pepcid ac which is like a rolaids famotidine and i take them as an extra.
im sorry if this is all redundant, i hope something gets better for you.
ok thanks for the information. i always just assumed walk in clinics were unreliable.
you are right i can mix for example dexillant or any ppi with ranitidine. 
i'm just not sure if it will do anything because the ranitidine is much much more effective than the ppi.
no worries! i appreciate anyone who is nice enough to try to help :)
that's where most family doctors work, so....
where i'm from most people have their own family doctor. i've never been to a walk in but when i researched it many people said that walk in clinics often don't even have anyone in staff with any medical licence at all and they will just lie to you toget your money.
it's cute to worry about racial profiling when you interpret stats from your luxury condo in a gentrified white neighborhood, but it's pretty much fun for those who live in red light districts and hear too much. often gunfire, worrying about their children and having little choice of places to move. the citizens of the neighborhoods concerned are often minorities. can we think of them a little?
it is really anything as an article. they themselves contradict their statistics.
> with regard to crimes against the person in which a firearm was present (used or not), the picture remains ambivalent. from 2019 to 2020, there is certainly an increase in attempted murder (from 33 to 57) and assault (from 144 to 197) in the presence of a firearm. but, for the same years, we note a decrease in homicides (from 10 to 5) and robberies (from 157 to 139) in the presence of a weapon.
all this to lead to the following conclusion:
> according to professor rutland, the police are seeking to regain the legitimacy they lost with the black lives matter movement and the revelations about the seriousness of racial profiling in montreal.
>  
> for ted rutland, “the police simply cannot prevent gun violence. it can only intervene after the fact ”by arresting people or confiscating weapons already in circulation. "what the police can do is monitor, harass and arrest people they see as criminals", that is to say especially young people of color, exposes the professor.
so according to sui, the police must not investigate gun violence because it will mostly involve people of color. wow.
added: ted rutland is the same person behind this 2020 post.
[
> last february, worried about the creation of this new squad which includes around twenty investigators, ted rutland asked the public security commission to demand a report from the spvm, which would have shown the racial origin of those arrested by the new squad. his request was refused.
> he then asked, through the access to information act, to obtain the file numbers of the 31 people arrested by the squad between december 2019 and april 2020. by various means, he then determined the racial origin of all of these defendants. result: 74% of them are black, 19.4% are white and 6.5% are racialized people, but not black.
> "blacks are 42 times more likely to be arrested and charged by the anti-gun squad than whites," concludes mr. rutland. the majority of the anti-firearms squad's targets are located in the northeast of the city, particularly in montreal-north.
i'm having a hard time figuring out exactly where the problem is. too many black people are arrested for gun-related offenses so isn't that fair?
> the number of offenses involving a firearm (excluding crimes against the person)
lol wut? gun crime against buildings is on the decline, so are we safe? (i'm kidding, of course. in fact this statistic probably shows that despite the rise in crimes against persons with firearms, fewer criminals are being caught transporting one illegally. nothing to celebrate).
> an increase in attempted murder (from 33 to 57) and assault (from 144 to 197) in the presence of a firearm. but, for the same years, we note a decrease in homicides (from 10 to 5) and robberies (from 157 to 139) in the presence of a weapon.
so there have been a lot ** more ** violent gun crimes but don't worry because they have been ** less ** successful? is it good news that more criminals shoot less well?
the author is a student in literary studies at uqam. i think he should leave criminology to others ...
> the one who looked at the spvm data points out that the police department ** has never counted the shots before this year. ** "you have to be wary when the police invent new categories [of events] to show us that we are not safe. "
i find the rest of the stats a bit iffy, but that's probably the best point. it tells me that we don't have much * solid * to justify the increase in the police presence. we just trust the general judgment of the police force and public opinion, and it is what it is.
paging / u / eric_bousquet
that does not surprise me.
rather, it is the type of violence generated that changes (because reality changes, you mean ...)
the overall trend is very good, it is true. but, in the short term, we have a street gang war. the last time we had this kind of problem was [20 years ago with the biker war] ( we must not wait after a second [daniel desrochers] ( to react. we absolutely have to crush the criminal groups that are causing problems.
i can't wait for monday ...
the politibots can't even hide. it's really heavy.

another proof that the facts are useless in the human sciences.
> so there were a lot more violent firearms crimes, but don't worry because they were less successful?
in addition, the success of an attempted murder is strongly influenced by the quality of the medicine.

i just saw that one of the most active anonymous twitter accounts created in the wake of the arrival of coderre who was promoting ensemble montreal (and especially the dirtying of projet montreal in fact) has just been deleted. like right there, friday at 5 a.m. before the election.
when you try to talk about epistemology but you don't even understand the meaning of the word proof in this context.
we compare 2019 to 2020, i don't think our surgeons have become 2x better in 1 year.

i understand that this is a more direct way of speaking but it is made a little ridiculous.
but it often compares with the 70s for example.

miss villeray, famous montreal landmark of the far right / s
it would surprise me that the miss had recourse against the creators of the film who used her famous image.
however, the person who owns the copyright in the sign might be able to sue. it would be fun.
probably animators from montreal based studio that did the art work thought it would be funny to put it in.
can i buy a print
what is miss villeray?
very likely that it is the miss who holds the rights in fact. you kind of buy them when you have such a work done for your purposes and pay for it. but hey, not as if there was a big recourse to be done with it, because little damage or enrichment if there is any.
yes, give me $300 and print it yourself

> in reality, the profit margins in gastronomy are about 2% - and this small profit is eaten up in advance by the expenses to repair the ovens, replace the furniture, renew the decoration, etc.
to a restaurant owner, he doesn't seem to understand the concept of "profit margin"
i grew up with my parents running a restaurant and while i loved restaurant culture, i didn't want anything to do with owning one. it's a hard life and even more difficult when you try to make it at the level of mousso. for anyone criticizing it for its prices, the amount of training and labor plus the cost of its ingredients is actually still probably worth over $ 400 per person. there is a reason there is a limited number of seats, it is not baton rouge or mikes. he is one of the best chefs in canada and there are a lot of people who are able and willing to pay that to experience eating at his restaurant although most people (myself included) who cannot afford it or who can perhaps afford it but are not interested enough to justify the cost. some people like luxury cars or motorcycles, some people like designer clothes or want a cabin by a lake, some people want to travel, and some people like fancy restaurants. good luck to him because even if i don't eat there, his restaurant contributes to making a name for the culture of montreal beyond our island.
to say that her supper is worth as much as going to see madonna lipsyncer at the bell center is really absurd as a comparison and is almost a fallacy in my opinion.
he brings a lot of good points, but his pen makes it sound like whining.
even after reading all of this, i don't understand why it is broken. it is popular, it charges more than low-end restaurants, but it pays its employees as badly as they do.
explain to me the bottle that i don't get.
i do not understand. he seems to be claiming subsidies? !! for a restaurant? lol it's a joke his business.
close your restaurant and move on. you're not doing anyone a favor. the taxpayers owe you nothing. anyway, you don't even want anyone to spend money in your restaurant.
i am ambivalent ... at the same time i understand that managing a restaurant is a crazy job, with long hours and difficult living conditions. at the same time, i find the decision to be extreme.
it could now cost $ 400 / person to go to his restaurant, so close to $ 1000 for two people. seriously ... other than those for whom the cash is falling from the sky on their knees, who is going to go there?
if 35% of your customers come from abroad, the remaining 65% do you really think they will not consider going elsewhere? even in the same kind of table (top gastronomy) there are going to be a bunch of cheaper options. like $ 250 per person.
increase the prices a little, reduce the opening hours ... ok. but from there to doing one service per evening and increasing the costs as much ... it's really a bold move.
a few things are conflated. 
he's not wrong in that 2-5% is a restaurant that's doing very well... and isn't the majority, and requires the majority to drastically underpay their staff while providing very few benefits or salary protections. all this compounded by availability of good staff bc so many left the industry during the pandemic. 
where it's slightly askew is that he's one of very, very few fine dining establishments in montreal. the peers he compares himself to are great but they aren't prix fixe and even though average bills maybe be similar, they are a lot more accessible. they also likely require less expensive ingredients, less labor costs, and so on. fine dining takes more work bc the food is more elaborate, technical and so on. that's not a value judgment it's just a fact. that's a lot of why it is more expensive. 
and he's not wrong that people all over the world pay and travel for fine dining experiences and build a trip around food first. montreal is absolutely a foodie destination. if we didn't have the better restaurants, few are coming just for bagels, smoked meat and poutine. 
but i do wonder what the right solution is. i mean, i don't think my neighborhood pub which has great food needs a grant related to touristic contribution. or a poutine place that's always busy. so which restaurants would get it? 
maybe it's more like a grant on any food products purchased for the restaurant that are 100% local producers of quebec and a lesser one for canada, and 0 for imported. 
honestly i feel bad for him bc he is incredibly talented if you've had his food, it really is something special. and i do think independent restaurants should have a way forward. 
the older ones that are still around have come at a price. so many great chefs of mtl restaurants we know and love paid a pretty steep price, personally. and many now are likely as profitable as they are bc they're selling branded food products and merchandise. i mean, that's fantastic for them but should every restaurant need to do that to survive?
so, if catering is so bad (worse real estate according to many owners) and no one makes a penny with that, why are so many people doing it? it cries, it cries ....
he uses the rest of his margin to pay his employees.
it is his arrogance that cuts my appetite. as if a restaurant should be subsidized. and if he could really charge $ 400 / service and make a profit from it he shouldn't be writing a 3 page article about how hard everything is. all he does is whine and take the victim's position. honestly get over it. just the fact that he thinks his little restaurant makes lntreal a tourist destination shows how arrogant he is. yes 35% of this clientele are foreigners, how many of them have decided to come to montreal to pay for the hotel room, go see the whales because of their restaurant? i don't assume much.
so don't be naive, his dinner is worth what people are willing to pay for. there is no great arbiter of objective value.
if people want bbq chicken and pizz 'take out, that's a lot of value but ...
parcqu'à montreal, operating a single restaurant and making a sustained profit is a feat.
add covid and the general rise in the prices of food and the rest and you have your explanation.
the icing on the cake: most chefs who leave restaurants are not good managers.
if it's as much (or more profitable) by charging $ 250 instead of $ 150, why not? it is quite simply the notion of supply and demand that applies here.
on the other hand, i find that the article is a lot of whining, about everything that moves (governments, the industry itself, consumers, everyone is there!) without really identifying a specific problem - i not sure what to think after that, except that this guy makes me think a lot of everyone i know who's been burned out.
it's his restaurant, he has the right to take the risks he wants. the ultra-ultra haute-gastronomy / 3 michelin stars of this world, the french laundry / osteria francescana, they don't have to fill their room. it remains to be seen if he is at this level.
i agree on all your points. 
ferrer gambled on that and put too much energy in branching out. juste pour rire fiasco happened and then the pandemic. since he was too invested outside of europea, the menu stalled and the restaurant lost its momentum.
as for mousso, i agree with his point of view. i mean everyone deserves a decent salary and quality of life. that being said i think mousso made the jump too quickly by cutting one service and upping its price. surely there would have been an inbetween where it would have been possible to up the price by 40-50$, offering 9 plates instead of 12, moving the first service 30 min or one hour early, etc. 
anyway, i can afford mousso, i had planned to go there first thing when it would reopen, but with the new pricing, i prefer trying out 2-3 new high quality restaurants for the same final price.
no. if the staff is as badly paid as a restaurant that charges 10% and the portions are tiny if the explanation is not a powder budget, i don't know what it is.
it charges 400 instead of 200. adds the tip and the tax. yikes.
i was waiting for its reopening to reserve to celebrate an important event, but there ... i chose another restaurant because i don't have $ 1000 to put on a meal for two. no matter how good it is, it costs less than half that at toqué ...
you should go and visit the kitchen of rousso (or any other large restaurant) vs that of a canteen.
you would then understand the amount of labor it takes to bring out these types of dishes.
i'm not saying it's affordable, i'm just saying that if it can get away with that price, why would it charge less?
clearly, there are people who will not follow. but there are a lot more people than you might think, who, in montreal, can afford to put that much money on a meal on a regular basis.
with wine, it can go up to, you don't have to slam that much.
lmao, as someone who works in the federal government i can assure you that francophones are not second class citizens. all of my directors have been francophone and most of their subordinates aren't...
thank god. the article says 80% of their calls are in english, so it makes sense. as someone trying to legally immigrate to canada, it seems like quebec is intentionally making things difficult for the majority of its immigrants. (i am trying to learn french, and i have no problem with doing that, but this is big legal stuff, it would be great if i could understand what was going on.)
i've worked at the ircc call center.
i can say about 1-2 calls on 10 were from francophones.
there are some days i did not even receive one. although, that was not very common.
the ircc call center has a lot of issues. the fact that we are the only one in canada is ridiculous as well.
there used to be two or three, but harper closed those and kept the one in montrea.
ideally, there should be a call center out west and the one here.
personally, when i call a technical support line, i choose english because the waiting time is shorter.
why do they get so many calls in english, though?
"* considering that over 80% of calls received at the \ [customer support center \] are in english, the csc is moving forward with the creation of unilingual english agent positions. *"
this same article is being bashed on r/quebec.
every chance they get....
given that it’s a call centre, why not just hire more for centres outside of quebec? reduce the number of staff or just a hiring freeze for the centre in quebec and increase the number of positions in the centres outside of quebec? assuming that immigration canada has a call centre outside of quebec. then there would be nothing to complain about? if 80% of the calls are in english and quebec doesn’t want english only positions then 80% of call centre agents should be located outside of quebec. why should taxpayers pay a bilingual salary premium to so many agents when it isn’t necessary? i know the premium isn’t much for each individual employee but combined that premium is a lot of money.
how do i apply?
extremely funny. given that you have to prove that you speak french to immigrate in quebec (quebec is the most complicated region in canada to
immigrate for qualified educated immigrants). i am myself a french citizen who grew up
in france and with master degree in engineering and 3 yoe in montréal and i had to prove that i speak french by giving all my original certified school results from 11 years old until 18 years old). also i have to wait for 3 years to obtain my permanent residency. same process for the same profile in ontario? 6 months.
good to know the head of air canada will have a fall-back job if he’s let go.
the real question is how many unilingual positions, knowing that there were already unilingual anglophone exceptions accepted (but not the case for french)?
and what is the target unilingual / bilingual ratio?
that said, if it can facilitate the process for the french to access immigration, i can understand the idea, nevertheless depending on the political will of the moment, it can also have the opposite effect.
i hope psac fights this tooth and nail. there are very few positions designated french unilingual in qc as most require minimum bbb on the sle, so creating english essential positions is a slap in the face to québec.
my friend at the federal level says that there are two official languages in the government of canada: english and its translations.
many immigrants to quebec already speak french. the french (duh!), haitians, mahgrébins, west and central africans… in fact, i wouldn't be surprised if it was a majority.
its funny to think that a french speaker has to be bilingual to work there, but not anglos. its also funny that that would make francophones more qualified for the job, but will receive the same salary at their monolingual anglos counterpart ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
it's funny, the anglos on / r / canada say they choose french. so they come across a bilingual from montreal instead of a guy in india with an incomprehensible accent.
if there were more french-speaking employees, it might not take that long ...
it's a vicious circle.
well no it's the other way around, anglos speak french to avoid talking to an employee of the call center in india.
because immigrants come from everywhere, and english is the world's most common second language.
english is ironically the *lingua franca* of the world so its common amongst people looking to immigrate to a new place.
the choice of montrealers is between plante, coderre and holness.
lol you are lucky.
they spoke of a security issue in the village discussed this morning, does anyone have a connection? i find nothing on the subject ...
perhaps, over time, he could reach a level of french equal to that of ceos of large french groups like [ben smith at air france] ( du-ciel / chroniques-du-ciel-ben-smith-general-director-of-air-france-klm-our-main-asset-to-get-out-of-the-crisis-is-our-network- mondial_4031405.html) or [tom enders formerly at airbus] (
before improving it, he would have to learn it!
just after despising french
oh brother, the french-speaking media love playing the victim. poor babies
not sincere excuse because in an interview afterwards he says that french has never been an issue.
all this crying about what language i decide to speak makes me not care about french.
to mods. this is not a post on the fact that the ceo of air canada is a big racist who does not want to speak french and needs francophones, but on the fact that he apologizes for his racist remarks and that he will learn french.
the height? ben smith was # 2 at air canada before (behind calin rovinescu) and was already leading presentations in french at the time ...
michael rousseau could have saved himself a lot of trouble with a simple "i want to learn french in my new role" or something like that.
eh bin 🤦
sooo true 🤣🤣🤣
you need to call everyday, also call your arrondissement.
once they redid the asphalt on the street in front of my building in the middle of the night. the whole building was shaking, not sure exactly what they were doing...
called non emergency and 311, the answer was "well we have to do the work some times."...
nevermind that it was in the middle of the night, in the middle of the week...
ugh that's horrible. which part of town?
they were ripping up the streets in ndg for fuck knows how long...the next street was torn apart and i felt so fucking bad for the residents. they replaced the water mains and had to dig into their driveways. we had the same done on my street but it wasn't quite as extensive but it took the better part of a month. i think i was lucky because my bedroom is at the rear of the house, but i felt the vibrations.
i lived on st denis a few years back while they were building the french hospital... non stop 24h construction. it was considered essential so they were aloud. it was to the point we went to the regis to ask to break our lease and it was denied. we couldn't sleep, we couldn't study during the day. it was terrible.
if anything i would call 311 but i don't think it will really resolve anything. i certainly don't see it as a police issue.
ultimately the short term inconvenience for a few will dramatically expediate the resolution of the long term inconvenience to the many dealing with the closed streets.
go listen to the latest episode of la facture on tou.tv they cover a case of smell caused by the city contractor underground work, similar to your current problem as it is a constant nuisance.
if you have public security in your area, call them.
are they actively doing construction in the middle of the night? regardless a bit of white noise should actually be helpful to sleep.
there's ongoing roadwork right in front of my building and a generator running day and night nevertheless i don't hear a thing inside my apartment. outside is quite loud though.
i would recommend you to move somewhere else.
i remember that. trying to sleep with that noise was frustrating. i remember calling 311 and they told me they can't do much since it was part of the city's work
well yeah, they really can't do anything. it has to be done...
the quéebc overtaxed? since when?
too bad we can't provide list answers or ranges like the candidates could, to actually compare properly.

i would like a journalist to ask coderre how many afternoons he has been * chilling * on space 67 since his last term.
i can imagine him pulling a little blanket and sitting down under the blazing sun to look at his beautiful cement as far as the eye can see, saying to himself:
> wow, in another promising project that, denis! criss that we're good.
this morning i persisted with one of my boyfriends after sending him the press link that talks about coderre and the construction contractor. i remembered this post on reddit which showed the destruction of the jean-drapeau park and i managed to find it with the reddit search (a miracle!) so i was thinking that it was a good time to bring this image out again on the sub :) the original post was courtesy of our / u / matt_mg here: 
they paved the creek ?!
tabarnak…. what a shame.
i took a pic of this monstrosity on the ground a while ago. in hindsight, i remember hearing vague rumblings about this but i didn't realize how bad it was.  
large concrete spaces with no shade are notoriously good for heat buildup. good stuff.
yea and because of it they moved all events to the racetrack which meant you couldn’t cycle on it and most of the time couldn’t even cut through. that summer or two was was annoying
i'm not a huge fan of what they did, but it also seems as if most people who complain about this had never been to jean drapeau prior to the changes. 
it wasn't as if they removed lush and dense old growth forests to make this concert venue.... they mostly just paved over what was for 6/12 months of the year a giant mud pit because of the events that were already there annually. 
could it have been done better... yes. did they massacre a huge beautiful forest to make a flat amptheatre no. 
iirc it was about 1000 trees they removed for the whole project. out of just under 20,000 trees on the island. so somewhere around 5% of the total population not including ile notre dame.
i wondered what the island looked like before expo 67. here is: [ //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/ile \ _sainte-helene \ _montreal \ _1947 \ _- \ _a.jpg] (
we notice that the island stopped approximately at the swimming pool (the building was already there). the whole of avenko square was in the water.
i'm not trying to demonstrate anything with this, i just thought you would find it interesting.
1) ruin parc jean-drapeau
2) blame your successors
3) get re-elected
4) ???? (probably shady backroom deals)
5) profit!
for people that regularly attend festivals on the island, the change was needed.  prior to this you would come home and essentially have dust buggers for days.  for the people complaining, do you even visit this space?  probably not.  the open space can be used for biking/rollerblading and any other activity on wheels away from traffic.  as a regular runner, i've seen parents teaching their small children to bike on this space during the summer.  a few years back they setup a japanese light show a la botanical gardens.  if they are smart, they can even setup some rinks for the winter.  yes some trees were taken down but there are still plenty of sections with greenery to hang out in.
fuck you coderre.
plante also sells wet soil in the techno park
just to clarify, the wetlands we are talking about are mud after osheaga? 🙄
"to put montreal on a map!"
maybe, but he also had part of highway 720 closed in the city center to make it the park of montrealers that did not exist before.
shit. it's been a while since i've been to see a show there. sad that it's made concrete ....
fuck coderre and his promoters ... tired of politicians who scrape everything to secure favors and good jobs afterwards. it should be automatically eliminated from the political scene. personally, i will not go back to see a festival there, it will have lost all its charm and will be much too hot.
so did they just keep those who checked "yes" to "legal background"? positive discrimination, coderre version.
i can’t believe this has been a couple of weeks only and we already have a laundry list of controversies with coderre. imagine 4 years. 
the funniest thing is its supporters who think project montreal is behind that. you really think that an environmentalist political party has as much power as that. no no, it's coderre himself who is his enemy and this time it's his non-existent filter
conquests ?! are we really saying that again in 2021?

😅😅
i only realized he was running a few days ago and he's already fucked up so much harder than i expected. 
he had an ironic cult following amongst the dozen montréal jazz fans, hilarious to see what he's been doing since to the point that playing for a team that won 2 games in a season is actually a massive step down for him...
i wanna say tough break but it really isn't. that's a dumb story in general, let alone for someone thinking he should put public spotlight on himself via an election.

i don't mean to say it's not true ... but the vast majority of the time it's the parents who want the attention.
i, who had barely got used to the idea that they were only urban legends!
how awful!
expos? nobody was going to see the games. why the hell would you bring them back?
oh and by the way, remember that fiasco in quebec city with the nordiques. they built the arena. but, where's the nordiques?
charlatans ...
saying literally what everyone else is saying and passing it off as his own, original thoughts. holness is a scam.
fuck le baseball.
i'm an expos fan and this city is filled with us, dans les deux langues. i also agree that public money should not go to the rotten corrupt scumbags who run mlb.  
that said, i couldn't care less what holness thinks, and i voted last weekend.
montreal had great attendance when they were competitive, i remember in the mid to late 70’s they set the attendance record for a three game series.
you put a stadium downtown near restaurants and night life they’ll draw good crowds with a decent product on the field. 
denver / san diego/ san francisco are prime examples
honestly, an nba team would probably do better and if the habs and a prospective nba team could figure out scheduling, using the bell centre would cost a hell of a lot less.
blue jays has one good season, and every wanna be influencer wants to have a baseball team so they can take selfies with a montreal based team /s
could not agree more.   
i was voting for him because of his montreal should be bilingual position (and the fact that coderre was incompetent during his term)  but this is good as well.
i dont think this guy will win, not because of his policies, but because he looks like a bond villain. all he needs is an eyepatch
only candidate actually speaking sensibly.
i want all my tax money to go the expos. fuck anyone that doesn’t want to spend tax money to bring a major league team back to the city. closed-minded morons
pkp and his secret dealings with the pq. they even have a secret agreement that bans the public from seeing the full extent of the deal and the tax payers paid 200+ million for his vanity project that now sits empty most of the time.
without wanting public investment in the stadium, having a real baseball stadium, which we did not have and in a better location, would change the game significantly.
example: people don't go to see the tampa bay rays because the stadium is horrible and located across the bridge. during this time people go to see the lightning because the arena is in a good location. both clubs are performing very well just to say.
sounds more like an opinion than a fact to me buddy
it's almost as if electoral campaigns are a popularity contest
he's definitely a scammer, but i agree with him on this one.
if he agrees with everyone else on this point, does that make it bad for him to say so? the detail where he's claiming his party is different is wanting the peel basin reserved to social, affordable, and family housing, not anything else about the expos question.
valérie and denis are all for bringing the expos back. it’s original if you ask me.
the city is definitely not filled with us, there's still the same low amount of people who actually regularly attended games, there's just more nostalgists of late. 
people still don't really know anything about the team or its history, in my experience. 
loved the expos, never want a mlb team again. especially with any funding, and especially for some al team...
baseball will be dead within 4-5 seasons here maybe sooner once the novelty wears off. who has 4 hours to spend watching paint dry? i’m not a huge hockey fan but at least the show is great
this is why i plan to vote for holness. montreal must be made a city-state. it is clear that the govt. quebec doesn't give a damn about montreal.
🌈🌈🌈🦄🦄🦄
i support the vote for holness, it takes votes away from coderre and the last thing we need right now is coderre.
bet you most of them would just become traffic cops anyways lol
in 2019, montreal had the second most police officers per 100,000 citizens among cities in canada. [[source](
police presence is not necessarily a bad thing.  it’s the type of police presence that’s the problem.  once serious reforms are made in re: training and culture, it would be important to have as many new officers out there as possible in order to mend relations.  but if we’re talking about the same kind of assholes forget it
good, we need more of those with all the horrible drivers in montreal.
and i cant be the only that feels police presence has increased since covid. by a lot.
once i was at jeanne mance at 10 pm, and there was 2 police trucks (armored trucks) and a dozens of cars just waiting there, with lights on, waiting for the park to close to kick out people from the park.
once i talked to a policeman that was there to shutdown an event an he told me
"well we're just gonna wait here for the djs to get their stuff out and people to disperse. you cant have a stereo here, no stereo. technically you cant use a bluetooth soeaker in public, just your phone. 
but thats some big stereo speakers, you can hear it almost through all the park. no stereo. and thats like 100 people. you can't be more than 5 really. anyway. covid. we re just gonna wait here. we re not gonna get out the car, we re just gonna wait for people to disperse. just waiting. anyways"
he also admitted to me he was fucking tired of dealing with shit bcz of covid rules.
montreal is also the second most populated city in canada, it should be compared with similar city. \[[source](  
montreal has 212 police officers/100 000 citizens, vancouver 196 and toronto 162.
montreal and vancouver should be safer than toronto, with that much more police.
the homicide rate in toronto is 2.03/100 000 citizens, 1.05 in montreal and 1.52 in vancouver.  \[[source](  
so, toronto has less police officers, but more homicide. hiring more could help? i don't know.
are you talking about hypothetical changes in training and culture or are there actually changes currently taking place on that front?
it's needed for sure
sure, i agree 100%, but my main point was that it wouldn't curb violence in the city.
i don't really get the downvotes to your comment. the drivers here are horrendous.
>so, toronto has less police officers, but more homicide. hiring more could help? i don't know.
vancouver has almost 50% more murders per 100,000 compared to montreal (1.52 vs 1.05), in spite of the fact that they hire only 16 cops less per 100,000 citizens (196 vs 212), 8% less than montreal.
police might solve murders, however, they clearly don't prevent them.
so does it work?
yea.  you can say that.  i’m sure there are some efforts being made but i’m not aware of anything concrete/specific.  i also wouldn’t hold my breath.  i guess my point was that less police is not really a solution. just like more police isn’t either.  it’s about better police.  i’m about 40.  when i was young they had flimsy ass linen and the amount of confrontation matched that.  suddenly we decided to deck them out like gijoe and they turned mean.  why bother learning how to talk to me if you can just scare the fuck out of me.
traffic cops don't do much of anything about that, though
we can see that there is no real correlation between the ratio of police officers and the homicide rate, for the big cities that there are already a lot of police officers.
you have to see what the objective is.
there, coderre said it would be necessary to decrease the shootings.
there are clearly a lot of guns entering montreal, but it goes through the reserves and the us border, so montreal has little power for that.
it leads to conflicts between gangs. this summer, there was shooting a few 100m from my home where i go regularly and which i see through my window.
they have a strong social media presence and they are not afraid of the police.
obviously, we need more community intervention and less poverty, to reduce crime, but we also need a good police presence to react.
it's not for the mafia to handle this.
so more police officers could help i think.
it's clear that i agree with the hiring of community police officers, but let's face it, it's an even more thankless job than regular cop. even the police officers who will specialize in community intervention (certificates and training) are still pitched in the “acab” pile which is odious.
yes, the acab targets all police officers, regardless of their responsibilities.
it dates from november 2020, but still:
[  
"mr. dorais spoke of the work carried out by the mobile reference and intervention team in homelessness (emrii) and by the psychosocial emergency support team (esup), made up of a duo (police officer and social worker) . the administration wishes to increase the resources of these teams. "
it can be difficult for a police duo to intervene because the person has an aversion to the police or just doesn't feel comfortable, even when the police would be able to help, but it can also being difficult for a duo of community workers for other reasons, so a duo of police and social worker, that has good potential.
over time, the reputation of the spvm may improve, but it is a difficult task.
those who are satisfied with the work of the police do not talk about it everywhere, but when there are problems, we hear a lot about it in the media and on social networks.
and there you go! what everyone suspected was true. thanks to the boss of cogir for his honesty!
my favorite passage: “the ceo of cogir also assures that he did not sign any confidentiality agreement with mr. coderre. "
surprised_pikachu
2017: denis lies about formula e.
2021: denis lies about his income.
denis 2.0 never existed and he risks losing again and he will only have himself to blame.
baon, you must feel lighter in my coderre ham.
how can you launch a campaign for the town hall and believe that this kind of detail will not explode in your face? ehh boy ...
he makes all the mess around him, he talks so much about himself. he enjoys talking about the good money he did in the private, and how happy he was making that money. his pubs have the huge face of him calling him passionate, competent and so on. then he complains that people are too focused on him and not on his plans about the city. when asked about such plans, he brings nothing. go figure.
well finally the cat is out of the bag. coderre and his little secretiveness, like formula e tickets ... but will that be enough to sink coderre on voting day? he knows very well that housing is an issue and that a good part of the voters does not take a favorable view of these mega corpos managers of housing stock ... for some it is like working "with the enemy" ...
it smells of carrion.
he could have said it from the start and sounded less dumb.
ciborium of tabarnak guys, ** go vote! **
chase the denis, he comes back at a gallop
thanks for the information, i will know better who to vote for.
another lie from coderre, had not signed a confidentiality agreement with cogir. wake up, the pro-coderre, t \ * brn \ * k!
hope this guy does not win. he is the very face of corruption in montreal. we do not need a mayor who is bought and paid for by developer scumbags
what we do not say enough is that he never speaks of a probable return of the exhibitions and especially of a stadium in the city center ish. but if he is elected, it will become his 3rd link. he will make it his spearhead. just like formula e.
to think i voted for him in 2014. i blame myself so much.
"the former mayor said he earned annually" at least twice as much "as the salary of the mayor of montreal (which was around $ 198,000 in 2020)." i made a lot of money. j 'was happy, "said denis coderre." so i can confirm that i am not coming back [to politics] for a question of money, i am coming back because i love montreal. ""
no my denis, it is the power that you love.
pft, it really sounds more like coderre who tried to get the ceo to release this. i mean the guy's only 2 quotes in the article are elevator return expectation love for denis.
i'm a supporter of projet montréal, and not surprised at all about this news. what i find odd is why this ceo would share this information, wouldn't he want coderre to win? doesn't he know this will probably help plante? seems to me, he probably wants plante to win. so maybe coderre isn't the only one making deals with his company?
"in the last six months of 2020 alone, it launched seven projects worth a total of half a billion dollars, reported la presse at the time."
he probably thinks pm will win and wanted them to be nice to him.
the question therefore arises: with what other companies has he not signed confidentiality agreements in the end? cogir are surely not the only ones! either coderre will have to name them, or they themselves risk doing so by the weekend
who do you think his hidden "consulting clients" are?  why do they deserve so much privacy?  it's so that we don't see -  he got rich by showing contractors how to get $$ from the city of montreal...that's what he's been up to.  now he wants to slide back in as mayor. awkward....
the great class of denis coderre, ladies and gentlemen.
the complaint turned out to be unfounded, the police held an investigation and closed the case without ever having thought of recommending the laying of charges, but the guy is an "alleged assailant" ... you have to believe that the internal polls are not too encouraging at the moment at ensemble montreal.
denis grasping at straws.
he's having negative publicity lately (and rightly so) so he figured he might as well do some dirty politics!
lol c not my candidates who are dla marde c yours!
[deleted]
but denis ** does not stop telling lies **! .... so is that true?
that said, it's really not ideal for plante three days before the poll (especially with misleading headlines like that which make the complaint look brand new).
and that's a little asterisk for me on sauvé's candidacy.
but hey, coderre has a gigantic one next to him so good.
qc125 released today that vp is ahead of dc (46% - 40%, 3% margin of error). that's what it is… highly the election, it's starting to really trawl the scrapyard.
"the investigator in the file confirms that the file is closed but adds that he was not able to exonerate sauvé"
it's the advisor himself who says it's unfounded, not the police. the police who close a file do not mean innocent, it can be for several reasons. it's hard to believe that if he didn't have anything there, why go to mediation?
but the question is immaterial. the point is that plante denies having knowledge, when several documents say that she knew.
it smacks of lived experience, poor you if it is.
and how is sauvé supposed to prove that something just didn't happen? this is why we have the presumption of innocence in society.
why go to mediation? because there may have been an incident, even though no criminal or immoral act was done. if i was accused of having assaulted someone when i was convinced that i had acted flawlessly, i too would go to mediation. misunderstandings happen.
and no, the question is not immaterial. there was never a formal complaint, and the accuser ceased all contact after the mediation meeting. you can't have more closed and classified as a file than that. plante replied that she was not aware of any active allegations, because it was so clear this story against sauvé was going nowhere.
weak sauce.
truly sad state of affairs when you have to choose between having workers that can possibly transmit a deadly virus to people with debilitated conditions and closing services due to the already shortstaffing of health facilities.
unvaccinated health workers are such an oxymoron it's unbelievable.
> unvaccinated staff will be obliged to get tested for covid three times a week, and those who don’t comply will be suspended without pay.
wonder what happens administratively if you do catch it
get the fucking shots, nurses. wtf.
the soft dough.
should all healthcare workers be vaccinated? of course. but could someone please explain to me how the lesser harm here is closing 600 hospital beds and 35 operating rooms (dube's numbers from october 15th), vs requiring the unvaccinated to get tested at their own expense? especially if we also require that any new hires be vaccinated, so this will sort itself out relatively quickly?
ciborium
if you don't believe in vaccines you have no business being a healthcare worker. i know we can't afford to let them go at the moment, but i'm also afraid of the harm these idiots will do in the long run... these people don't care about the safety of others (ironic given the field of work they've chosen) but we should care about their job security?
i guess i am ok with that.  that much testing seems like a waste, but there is a reasonable chance this will prevent people from spreading the disease.  i do think that patients should be informed if they have an unvaccinated medical worker, and be allowed to request someone vaccinated.
i mean they were in the heat of it for the passed 18 months and completely over worked, energy drained bodies sre easy to get sick and they didnt. not to mention they worked when there was no protection since the beginning. not to mention also they may have immunity already if they caught it, and can also have been asymptomatic.
if they tested for immunity looking at antibodies instead of saying only the vax works, this would be such an easier situation for the world.
we need an immunity pass and not a vax pass to get the economy moving.
caq government bunch of pussies
is it possible to buy rapid testing kits in montreal  as of right now?
dictatorship!!!!!
imagine overruling your government. #badass
i hope these dumb healthcare workers get punished once this pandemic ends or when we figure out a way to function within our healthcare system without making it a burden on us. these healthcare workers are basically blackmailing the rest of us knowing that we need them, and we actually do and appreciate their work. but once we can afford to, punishments should be applied.
i'm so surprised of the comments here. imagine being a nurse, having real and valid concerns of getting the vaccine, needing to feed your kids and the government lies to you by saying if you don't get vaccinated you're not getting paid. 
so with kids needing to be fed you go and get vaccinated against your will only to have the government say to you, ya no you don't need to actually and we never had the intent of implementation it from the get go it was just a way to force nurses to get vaccinated. 
how disgusting of our government to actually lie like that to our nurses. the disrespect for human rights is out of this world. i would be livid. how about you try to educate people and not force them or actually respect our nurses. 
this is insane, another lie of many from this administration over the last couple of years.
edit : the reason people are downvoting me is that they agree with wanting to get people vaccinated. but if it was something they didn't agree like for example everyone on the pill until 18 and the government forcing them to do that. they would agree with this exact post. it's not about the end goal or the motives, it's about lying, forcing people to do things against their will. government should not have this much power. just think if it was an issue you disagreed with. i don't think you'd appreciate the government forcing you to do something against your will.
but vaccinated staff can still transmit the virus so i’ve never seen the reason behind forcing healthcare workers to get vaccinated. they’re better off testing staff a few time a week, which sounds like the route they will take.
you get time off work, same as anyone else who gets covid (hopefully). the alternative is to directly incentivise people who are sick to come to work anyhow because they need to money, thereby spreading their germs.  
edit: this was a big driver of covid in ontario; there employees dont have a legal entitlement to sick days, so the most vulnerable financially would show up for work anyways and infect all their coworkers.
because it affects us on every level and will have a direct impact in our quality of life. you and your relatives will have delays in their testing appointments, eye surgeries, trauma incidents, heart transplants, or whatever medical issue high or low, covid-related or not without the staffing of the health care system. it takes people to run these operations and procedures. the network also extends to social services which includes but is not limited to child protection services, old people's homes, dependency, and mental health.
people aren't getting vaccinated for whatever reasons they have, we are at 97% vaccinated yet the issue here is removing the 3% unvaccinated will still deeply impact the system, which demonstrates the criticality to not mandate such a measure at this time.
vaccinated people can transmit the virus just the same as unvaccinated people so i don’t see your reasoning. testing staff is the way to go.
apparently to see air canada's performance the air service is not either
obviously he is english-speaking, so he is above all these trivial little hassles. it's just us little francophones who have the time to learn a second language. the gentleman is * busy *, you understand.
next time they ask for a bailout, respond in french.
also sure hope that kills any future transat merger
he has always lived in montreal without having to speak french, why should he? a real one!
it doesn't fly high as an attitude.
i was entitled to cancel for upcoming flights with air canada; i just did it and switched to air france, which offers a much better service anyway.
while we are tearing the shirt off with the fact that the ceo of aircanada does not speak french, the company has just announced that it will cancel certain orders of the a220 in favor of the 737max. hint: the a220 is made in montreal.
stop whining and take a flight from another company when possible.
send a copy of your ticket to monsieur thing.
money speaks.
lol. thinking about legault as air transat ceo.
sign my petition asking for his resignation :)
[deleted]
just move all offices to toronto like what the trend is among corporations nowadays and its not gonna matter if he speaks chinese.
who gives a shit what language a leader speaks of a company? if your going to be so up tight about it, stop using english branded things also. stop using facebook, twitter, instagram youtube its all run by english speakers. he’s there to serve share holders and managers not the public directly.
do you guys think a ceo has time to learn french? nope
it changes what seriously ... it is all the same not a doctor or a politician ..
that he does his job that's all!
so should all public companies require their executives to speak french? or maybe the ones with headquarters here?
[deleted]
the amount of energy some francophones in montreal spend on policing language while getting ravaged by taxes, poor social services and a terrible local economy that is all run by francophones is pretty hilarious
bail out given by federal govt.

well yes, we are cellars ... imagine "who" does not want to lift the confidentiality clause and "why" ...
it's not hard to imagine that the "who" is another real estate developer and the "why" is that he wants money from taxpayers.
i am not 100% for plante but this complete lack of judgment by coderre tipped the scales for me
she will have my vote
this is the second time in 24 hours that i have made this comment, even more appropriate today: “so much effort not to answer frankly.”
too late my denis, it was last week that we had to do that.
byebye
unbelievable.
too little too late, the damage is done for denis. he has clearly shown us that he is the same bossy liar as before.
too little too late denis.
y do more than i thought ... quite a bit more.
well you can't be mayor if you can't divulge all you potential conflicts of interest.  also you can ask the company that has your confidentiality agreement to release the information.  but i assume that is something he does not want.
i hope someone asks the question 'would you select a person for your administration that has potential conflict of interests?'.
too late. we already know that it will be rotten at the end
ayoye. rather than admit that he mismanaged this crisis, he says that it was the other party that wanted to dirty him. no, mr. coderre, it is all the voters who want to know what is going on and it took the threat of losing the elections for you to act. imagine what he will do when there is no longer the threat of losing an election ...
do you take us for the thick ones who would be manipulated so ridiculously by valérie plante?
what a two of spades who is not even able to take ownership of his mistakes. my vote is now decided.
nice.
bronfman
it's so satisfying to see this kind of demagogue go wrong for days right before the election.
he bet no media is going to find him in three days. i believe they will accept the challenge.
it was the advertising bags after all. it is all the same a good fit, denis coderre mascot of the publisacs.
i rather have the impression that it has more to do with a certain stadium for a certain baseball team.
if he had come out with this stupid apology, i might have been able to convince myself that it is not easy to lift as an agreement.
but there come on, you have to be brain dead to believe that all this is clear.
i don't see a metro ???
very interesting, thanks for sharing!
one hundred years later, everything between craig street (ajd st-antoine) and the line formed by dubord, vitré and jurors streets was demolished quite a bit to build a beautiful modern highway (ville-marie).
we can also notice that there is no rue berri which connects to rue de la commune. it is the construction of the viger station that will create this street.
> [rue berri takes its current form when, in 1895, land was expropriated for the construction of the viger station. this operation allows rue berri to be extended to rue de la commune by integrating rue saint-gilles.] (
what a great fucking news !! now, bring back the old name and old logo !!
i’ll never understand why they didn’t rebrand to olympique montréalais. it was so easy… and this decision was made right next to the olympic stadium.
we agree that calling your football team le clusterfuck de montréal was not the idea of the century.
damn it!
montreal fuck club.
totally out of the loop on this, what the backstory here?
it's been 45 years since the olympics and the team has no association to them.  i don't think that name would make much sense.
[deleted]
the montreal impact are now called fc montreal and everyone is pissed they killed the well loved name and logo. 
the logo is now literally a snowflake. dae canada cold !?!
a bunch of sports teams use the olympique in their name (marseille, gatineau, etc) more to symbolise the olympic spirit and athleticism of the team than relating to the actual olympics. for us it would just be a 2 for 1.
it is possible but i suspect it quite a bit. hard to believe that the cio gave permission to the city of gatineau lol
drives me nuts they aren't even "club de football de montreal" - it's *club de foot de montreal.* dumb.  
also, i agree they needed a logo change, but a damn snowflake? so dumb.
ha! why'd they change? i don't really follow the team, but i've never really liked that old logo honestly. 
i get team loyalty though, especially for people who have been there since the beginning.
you can't even start a new pizza shop called after the olympics since canada hosted its last olympiads. it would have been a lot of work. the name olympique has probably more a negative connotation in montreal than in the rest of canada because of the costs associated to the 76 games.
i didn't even realize that. really cements the cheap european wannabe vibe.
>why'd they change? 
to follow the naming convention of european team and appear more "serious": fc barcelona, f.c. united, real madrid c.f., paris saint-germain f.c., etc.
are you a joke? 53% increase in car theft and the spvm's solution is to give ticket tickets to the world that is not blocking their doors? wouldn't that tempt them to do their job and snatch the world that steals tanks instead?

there's your anti-vol calvaire!
moé i found the trick: since i caught the covid (at a demonstration by alex-chie crossette strudel), i no longer have a smell. so i sacred a big pile of poodle poo in front of the back bench of my new 6 month old tank. the ti-cass that will go in to steal it, i swear that will screech my tank there, because my wife guarantees me that it smells of carrion right in my tank. boom!
let me see one trying to steal my 2008 matrix!
"in a special case."
details?
ah calisse, i do not bar my doors since my tank has a convertible top ... i prefer it to go through the doors than through the roof to steal the $ 6 in the console.
seriously, i have a detachable steering wheel * i literally leave with the wheel. my car is not at risk of being stolen by asses.
worse, i live in verdun, ahahaha thank god that i didn't get a ticket
^ * my ^ car ^ has ^ never ^ had ^ airbags, ^ so ^ legally ^ i ^ can ^ change ^ the ^ steering wheel
is there a place we can go to get rid of my lemon?
i have a hard time believing that there is not a technological solution to this ... there is surely a way to build a receiver which can detect the abnormally strong signal from the repeaters? it would then suffice for the police to promise themselves in civilian clothes with in the hot corners. or better, that the key detects when its signal is repeated?
why is all the crime going up? what is going on? we need a solution
i received a ticket because my downstairs neighbor's garage had graffiti, nothing surprises me anymore ...
perhaps the tactic is to punish people to convince them to take justice into their own hands, like death wish?
i have already had a vehicle stolen and the policeman told me that the volume is so high that there is not much they can do.
oh my god so much. !!!!

the attack on keyless entry systems has been known for almost 10 years, but no one seems interested in talking about it.
i approach my vehicle with my key on me i pull the door handle to open. the car sends a radio signal to the key, and the key responds with a code to tell the vehicle that it is the correct key, so ok to unlock the doors. the key has a small battery, so the signal is not very strong, so the key must be close to the car for the car to receive the key response.
the attack consists of getting a small suitcase containing a battery and a radio of a particular type, but which anyone can buy. it takes two people to open the car. the first, with the suitcase, is placed closest to the keys, eg outside the door of the residence, or seated at a table next to the victim in the restaurant. the second will pull the vehicle's door handle. the vehicle then sends a signal to the key. the key responds with the correct code, but the signal does not reach the car because it is too far away. but if the suitcase is close enough, it "hears" the key signal and repeats it with a louder signal, which the vehicle can "hear", and the vehicle unlocks the doors. no alarm, no broken windows, and if anyone sees that, it looks like an owner opening their car, so nothing abnormal.
but if the keys are in a small, closed metal container, then no radio signal. to do the test, wrap your keys in aluminum foil and pull the car door handle with the keys in your pockets. the doors remain locked.
the article is very interesting and it also reminds me of my own city, washington dc here there are several old factories which are converted for other functions, like cinemas or stores. in my opinion, it is better to convert the interiors of factories than to destroy them to build a new modern building.
indeed! i spoke of washington in my text on industrial districts: 
we are not villages! a city should not be divided into 50 unrelated independent boroughs.
elsewhere in the news: volkswagen calls for buying german cars, saint hubert calls for eating chicken prepared in quebec
mad!!
montgomery would like that, she could place all her interns in positions of power
saint hubert is ontario
but the operations are managed in laval.
the title makes it a lot worse than it actually is.
"valérie plante truthfully claimed to have no knowledge of any credible sexual assault allegations against an elected official", it is not as seller as a title ...
“police closed their investigation in 2021, six months after the mayor's response to allegations.” so when she said she wasn’t aware of a sexual assault investigation she was lying?
exact. reading the headline this morning, i got the impression it was the same type as the scandals in the canadian military. but not at all.
from what i understood, the internal discussions with the complainant were over at that time, after a mediation process in particular. the manager at pm allegedly told the complainant's lawyer to go and file a complaint with the police and had no response thereafter for 2 years.
but yes, it's not an ideal situation. and projet montréal could have taken some responsibilities away from craig sauvé while waiting for the situation to be resolved. personally, i would hate to be in his district and have to vote for him.
it's just that the title of the article suggests much worse stuff. like plante hid a "rozon" type affair in his team.
eric strikes again
could the same kind of appeal work against universities?
i have a child in the public and one in the private. by far, the private sector was better during class closures, for content, use of technology, availability of teachers. the private school was able to react much more quickly and with more foresight. she told the children to bring all their belongings home the day before schools close during the first wave before it was even officially announced, provided access to digital versions of textbooks, found teaching videos etc. ...
no, it was not the same level of service as normal. but it was light years from the public where there was nothing for too long. the gap was even bigger a year later because the private had more practice and learned from the first wave. no regrets on my part anyway!
already these parents are throwing their money out the window to send their kids to the private sector, to follow the same school program, worse than in the professions, being a private or public graduate doesn't change anything ...
i have 1 child in the public and 1 in the private because complicated reasons and ... fuck the public. 5 different teachers in 1 year, my child is bored to death because the lessons are too easy not to fail children who should not be in regular class, a lot of violence in the corridors and the schoolyard and the school principal who does not care royally. ah yes and her very last teacher speaks with such a strong accent that i have difficulty understanding her so imagine children trying to learn vocabulary.
> worse than in the professions, being a private or public graduate doesn't change anything
it definitely has an impact to enter certain quota programs in certain cegeps.
it's not like that in all public schools, and it's not all private schools that are good (strong drugs in high school, a kid who has too much misery or who has problems will crown it outside, etc.) .
i hate people who paint an image like this of all the public schools in quebec.
> too easy not to fail children who should not be in regular class
what are you talking about? there is a ministerial program as well as a uniform examination for several subjects ... i have regular students last year who would have easily been in the jeans tops.
> a lot of violence in the hallways and in the schoolyard
ahh the american movie myth that students have shanks and go through metal detectors in the morning! the biggest violence i have seen this year is a frustrated student who kicked a box after an intervention.
i can talk to you about the private sector too: private schools which dismiss teachers for union activities, which deny access to sn math exams to certain students to ensure that they will not lower the school average, classes of 40 students, privileges to students whose parents donate more to the school, etc.
i'm talking about doctors, lawyers, etc. because the studies for these fields it is in advanced studies that it is played, therefore private or public at the elementary-secondary level, that makes no difference.
i'm wrong pe, but it seems to me that you don't really have a choice for your public school, do you? your address dictates which school your child will attend. in this context i understand 100% wanting to send your child to the private sector (and i come from the public).
[
maybe it's not the time to laugh at "shanks" at public school ...
the quality of your high school education has a huge impact on your chances of success in graduate school.
there are 4,000 students in marianopolis and 25,000 (11,000 in dawson city and 7,000 each in ja and vanier) in the english-speaking public, but the private cegep has more graduates admitted in medicine and law.
and from my experience in a public cegep, most of the students come from either private or public exam schools.
you can go to a school other than the one in your neighborhood if you go to a particular program (sports studies, theater, etc.)
and if you live on the border of two school boards, you can't send your child to school on foot because you're not on the right side of the boulevard, you have to send him miles away ...
indeed, i think that the private sector can become an alternative to a public school which is not doing very well. still my daughter is going to law (she is 19 years old), she did all her school in the public, and she farts in advanced studies. so .... 😎
> the young man was stabbed in the upper body and then took refuge in a school
moreover, if we want to play this:  teens-plead guilty
if public school were a sufficient condition for failing in life, quebec would not be in a bad mood ... but that does not mean that the private and the public are the same or that the private is is throwing his money out the windows.
and do you think it's comparable to a murder?
> or that the private sector is throwing your money out the window
i agree with you! if it was a different program that produced graduates superior to those of the public, i wouldn't say that. i know it's a choice ... but i've never seen a real long-term advantage of sending his kid to the private sector (except maybe if he shares the same values of certain bourgeois parents and / or disconnected from reality).
> the young man was stabbed in the upper body and then took refuge in a school
to be sure that we have read the article correctly.
go read a bit about school management. they reinstated the students in august. you try to avoid seeing the major problems that we find so much if not more in private schools. especially since you don't answer any of my other points.
with the holidays coming up, there will be plenty of local christmas markets.  maybe look in to getting a table at one or two nearby?
[evelyne boutique]( on sherbrooke st in ndg might be a good place to start. otherwise there will be plenty of christmas craft fairs and markets where you can rent a table to sell directly to the public.
there's boutique tah-dah! near jean talon market. there's also another boutique on st. hubert plaza that sells  locally made stuff.
looks up puces pop; they organise several artisanal events throughout the year. you just missed autumn's but they usually have one around the holidays if sign ups haven't ended.
consignment shops are probably your best bet. i'd hit up a bunch of boutiques up and down st-laurent and mont royal.
keep track of inventories, i've had a few places or flake, close down, or not keep accurate inventories/accounting.
try local cafes! i'm in homa and i know the woman who runs the cafe closest to my house is very open to helping out local artists. not in your area, but i'm sure other cafes would be amenable to it!
if you want to tap in to the online market you can try the site etsy. it’s great to sell handmade stuff and art.
oh that’s a great idea. any particular market name i can google?
seconding this. they sell only goods made in canada and many are local and artisanal.
they're often held in community centers.  i've been to markets in brossard, repentigny and anjou.  try looking at the websites for nearby community centers or search google for borough name + christmas market.
i know there's usually one at the church by metro laurier

so beautiful! 🤩
what’s the location for this photo?
prettyyyy
i've seen a lot of pics of vieux port on this sub and i must say, i really like this one!
i hear the restaurants are great and guests can open all the windows and it's just like eating on the street in open air like is often popular in europe.. i bet it improves the scene for downtown tours!

so much effort not to answer frankly.
the pressure is starting to rise. it looks like the fe saga
** quite a bluff ... lawyers are bound to secrecy **
so coderre could tell him that he works for the taliban or for the devil himself and the lawyer could not tell anyone.
coderre's actions are exactly what one would expect to see from a mafia godfather ...
denis who wanted to leave politics after his defeat in 2017. and now he comes back, but to represent the economic interests of those who convinced him to return to politics. get lost denis.

we can spare him that no problem.
he especially does not want the public to know ...
so don't want it before but will there want it after? wtf? b \ * llshit!
he's like that. it was the same with the cell phone while driving case. denial, denial, denial.

i can confirm this was done for me a few years ago. results are amazing! this dude is the best :)
its the best christmas gift you can offer family members, plus everyone gets a copy to bring home! had it done by another dude a few years back for xmas. great idea
i had a few mini dv tapes transferred a couple of years ago. results varied because of the age of the tapes, but everything came out as good as the tapes were. this guy is providing a great service so get it while you can.
long shot, but can you do u-matic?
can you digitize vhs tape?
very based.
would definitely recommend /u/psychyyz services to anyone looking to get their old tape content into a digital format.  super quick turnaround (was for me at least) and great results.
i might have a few mini dvs. i'll dm tonight.
wait will you digitize super 8?
i believe what i have are compact vhs tapes. i understand that is not what you are offering but what if i still had the original camcorder? could it be used to play the footage so that it could be digitized?
sent a dm!
hey! i want to surprise mom and dad by digitizing their wedding video. would that be possible?
(sry for bad english, 2nd language) wow op.... i'm just here to say that that i am absolutely in awe with your idea. i've scrolled through your posts from the previous years and i just love the idea of doing something you are good at for free during the holiday  season. especially since your actions are related to bringing back memories to life... inspired by your post, i'm actively trying to find something i could do for free for my neighbours or online... i'm not sure yet. my skillsets are mainly manual labour and computers... anyone has an idea?
i've got some reels which i think are 8mm, but not entirely sure. i'll dm you as i've been hoping to digitize them for a while
thanks to freelancers working for peanuts, or free, in your case, most audio-video related business is closed down.... only lozeau is left in that field.
at least, you're not working from india... i hope.
thanks.  that's actually how this all started.  a buddy had some tapes, but the camera was long dead.  ebay to the rescue, and for $160, i got an old 8mm video deck from sony.  after i digitized the dozen videos, i didn't want to toss the deck out, so i put it in storage.  i bust it out and set it up when i have the time, and offer to help rescue family memories from dead formats.  :)
(sry bad english) can confirm! my father-in-law digitized old tapes from the 1960's starring the family's grandpa combing and puting pomade in his hair before a romantic date. it was *kinda* colorized too.  he screened it as a surprise on christmas eve 3 or 4 years ago.  granpa was there.  
the -now- old man looked so handsome in his prime time. who would have known?   it also showed the streets of montreal with all those nice cars. he cried and we also all cried a little (even me even if i did not know him very well). we didnt know then, but it was a couple of months before his passing. thanks to this digitized tape i'll remember him forever as that handsome and hip 19 y/o man.  
 i still consider myself blessed to have witnessed this moment.
op has no idea how profound memories he's creating with this initiative. (or may be he does..) thank you. :)
it's actually pretty easy and reliable with dv, since, as the name suggests, it's already digital.
i'll make you the same offer i'd made others who have asked for other formats -- if you can find and buy the device, i'll do the digitizing for you, and i *may* offer to buy the unit from you, or you can resell it.
edit:  there's a few for sale, but nothing nearby...  
edit2: 
here's the snag with vhs...  the camcorder formats have things like birthdays, family vacations, and holidays on them -- and most vhs tapes are full of low-quality recordings of 80's tv that you can buy on dvd or stream from youtube.
so i focus on the formats for which finding players is very difficult.  you can still buy vhs-to-dvd units, so that's probably your best way forward.
still breathtaking the amount of media attention this man received during this campaign, especially when his party's platform boils down to sowing linguistic discord and selling neo-partitionist snake oil with a "city-state" flavor at a grassroots level. election probably fooled on these issues.
if his goal is to prepare the ground for a federal political career, he will have succeeded from a to z. what a way to make himself known, let's face it.
"let's start a language war because people in montreal live together peacefully and it's boring"...
\- balarama holness
he is completely ignorant of the history of the people who fought precisely for their metropolis to represent them.
i messed around with this guy a lot during the campaign but without joke i can't believe how lost he is. it is screeching in the field.
anglos who consider themselves a minority in canada is absolutely ridiculous.
rebellion implies we’re suffering grave injustices, which we aren’t.
> "believes that he can be" the knight of the integration of newcomers ",
his ego is really disproportionate. also, it’s so funny to him
exactly. i’m still unclear what we are supposed to be rebelling against?
-i'm a shit fucker.
he’s so annoying, can’t wait until these elections end
who is he ?
my brain read "religion" instead of rebellion.
it worked for mélanie joly anyway.
right, you really have to be special to be in a 99% english-speaking continent and think of yourself as a rebel by fighting for english in the only non-english-speaking metropolis.
much of what he says is ridiculous, but he gets a lot of attention for acknowledging that anglophone quebecers are a minority in quebec distinct from the rest of english canadians.
hmmmm
clearly calling it a "rebellion" is hyperbole but it's about the slow but steady erosion of the rights of anglo and allophone montrealers.
he's not going to go back to regular, anonymous life after this. 
get used to a decade or more of him stumbling through politics in the region...
a caricature of a mcgill student
but mélanie joly's father was the former liberal party financier ... you can tell i'm a conspirator, but i think mélanie joly ran for town hall more as a way of being able to distance herself from her father (somehow). sort). for the public, she was no longer a connected socialite, but a former candidate for mayor. in addition, she had to gain regardless of the scenario: either she became mayor, or she could go to the federal government by camouflaging herself behind her municipal campaign.
well yes the most oppressed minority in the world with its own hospitals and universities and it's own neighborhood of castles named westmount.
in a province where they study on taxpayers funded tuition to leave as soon as they have a diploma, in which they are represented at the house by the oldest and largest political party of the province.
truly, balarama is a necessary voice for the unheard.
there is no such thing as an erosion of rights of the anglophones.
yup, definitely not voting for denis coderre.
lagacé's text, which i can't share here:
personally, for whom he worked, it is not important. his taxes either. it is more its "transparency" of coderre 2.0 that should be put forward. it looks even worse than before.
for transparency, we will go back to my denis 2.0
politics in the last 10 years has gotten really pathetic.  it used to be that when a politician had a conflict of interest they would either (1) remove the conflict of interest through something like a blind trust (2) explain specifically how the conflict is not a conflict and let the voters decide (3) feel some sort of shame and leave the race for 'personal reasons'.
now they just don't answer the questions and make up excuses, and it seems to be somewhat working.
wow! we are not allowed to post 2 different opinions on the same subject on / r / montreal.
why is no one talking about the fact that balarama holness refused?
answer: not for the naive who voted for him.
calisse, yé readu laite tabarnak
for citizens let's see ...: o / s
even if i don't agree with everything valérie plante does, i will never vote for coderre! everything is wrong with him, all the time.
why does this guy keep running for office?
you'd think he'd have gotten the message back in 1990 when gilles duceppe clobbered him in a then-liberal stronghold.
not poor people
câline montreal shit us so not in shovel fuck coderre.

fake news, alternative facts, you're asking because you hate me, look over there, building's on fire.
you published [2 similar opinions] (
> “absolutely! we must ensure that all montrealers feel at home. let us invest in culture and the francophonie. let newcomers, immigrants, people from all walks of life be included in this culture. and so, let the french language belong to everyone, so that no one feels excluded. by creating a mosaic of people who consume culture and the francophonie, we will protect it.
also holness: no need to speak french in montreal.
hypocrite.
it's obvious, everyone knows that the best keeper of a chicken coop is a fox ... / s
is this like texas letting anti-abortion punishment in the hands of citizens?
so, are we doing like in 1970?
awful person
[deleted]
the only people that seem to gatekeep french are the francophones that almost hate that they're quebecers.
you know the ones that will switch to english as soon as someone has a hint of an accent when speaking french. but the former usually speaks worse english than the latter speaks french 😂
>by creating a mosaic of people who consume culture and the francophonie, we will protect it.
oh yes, to protect the francophonie, one of the only capitals of the quebec nation with a worldwide influence should have a special status which undermines its acquired linguistic rights.
so french doesn’t belong to everyone, all of the sudden you want to gatekeep french?
the world changing languages is out of kindness and to help the other person as best as possible.
this is what happens when you are in the minority on the continent.
i crossread the article too fast. i take back what i said.
and that those who do not speak your language are all big racists who work for air cacanada
stop it though.
here’s what gets to me, french is a beautiful language, i want it to flourish as a language in quebec, in montreal and hopefully in the roc. but when people start gatekeeping it, and then wonder why no one wants to learn to integrate, maybe we need to take a step back and revaluate our strategy. whether or not you agree with balarama his statement does have merit, it belongs to everyone. even those who reside outside of montreal. bonne chance pour nous, nous sommes dans une position avantageuse comparer à toronto à cause de notre multiculturalisme et les plusieurs langues qu’on parle dans la région métropolitaine.
no one is really saying that french does not belong to everyone.
and i think you have a wrong understanding of multiculturalism.
the guy had deleted his comment. and why do you think my view of multiculturalism is bad?
why not add alot more? have every cop carry one!
oufff only in black neighborhoods. how about in old port where there were plenty of shootings as well ?
any being set up outside snc lavalin hq?
lots of serious crime has originated in their area over the years...
even when you are not looking at the police, the police are looking at you.
the uk has the most cctv cameras installed in the world. so by the spvm's logic, the uk is effectively crime free?
a camera in front of chez parée and the 8 others inside
acab.
apart from the party which degenerated in may / june, what are the other shootings that have taken place at the old man?
i'm just asking here, but given that the old port belongs to the feds, is it possible that it's already equipped with security cameras provided by the canadian government?
who say there are no cameras in that area ?
exactly.  in this whole debate on criminality the big fat fish are overlooked, while the mme/mr toulemonde are subject to facial recognition, and 'preventive policing'.  clearly racial and class-bias apply - to the degree that a notoriously prejudiced police force and fat-cat politicians are behind the controls. for example coderre refuses to show who his "consulting clients" are... let's be honest, his "consulting" = showing contractors how to grab some of the 7billion$ mtl budget. that won't show up on these street-level security cameras...

not really, people are sensationalizing the shit out of a few violent incidents cause they're bored and want to feel american.
keep calling the police. saaq gives no fucks, neither does the city. eventually the police will start ticketing
call the police every day, eventually they will be tired of you calling and take care of it.
leave a passive aggressive note on the windshield. " dear neighbour, i'd like to thank you for your civility and not being a selfish douchbag that keeps their car alarm blaring all day. it's very kind of you to share the wonderful symphony with us all as it helps me relax and not get distracted by my annoying work. i'm pretty certain that some of your neighbours who work nightshift appreciate it more than me but are probably too exhausted to leave a thank you note. i bet you also share your music on the bus and metro too. may the fleas of a thousand camels infest your armpits. bless."
burn it
it's so weird that 911 is the way to complain about cars here. was looking online how to get a car that had parked in front of my driveway towed and it directed me to 911. 
best of luck with your neighbours junk mobile.
we're probably neighbour. we called the police, they came but the alarm didn't ring at that moment so they left ...   
the car didn't park on our street since then but we had planned to put the following note on it:   
\> hi  
\> we have two babies that hardly sleep. our life is already miserable, but your car makes it worse every single night.   
\> we're very patient, but you know ... if we have to choose between passing our nerves on our kids or on your giant can on wheels, we'll choose the right thing to do.  
\> wanna avoid it?   
\> disable your alarm  
\> seriously, it does nothing. it's been ringing for the whole night serveral days in a row: did people came to see if it were to be stolen? no. nobody will ever do such a thing.   
\> see? it serves no purpose and never will, so disable it.   
\> love xoxo
justify the alarm by smashing the windows
take video evidence add date/time within the video
just put a note (in french) on the windshield. no need to be nasty. i’m sure the owner of the car is not  setting off their alarm on purpose. they could just need a new battery. i don’t agree with a call to 911 for this. 
i’m not reading much compassion in these suggestions.
yeah just leave a note on the car saying you can't work because of the alarm
have it towed
514-280-2222 police line for non-emergency events. 
they should take your complaint and all the info.
is it a ford?
lol what’s the saaq going to do
911 is for when someone is about to die, they are not the cops. don't abuse it. just call the police in your borough. they have a phone number like any other services.
move to the suburbs and buy a house in the woods.
drop the mic
great, thank you!
good idea!
hahaha! fleas of a thousand camels is great xd writing this down now!
yo that's my curse. you owe me 2 goats for copyright infringement.
where's the best location(s) to stay?  
what kind of feel are you going for? do you want the feel of the big city? or do you want to go grab a coffee from a local cafe on the streetcorner and eat a croissant while enjoying the neighbourhood life? (plateau / mile end)  
how to do public transportation?  
stm pass for the week + busses and metro will get you everywhere you need to go in the city. city has a very good cycling network and it's a great way to get from neighbourhood to neighbourhood. you can cycle from the west island all along the lachine canal to downtown, and from downtown all the way to the north end of the island. you'll see a lot. bixi's are available for cycling, and while i've never used one personally as i own a bike, tons of people throughout the city use them constantly.  
must try restaurants that i should book in advance?  
there are so many byobs, and so many good new restaurants popping up you could spend a week researching and still not have decided where to go. chinatown has some amazing food obviously, cote des neiges has some amazing international smaller restaurants, plateau and mile end has toooons of restos, all with their own flavour. downtown you'll get the more run of the mill, vanilla restaurants that cater to everyone, and the old port you'll pay a premium as it's the most touristy area of the city.  
cafes or places for working/studying in?  
around the university areas you'll get your regular student cafes (cotes des neiges for u de m, downtown around rue university / rue guy / rue atwater for mcgill and concordia). the plateau and mile end have cafes literally every second street corner, park avenue and st. denis and st. laurent (the main) are chuck full of cafes and bars and boutiques. check out rue prince arthur near uqam for more student friendly life as well. old port will have various cafes for working professionals as well, just depends what vibe you're going for. you can always head to the concordia university libraries (downtown or at the loyola campus) and work there, no one will bat an eye so long as you aren't disruptive.  
recommended attractions and attractions to avoid?  
again, depends what you're looking for! old port is fun, and unique. the views from mt. royal are very nice, especially in the fall. if you want kitschy-er stuff there's always the orange julep, big o, biodome, planetarium, science center, insectarium. musée des beaux arts is normally good. we've got tons of shows and venues for whatever you might seek. rue ste catherine for shopping. eaton's center + the underground shopping mall. my favourite thing to do when visiting new cities is to just walk around and get the feel of the city. try walking st. denis or st. laurent, mont-royal avenue, ste catherine's for the downtown core. rue bernard in outremont. then there's the plethora of parks to visit. jean drapeau, mont-royal, laurier, parc lafontaine, westmount park (rue sherbrooke in westmount also has a distinct feel).   
is it worth visiting other areas via train, like ottawa or quebec city?   
as a native montréaler? no. lol. but yes they do have distinct feels, which are very much not montreal. ottawa is becoming more hip and happening, quebec city has some charm, but is very much a large village in my opinion. day trips to either could be fun, but there's nothing in either of those places that i find montréal doesn't do better... if you really wanna do a day trip, maybe check out the surrounding area. montréal is so fortunate to have so many different areas just a few hours away for hiking, spas, mountain biking, boating, country drives etc. magog, rawdon, eastern townships, lachute. might be more interesting because it'll be more "different" than simply going to visit ottawa or quebec.
regarding public transit: all stm passes are good for both bus and metro across the entire island of montreal. the exception is the 747 bus to and from the airport, which requires minimum a one day pass to board.
if you plan to use the public transit system frequently, it may be worth it to buy an opus card from any metro station or dépanneur (convenience store) for $6 and use that to get weekly or unlimited fares. since you are here between months, i can't recommend a monthly pass unfortunately as those are aligned to the month only.
the train on island and off-island public transit systems are different than the stm and requires different fares. this includes metro stations on the orange and yellow lines that are off-island! off-island metro stations are where it gets confusing. you can arrive at any metro station any any stm fare, but you can only use a single or 2 pack fare to get back into the metro in laval and longueuil. for example, if you bought a 10-pack of tickets and try to board at longueuil, you'll get an error and have to buy a separate single ticket. check the stm fare list for which ones are valid, but if you stick to the island of montreal then you never have to worry.
you don’t need a membership for crew, there is a normal cafe (that gets super crowded, be forewarned!) and then rooms that you reserve - i’ve never reserved a space, maybe that’s what the membership is for?
i’m from toronto and i would drive to montreal to eat the tasting menu at bouillon bilk. 8 courses for like $115. everything is always amazingly delicious. there’s also l’express that you must try.
>bixi's are available for cycling, and while i've never used one personally as i own a bike, tons of people throughout the city use them constantly.
bixi season ends on november 15th usually.
there are scandals with practically everyone with whom he has associated. it is mongolian that he is equal to plante in the polls. this guy is not straight.
"yes but if i am elected, i show you how rich i am!"
those teeth, pity! that's all i can see! ditto on campaign photos i have the impression of seeing jim carrey in the mask
i hate it so much when people tell me about the money they make. i always retract on myself.
worse, that's exactly why i hate it. there is nothing noble about being full of cash. it is often done in a shady way. you're no better, you have plenty of money, in fact, there is a good chance that you are filthy or that you do something filthy.
i have a friend who told me about the profits he was making with cryptocurrency, and it depresses me that encouraging a full not green business in the same way pays off.
worse if we talk about salaries, it is often completely random. i was killing myself body and soul when i was teaching to help immigrants learn french and be comfortable here. there were some who stayed after class and cried as they told me about their lives. it was a job that i considered important (but i let go of pcq i was still burned out oops). now i'm going into it and i can make more money doing something more "mundane" and working less hard.
in any case, sorry for this great speech of social justice on this tuesday morning. the vigilante in underwear you thing.
he really has teeth to bite a whole melon this one.

this guy better not win.
for all of plante's flaws, at least she has a clear plan and actually wants to make montreal somewhere people want to live in and choose to stay in. coderre wants to make the city cater to people who commute in for work and leave right after. guess that shows his supporters do not live in the central boroughs and how out of touch he is with the city he was once mayor of.
he's also mega corrupt and a pathological liar.
it's okay if he likes guys, don't judge.
he's a good boulechiteur, you have to give him that.
montreal smog affects memory and the brain, it seems.
yeh seems like i keep hearing stories of coruption and embarrassing behavior from people he associates with, i have no idea why anyone would vote for him ..
"i promise you"
the middle line of his teeth is not in the center too. on the contrary side to your cruise.
not sure why anyone's surprised, if you can't find affordable comfortable housing for a whole family, there's no real reason to stay in montreal.
> according to figures obtained by la presse, they are 4,500 fewer than last year in schools in the metropolis. an unforeseen phenomenon that clashes with the situation in the suburbs and in certain regions, including the laurentians and lanaudière, where there are more and more students.
> in school service centers where the number of students is decreasing, there could be a financial impact, confirms the fédération descentres de services scolaire du québec. "for certain budgetary envelopes, funding is granted per student"
ah, ok. so we are understaffed of teachers, and if there are fewer students this is not good news, on the contrary, it will imply a decrease in budgets. are the protozoa at the head of this system still looking in the mirror?
it should be noted that the closing of the borders plays a role in this. fewer newcomers, who often settle in montreal.
> this increase in pupils was largely due to the arrival of many asylum seekers and to immigration. however, the number of students in reception classes has halved since the 2018-2019 school year. only at the cssdm, they are 700 less than last year.
watch the shortage of teaching staff settle a little more towards the suburbs.
according to the director of the cpe, this is the one and only reason why i managed to get a place before the baby entered kindergarten. so ... yeah?
the article accuses teleworking and the decline in immigration, but we should not neglect the health aspect in my opinion. without the cultural and festive life we once knew in montreal, what remains to attract young families?
in my opinion, an extension (even justified) of health measures over time will have a devastating impact on the demography of cities. we will waste decades in revitalization progress.
your son has a better chance of becoming a poppy bum of speed if he's in the suburbs.
also, most enterprises have gotten more comfortable with work from home alternatives. so if you don't have to show up to an office every day, that's one less reason to be staying in montreal.
it's not entirely a money issue.  i'm looking to live off-island because i've had it with the orange cones, construction and traffic.  my family hates driving into montreal to visit because it's just so frustrating to drive in.
they have young kids so it's just not practical for a family to move around by metro/bus/bike.
not only that, there's much less stress raising a family on the outskirts of the big city.
if i had a car, id move on the northern crown myself!
you mean the bike lanes aren't reason enough?
so much the better. class groups are going to be fewer on the island and that's perfect. in primary school my children's groups never exceeded 25 students while their cousins' classes in the suburbs were close to 35 and it was a blessing. the high school of my youngest is made to accommodate 1800 students and they are not even 700. the big peace.
in marieville, the high school added pcq trailers there was not enough room for so many students.
absolutely, yeah. and hold on to your butt! not being dragged around for hours a day in a chariot is a blessing for children. go to school on foot, know your city, be able to have a job at the end of high school and cegep without needing a car, know the neighborhoods, have landmarks, develop your cultural interests, go out with friends and take your first brushes (!) without going to kill yourself in a tank, etc. our guys often thank us for not going to the suburbs. their friends from 450 who come to visit them and go out are very envious of them.
there's the monetary aspect too. i was in griffintown, in a condo, i have a child so we were looking for something other than a condo. no way that will pay $ 1.1 million and more for a townhouse in little burgundy.
> without the cultural and festive life we once knew in montreal, what is left to attract young families?
not much remains. i know a lot of people, myself included, who have decided not to stay on the island. after being dragged around for 2 years with all the high cost in town without any of the perks that came with it before, fuck it.
what?
just a friendly note to say there are plenty of families who use metro, bus and bike to move around in montreal! it’s actually very possible especially with communauto for the odd time when only a car will do the job.
you are right, parents and kids hate bike lanes… they don’t want children to bike safely downtown because all children drive cars anyway

a real shame that when we were to remake the metropolitan, we chose to redo it identically. we are now stuck with this plague until 2070 surely. the metropolitan, décarie and ville marie highway should be transformed into boulevards or buried in tunnels in my opinion.
function before look, please. the most frustrating with the 40 is still crossing it (on foot or by car) without being caught in the traffic trying to get on it.
there are surely a few mitigation measures to be taken which will serve to improve the experience of passers-by (lighting, decor, signage), however, plants are not the trolls and cannot survive under bridges, in darkness, in drunkenness. salt spray. i am all for vegetalization. more important are the right conditions for growth and maintenance please (often two sadly overlooked elements in projects).
i love the idea! the mile end skatepark which can be converted into a place of spectacle is very successful. to do something similar in this dreadful place would be a blessing.
it's true that it's ugly in tabarnak, it looks like it's missing a piece all along
very good idea. a little painting and lighting would do a lot of good.
i am not against.
and coderre who wants to make another scar in the east of montreal.
i think it has to remain a highway. burying it is probably the best option, although it is a huge project. i doubt that a government in the near future will agree to finance this project ...
edit: it would seem that a tunnel is not possible, since it is forbidden to transport explosives or products under pressure in a tunnel (understandable).
i personally hope especially that they will rethink the service road. i live very close to the highway and in the end, it's not the 40 that causes me the most inconvenience (yes, there's a little noise, but it's okay), it's the boulevard crémazie which is horribly poorly designed for pedestrian transit.
it's a group that offers such a project! of course this is at the conceptual stage and no cost estimate has been made, but one can still dream.
the article uses the term reconstruction which is not really accurate. it is a major repair, several elements will remain in place, but others must be redone because they are severely degraded.
don't, don't, don't, don't, don't!
you have to spend a lot of money on transport without improving it.
this is ecological!
are you talking about the van horne viaduct next to the rosemont metro station?
if so, the metropolitan has the disadvantage of being surrounded by service roads. and we can see what happens with the park which replaces the bonaventure expressway, apart from being beautiful in photos, it is not really pleasant to walk there.
it's not possible to bury the décarie and the metropolitan. trucks which transport dangerous products, especially explosives, cannot go into tunnels.
> i doubt that a government in the near future will agree to finance this project ...
the main problem is that this kind of money would be more useful elsewhere. like our collapsing schools, public transport, etc.
> the boulevard crémazie which is horribly poorly designed for pedestrian transit.
oui. i live around st laurent/cremazie and have to cross cremazie every day to get to work. the fact that pietons have to push a button to cross (that doesn't work 50% of the time) sucks. because even with the signal to walk... drivers are still given the right to do a right turn at the same time, and they don't give a fuck if they hit you. and then you're stuck under the overpass because the first button doesn't sync with the other side so that you can get get across cremazie in one shot.
very anxiety inducing.
i also used to live on the corner of st hubert and cremazie and the noise made me want to rip my hair out. we had to move.
yes a thousand times. the overhead structure is ugly and noisy, but it is crémazie that is really horrible and dangerous for pedestrians and cyclists.
we see that this is a very serious group when their contact email address is a gmail address.
info.alliium@gmail.com
i can't speak for the corner of the bonaventure expressway, but i live close to the 40 in villeray and clearly, even if the traffic will remain heavy on the service roads, the whole could be much more pleasant for pedestrians in particular. (which are more numerous than one thinks, in particular because of the station crémazie). for now, it is horribly difficult to cross if you are not in a chariot, despite the large number of pedestrians / bicycles that pass there very often.
also, the parking lots below the highway are underutilized and some could clearly be converted to something more user-friendly (although we sure don't necessarily want to chill there).
a friend saw them in the old metropolis and told me that while the music remains interesting, it was like watching boomers playing minesweeper on their computers.
covid isn't finished yet i still haven't left my house since march 2020
nice
oh yeah!
pity! there is a way to make a music show like this interesting though. i went to see jean-michel jarre and everything that was electronic drum in the tunes was performed live by 2 musicians on "real" midi drums instead of a small box. in short, it was a lot hotter than a dude in front of a keyword.
[these are robots] (
but i just might get vaccinated and go see kraftwerk #worthit
phew, it's not very nice.
i remember when you didn't even have to dial 514 to make a call, the numbers were only 7 digits.
also, when called from shore to shore was a long distance.
514, 450, 438, 263
loving the continuity
are we demonstrating as a big gang to change 263 for 666?
263-254-6011 now i understand
this is what happens when you buy a cell phone for every member of the family, even the dog and the goldfish.
263 555 1212, toé pis moé it's wonderful
i love the antiquated phone used as thumbnail, that's how long ago i cared about phone numbers.
do you mean all 9,999,999 numbers possible with 514 are taken? why do that? i already know that the answer to my question is no
to sex thee
*laughs in 514 number while living in the boonies*
ok.
*"two sicks. reeeeeeee!!!"*
totally agree.
yesiiii! also reminds me that in the evening it was cheaper.
cibole that we were getting stuffed without knowing it. now it's cellular data plans.
but can we have [an easy-to-remember emergency number] (
if you count the 450, don't forget the 579 in this case!
450 is outside the island
666 is not assigned, but it is reserved.
must report 263-937-0707
>are always trying to barge onto the metro before you can even exit
i don't know about the seats thing but this is 100% true. it'd be easier to get on if you let everyone off first
there's even lines painted on the floor clearly indicating, people who want to get on wait to the side and let people exiting out the middle first
and i think there were signs before but now most of the signage is probably about covid
as someone who spent 6 months with crutches and had a pregnant girlfriend i can confirm the seat thing! i don’t recall how many times i heard the bus driver yell « i am not starting the bus until someone leaves him a seat »
never had that issue. people always gave their seats whenever i’ve been on. (20 years of public transit using mainly blue, green and orange lines)
the one annoying thing is people(on and off the train) who block you while trying to get out of the train. i push them out of the way. someone’s gotta give.
it wasn't that bad pre covid. it's like the city forgot how to metro.
when this kind of dumb shit happens, i stop moving and just stand there. i make absolutely zero effort to move or accommodate the person being ridiculous. it's socially awkward, but that's the point.
most realize what they're doing and fix their behaviour, but sometimes not. this one time i was exiting, this one girl was trying to maneuver around me to get on the train and let out of a "move!" out of frustration before pushing through. i heard her friends scolding her on my way out.
fuck these people.
speaking as a man born and raised in montreal who lived in every area of the city : montrealers have no manners.
i don't move out of the way of people when i walk off the metro. if you're in my way as i'm trying to exit, you're going to have to move. 
the background is that montrealers are selfish lol.
i was yelled at by two elderly women (different days) for offering them my seat. i guess i made them feel old? i was just trying to be polite.
the staff are so rude too. i've never encountered so many rude drivers anywhere else. overall, it's a really good system by north american standards though, so i can't complain too much.
on saturday, i saw an older woman give two highschool girls heck for not giving up their seats to an elderly man. they were in the priority seating section. i mentally applauded the elderly woman for speaking up.
from the 5-6 transit systems i've experienced myself, i can agree with what you've compared.
whenever i visit toronto and take the ttc i am surprised by how kind everyone is it makes me feel like crying, lol. well maybe a bit of an overreaction but wow, it really makes a difference in your everyday.
are you trolling?? dude, you should try the paris metro... you're going to love montreal public transit after that. at least here people don't shit and piss in the trains. personnally i think we have one of the best subways in the world.
yes you are 100% correct, those were the biggest reasons i started taking the commuter train instead, and it is so much better.
montrealers learn to be oblivious to each other. 
phones are partly to blame, but my impression is that there is no single montreal. everyone is so different that it's hard to establish how you are supposed to behave. social norms are almost a matter of personal style, so we become blind to them. people assume they can act however they wish. disapprobation tends to be expressed silently, but since we're all alone in public, the rude go on their own ways.
there are civic rules, but all you need to do is ignore them in order to get away with them.
never noticed the seat thing but i have to say that the montreal subway trains and busses are extremely (if not freakishly) clean.  does bombardier just give you new ones every year?  i was amazed.
ummm what?
the rocket is the specific type of train on line 1 of the ttc subway, it is the least dysfunctional part of the system.
the bart is more of an s-bahn type system with 4 downtown stations and 1/3 the volume despite much more track, making it more comparable with the new rem being built. 
the underground: what kind of time were you using it where there were seats to give up?
tokyo: there are entire treatises on subway etiquette.
montréal is nowhere close to being the worst. in fact i think it has one of the better high-volume, truly rapid transit systems around.
i am currently pregnant. obviously pregnant. can confirm that people are total assholes and do not offer me their seats on the metro.
it's worse in paris
having had a pregnant wife twice, i can attest that transit users are getting worse in this regard.
i get it, we all had a hard day but fuck you, give her your seat.
even worse, you try to give your seat to an elderly person or pregnant person and some other jackass tries to take it and makes a scene.
it doesn't happen often but it leaves a lasting impression when it does.
well my one point of comparison is the nyc metro system and toronto and i think we’re better than that, can’t tell you about tokyo or something tho cause i’m broke and take the metro for a reason lol
to be fair, i lived three years in shanghai and montrealers seem polite in the subway compared to mainland chinese…
as someone who voted coderre in the last two elections, and who was not too sure about plante's candidacy 4 years ago (even if i had nothing against his program a priori), well i'm going vote for her this time, no hesitation.
pu able to coderre. it just might have related, and i don't even know what he's supposed to do anymore. i don't even think he knows it himself.
4 years ago, plante had no experience, that's what made me doubt. but there she has it, and frankly, even if her mandate was not perfect, it was good enough to renew her.
honestly, i'm not crazy about a lot of things she's done but she seems to be competent and i also remember how bad it was under coderre. at least when she spends money, we are getting useful things that improve the city.
*"because she's not coderre."*  saved everyone five minutes.
the author of the article is on point about plante's accomplishments and the many challenges she was up against. and the fact there wasn't any corruption scandal during her tenure is a big plus.
definitely, i'm voting for projet montreal and valerie's team.
i hope denis coderre stays out of politics for good after his defeat.
best part:
>while coderre has always boasted about flashy projects that were supposed to “put montreal on the map,” plante, in fact, did just that — but in her own way. urban landscapers and environmentalists around the world point to our city as an example of so many things being done right. montreal has never been more of a joy to walk and bike in, to sit in a park, on a terrasse, or by the waterfront. as far as i’m concerned, that matters — not only for ecological reasons but for the sheer joy of urban living.
when denis coderre took office, the bar was very, very low. basically, if he managed not to be corrupt, people would be happy ... but after 4 years, i think montrealers realized that it was not enough, especially after all the fiascos that they made us endure (formula e, electric vls, etc.).
it's all the more funny because now he refuses to publish his sources of income "before being elected". so what little he could offer (ethics) he lost.
valérie plante is certainly not perfect, but at least she offers a progressive vision of the city.
last year, i almost ran over some cyclists head when he, out of nowhere, swerved and fell face down on the road. gotta say, almost decapitating someone at 5:45 am kinda messes up your day. thats why i want more bike lanes, so that they aren't in the way of 1500 lbs+ metal deathmachines.
by pulling a "trump", coderre proves why he does not deserve our vote.
**he literally said that he would release his tax returns only if he gets elected...** 
[
coderre is a con man!
already voted! stressful time to be a montrealer
[deleted]
people dunk on coderre here all the time, but i don't hear about any reasons for disliking plante. yes she's better than coderre, but why do people dislike her?
i appreciate the open conversation taking place here
coderre is such a sleaze ball. i hope valerie plante wins.
this is kind of a no-brainer
my question is more about sue montgomery - did plante completely screw up their relationship or is montgomery a power hungry maniac? or both? i basically want projet to have another term and continue to make montreal change, but i also want to send the message that valerie and friends have got to learn politics better and end the public embarrassments and self inflicted wounds. i'm wondering whether to split my vote ie one for plante and one for montgomery.
i will never vote for this woman! because i live in quebec. i love montreal and have no plans to move there in the short term. but let's say ... quickly, i would certainly vote against denis coderre.
anyone but that corrupt gangster coderre.
i would have probably skipped my vote if coderre did not show up. she got my vote already nonetheless, because i still recognize the sleazy arrogant coderre, who’s still the same aside of his lighter weight
only 2 real options, 2 candidate pockets. it feels like the usa.
i suggest everyone to familiarize themselves with the alternative in order to make a fully educated decision.
do mafia donations show up on tax forms?
denis "trump" coderre.
“denis spent a lot of time saying that he had changed, but in fact, we see the same scenario as in 2017. in 2017, denis coderre was hiding the number of tickets sold for formula e and in 2021, denis coderre hides his income, ”says the outgoing mayor of montreal, valérie plante.
during the last election, denis coderre had lost a lot of points among montrealers with formula e because of the many street closures, but also because the real number of tickets had been hidden for a long time. valérie plante believes that citizens will think about it on voting day.
"all the candidates do it and it is a matter of transparency," said the mayor.

i have a 2016 deja vu.
he probably senses he’s going to lose so why bother?
ah the spectre of formula e still hangs over him. the media needs to let it go already
said wu tang in a pouch 😆
nope. let the scum be accountable.
never going to let that go. guy had no right running a city
it was just a bad idea but would have worked if not held in that part of town.
sorry bud but as a tax owner, i'm still paying for it. not acceptable
and i’m not? i enjoyed the event it was just poorly organised…. that summer was overload with endless events though, with evenko… worst part is holding it in that area of town. the f1 track could have been made to work with the fe cars of the era or even techno park area. any populated area was going to be a shitstorm. the fact it was done with zero to minimal consultation goes to show you who denis really cared about that
slap a cop that looks in shape then take off. voila running partner.
hahah i would be happy to be your running partner, but i'm clearly faaar from your level.
you could check some montreal running groups on facebook, they're pretty active.
do you run early mornings ?
hey! feel free to dm me, i don't mind running with someone slower at all! i did post in a few running in montreal groups on fb but didn't get any luck yet.
yes!
same here. i prefer early morning runs. feel free to drop in my dm. i love running le plateau, le mont-royal and rue des carrières.

you can pay a dime at the land register to find out how the landlord paid. then multiple that by the hpi (house price index of 2021 / that of the year of its purchase)
quick way to bet if the offered price is consistent
look at comparables around on both duproprio and centris.
but in the end, it really comes down to knowing if you are comfortable offering what you are going to offer, if you have the means to pay for it and if there are no hidden problems or not that will put you in. tuesday ...
even if the seller asks for $ 50,000 / $ 100,000 +++ than what you appraise, what will change? you will not be able to negotiate lower than the asking price because there is always a zozo who will agree to pay and even pay a lot more than the asking price ...
what i can advise you at 200% is under no circumstances to skip the inspection, require a pyrite test and not accept a sale without legal warranty… it is a risk that is worthwhile under any circumstances.
happy shopping.
ps: an agent is useless, there is just going to put the pressure on you to buy you, less there is to visit to have your baby more ye happy, there is nothing to squeal if you pay $ 150,000 moreover, especially that on this over, it puts $ 4000 in the pockets ...
buy the property profile on jlr for $ 20. you will have access to a lot of information on the property (like all owners etc) and you will have a comparable generator that gives you a good report with the houses recently sold in a certain radius around and their price.
it's quite a bit of information available on the land register for $ 1 per consultation, but it's so much easier to have it all on one page.
i bought like that in 2018. after research all the “protections” come from the notary and not from the broker. with 1-3 hours of researching what should be in an offer to purchase (and the legal obligation to buy if accepted) you will know enough. for the price it is true that the broker would have given you his appreciation but an appreciation biased by his interest $ in carrying out the transaction quickly and by the market state favorable to the seller.
i had met the notary before making the offer to purchase and he took out the amounts for the sale of the 3 units of the triplex in undivided co-ownership, the mortgages of each and the co-ownership contract ... by only charging me the price of basis for the transaction made at home then.
the property value appears on the declaration.
market value is what someone is willing to pay.
look at comparables on centris and duproprio
one useful barometer is the municipal tax valuation. the sale price for most houses is going to be higher, but the degree to which it is higher depends on the market and the neighborhood.
i just bought my first house and we got it for 40% more than municipal, and there was a bidding war.
i based my own offer on muncipal + x% based on asking prices in the area. it worked.
if you like it and not many for sale in that area just make an offer. use the municipal evaluation and go from there. it’s not very difficult with dupropio
i don’t blame the owner for not wanting to use an agent, i’d do the same
so you could do whatever people say here or you could do the actual thing you're looking for and just [search for the property's taxes](
consequently, this is also the very first result for "evaluation fonciere montreal" so maybe think a little more next time you want to ask a question
i did this and using this method the price is slightly high but i don't know how to assess that they are selling it without legal warranty or the financial statements of the condominium. in addition, the seller does not seem in a hurry to sell, the house is on the market for more than a month already.
i prefer to avoid brokers because they have a perverse incentive to make buyers pay more.
i did not know jlr, i will try this, thanks.
i already have the land register info but the last transaction dates from 2017 so the price has increased a lot.
indeed notaries are the real professionals of real estate transactions.
a real estate broker is a furniture / tank seller who instead sells houses.
there isn't much these days so hard to compare.
your whole comment basically explains how the municipal evaluation is not a useful barometer.
except that these days the property valuation doesn't mean much, everything is selling pretty much above.
the municipal assessment is worth nothing insofar as if the owner does renovations without a permit, it does not appear on the assessment. my duplex is rated at just under 300k and is located near downtown montreal. i could easily sell it for 800k. so, the assessment is irrelevant. it is case by case and it varies from one district to another or from one city to another. you really have to see the comparables of the prices of houses sold and not the municipal assessment which ultimately only serves to extract taxes ...
as / u / _dismal_scientist mentioned, there is a huge conflict of interest in the broker system. the fact that the price you pay directly impacts their commissions, they have no interest in you paying less, nor that you make a good purchase.
it should be a fixed fee, the help of a broker should cost x to sell, x to buy and that's it. but it will never be like that, so i encourage you to continue never to deal with one or any of these parasites.
there’s a variety of conflicts of interest inherent with the system of realtors.

“grubby” ??? that’s got to be fake.
anyone here thinks it's crazy that 1. he did this for 11 years and 2. he only got 144k, for 12 kids, for that many years? 
that's a little more than 1000 per kid per year ... was it really worth it to fake that many kids? also, are there people who have that many kids who can testify that this is the amount? seems low
anyone here that got 10kids?
official press release: 
back in the day, you'd get a free loom after dropping your 12th sprog.
maybe he just really, really wanted a loom.
how about greedy
he probably didn't start with 12 kids right away, but added 1 per year. the benefits might get smaller every time?
i have a friend with 8 . real ones too.
i got more, probably lost in the sewers somewhere
montreal scanned the whole city in aerial lidar in 2015. you can extract the buildings in point clouds then convert:
you might be able to extract the 3d models from this x-plane montreal vfr scenario:

wow that's so cool thank you! with that and the link the other guy posted i think i can start thanks for the answer!
cool.

how to extract in point clouds?
awesome thanks!!!!
it's still work, it comes in a 1km square tile and everything that is in the shade of another building will be missing. but i had made beautiful renderings of the olympic stadium and a few other places.
it's lidar data ...

yeah, should have a big zip with it all.
yeah that's it, i don't know what software to use to open this type of file.

piece of shit.
it's fun.
other than playoffs; leafs/habs in montreal on a saturday night is what hockey’s all about.
i think that the name club de foot montreal looses something in translation.
sounds like a podiatrist club.
the expos are dead, but the best rivalry has always been with quebec.
the rivalry between mtl fc and toronto is synthetic. actually pretty vanilla…. it’s just done for usual montreal toronto tiff but in reality the two clubs are far from being rivals.
expos and bluejays couldn’t be rivals as they didn’t play in the same leagues…
given that [the team president who oversaw the rebranding was just fired]( the *foot club™* name will hopefully be short-lived.
what does it loose? their shoes?
the mls is as synthetic as the grass they play on. realistically we cannot have a sports rivalry comparable to hockey or european soccer. 
the idea is that by nature of the relationship with these cities the rivalry will be culturally imposed as it is clear that this is what the marketing teams have strategized; to foster a cultural involvement within the sport to increase engagement with their sports brand.
which is why i say, it's as synthetic as their grass because most of their grass is actually half synethic and half real grass
> most of their grass is actually half synethic and half real grass
what does this even mean? are you talking about the 5/27 stadiums with fully artificial fields, or the 2/27 with the same hybrid grass as anfield, old trafford, wembley, etc.?
mls is on par with league one on a very good day. i’ve turned down match tickets as i cannot stand montreal fc, saputo montreal fc or whatever they are called. i find there is zero excitement or atmosphere. it feels so fake that i simply can’t get into it. i’ve tried.
but sitting around believing that there is an actual rivalry between the two clubs is laughable. it’s all marketing fluff. those “ultras” trying to be a firm is just as laughable
the 100,000 people who attended the eastern conference final between the impact and tfc would probably all disagree with you on every point. 
you don't have to like it, but you can't pretend that the rivalry is all fake marketing bluster when there have now been dozens of hard-fought games between the teams over the last decade.
[deleted]
cool. enjoy watching soccer on tv then.
>those “ultras” trying to be a firm is just as laughable
it is true that to be taken seriously you have to make nazi signs or stab fans of opposing clubs.
most people just want to be part of the “experience “
impact supporters are starting to remind me of spurs. haven’t won shit but act as if they’re gods
like nearly all supporters ? cool.. i will! and it will be for a club i actually care about
coderre do you realize that he wants to become mayor and not provincial deputy? is he really that stupid?
his campaign is dla marde so he starts throwing dla marde on french like holness. sign of a losing campaign

*out, coderre, get the f\*ck out.*

coderre blah, jmen crazy a bit. holness doesn't stand a chance.
i look at the comments, it feels like air quebec. too much shame.
is it too much to claim moral damages for discrimination? is the * quebec charter * for everything except racism? money doesn't solve problems, so nothing should be done?
legally, when your rights are violated and you demand justice, what do you get? time travel to rectify the situation before it happens?
edit: what is even more shocking is that instead of the comments being “what !? designated places for black employees and others for white employees !? it's more of 1950, i think! ! ", the comments are of the money type (money settles nothing, who will receive the money ?, who will pay ?, etc.). it is completely astounding.
[deleted]
boomer business owners like me take notes.
what are "repairs"? seems to me that the term is often used, but hardly ever clearly defined.
systemic racism is a bit of a stretch. if there is racism, we have laws and courts to deal with it.
it is not very concrete …… give us examples of what happened concretely… .. put your finger on one or more culprits that they get ……
or
ask for ca $ h. it will surely help.
so according to them to soften the situation it is enough to pay tariff-racism ...
> the people who carried out the racism will not have to pay anything. the money is citizens' taxes, so the only consequence is the reduction in services in the already underfunded borough.
it is in no way shocking, but sad. a big lack of empathy and it is often during subjects like this that suddenly everyone is mr. madam truth detective. good thing irl people have more common sense than comments here.
my problem is that the repairs in question will come out of my taxes: they can ask for millions but those who are at the origin of the problem must pay part of it.
yeah, it makes me wonder why still in the 21st century we're dealing with racists
it is a legal term:
> in jurisprudence, reparation is replenishment of a previously inflicted loss by the criminal to the victim. monetary restitution is a common form of reparation. 
not sure what the french-speaking verbatim equivalence is, but it is true that it is not said very well since we use the term for something else - it is less frequent in english.
money
a big check.
you had to click on the link in the article. here it is: 
here is a relevant excerpt from the article:
> last may, investigation reports on systemic racism in employment in the borough, produced separately by the city and by the syndicat des cols bleue regroupés de montréal, indicated that racism in the workplace was common in the montreal-north.
> 
> reports showed collusion among union representatives as well as managers - who are predominantly white - to favor certain employees to the detriment of others of various ethnic origins.
in the original article, the expression "last may" contains the following hyperlink:  here is a relevant excerpt:
> the document also refers to comments, insults and direct manifestations of racism in the workplace. there is also discrimination in the allocation of tasks, vehicles without air conditioning and equipment.
> 
> there is favoritism in the granting of overtime and in the practices of transferring certain employees to sections without seasonal layoffs, adds the report.
> 
> professor saba also notes the presence of ethnic clans in the workforce and even designated places in a cafeteria for black workers, and others for whites.
> another report commissioned from professor angelo soares of uqam (new window) by the montreal blue collar grouped union states more or less the same problems.
and there again, "another report commissioned from professor angelo soares, from uqam (new window)" contains the following hyperlink:  /racism-final-report1470-1.pdf
it's a beautiful 49-page report.
well they'd take being un-abused first but unless you have a time machine, yeah, compensation will compensate. that's how justice works, you know? what do you think people who get raped get after putting their abusers behind bars? un-raped? you think motherfuckers get un-murdered? think a little before you speak
you are so many bad times 😂😂😂
if a city employee floods the basement with dozens of homes through gross negligence, it makes sense to me that the city pays for the repairs.
if a police officer kills someone through gross negligence, it seems normal to me that the spvm pay something to the family.
beyond "punishing" so that it does not happen again, the first goal is precisely to repair, even if "it will reduce services."
they pay no tax? we agree that even blacks in quebec society who are not blue collar workers from montreal north will also pay for that.
if paying tax because of racists is a problem, the solution should not be not to prosecute the employer of racists who let a situation of discrimination go on as normal. the solution is a change as a society whereby these behaviors are immediately punished with stigma. we are punished once monetarily and the next time it happens, more of us will be shouting "hey! stop it right now, i won't pay for this bullshit again!"
edit: the punitive damages won't be particularly high anyway, it won't amount to much out of a budget or out of a taxpayer's pockets. for example, [$ 6,000 for making racist remarks towards a person of haitian origin] ( man-will-have-to-pay-6000-for-having-made-racist-remarks.php).
several stories have been told about this. it is generally said to be due to freeze / thaw but this is not entirely true. generally, they are not built as they should be from the start since we do not put in as much material as we should. apparently, if we ask to be eight inches thick, we will put four and so on. they say it's often controlled by the mafia but who knows the truth?
it's always funny how cities outside of quebec with the same climate end up having such beautiful roads in comparison.
my biggest dream would be that we bring a team from elsewhere (vermont, scandinavian country or other) to pave just a small test road, and see how this road ages better than the others nearby. we do it in secret and we announce it five years later of course, question that no one sabotages the road in the meantime
c o r r u p t i o n .
> the municipality is not responsible for the damage caused by the presence of an object on the roadway or on a pedestrian or bicycle path.
>  
> ** it is also not responsible for damage caused by the condition of the roadway or the cycle lane to the tires or the suspension system of a vehicle **
in quebec, cities have legal immunity.
roads here are built to the lowest bidder vs best quality. to be fair it’s a combination of admin and builder. it gets blame on the weather all the time but go to vermont or maine or northern ny and they’re flawless.
does anyone know if they have the same problems in the nordic countries? do they build their roads like we do here or have we just developed bad habits?
also go to vermont, the climate does not change but the state of the roads changes dramatically
exact. northeastern united states, ontario: same climate (sometimes worse depending on humidity and elevation) but better roads.
beyond corruption, the report suggests above all that the only solution is a collosal reinvestment to get back to the streets on the right foot + reduce the size of trucks.
however, for trucks, there are surely possibilities but for roads, no one is going to offer that. the citizens would be well in tabarnak of the 10,000 construction sites of + and the cuts / debts necessary to pay for everything.
it's not always the lowest bidder though as the city review how feasible he can do it so often it goes to the second one.
the first bidder in this case is the one who settle the price and the other follows.
another thing it's the city who is the blame mostly as they give contract for redoing only the surface instead of going deeper.
the borough although is the one give's the contract at 90% but they go often with what the needs are compared to the city who don't have have a clue and order a work that is not the correct one for the street. just like snow removal.
prr, pcpr, prcpr are the different type of work the street and listed below.
prr: road repair program
pcpr: complementary planing-coating program
prcpr: pavement rehabilitation program by leveling-coating
no, it's pretty obvious when you go to our neighboring states and provinces. the temperature does not change drastically at the quebec border while the state of the roads, yes
i've driven in scandinavia. and i can say no, they do not have the same problems.
> it is also possible to apply the usual opening hours, but the sale of alcohol must cease at 1 a.m. and establishments must close at 2 a.m.

the cultmtl article said more. essentially this article is a comment on how in every other major canadian city you get to choose between the nutjob "businessman" who will tear up your bike lane and a centrist who will spend their term creating one bike lane as a pilot project.
who would have believed it, after the montreal of gérald tremblay and applebaum…!
lol. the grass is always greener in the neighbor ...
and neither of them will do any meaningful change, because the city is actually run by public servants.

pay employees more? offer a schedule 4 days a week? more vacations or more benefits?
no, employers prefer to waste their money on advertising, as if it will change people's priorities.
nah, only reason i will go back downtown is my work forces me and the moment they try is when i will be starting to search for a new remote job. 
work from home is the best, and no one is going to change my mind.
why wouldn't he put this money into re-imagining the roles and role model of the city center instead?
rather than being a bundle of offices and businesses to serve these offices, why not become a commercial, tourism, and / or leisure district?
the city center is already a place of attraction for tourists and commerce, why not revitalize in this direction?
why not transform some offices into cooperative artists' workshops?
i'm sure there must be at least a hundred better ideas than just going back to what it was before. before is in the past, maybe we could start planning for maintenent and après.
lol no thank you. it's either traffic jam and no parking spot or smelly metro/bus ride filled with sweaty people.. i prefer staying out of montréal as much as possible.
go to a stinky disneyland that has been deliberately transformed for the benefit of yuppies and tourists and do it at my own financial and time expenditure?
lol no thanks.
i imagine that the slam will convince a lot of people.
they don't need to be fancy. in the latest downtown state survey, full-time teleworking as a model was a big 2% of employers' intentions for the future. no obligation: 9%. the vast majority of people will come back to buy their little sandwich in the foodcourt under the tower from time to time.
the world will come back when the restrictions lift and employers apply their choices.
until then, it's a bit of wasted time and money.
lol fuck that.
will never go back to that city to work. traffic, bikes, montreal is not inviting.
it's not the office employers pushing for these ads. it's the downtown real estate and service businesses. restaurants, shopping centers, office tower owners ...
x2. i imagine i could have shit in a public restroom and put on deodorant in the morning.
without offices you have a lot of managers, managers and hr managers who will find ways to justify their useless job. this is why there is an anti-teleworking push.
worse if you have the misfortune to go outside at noon you are priced in a big cloud of cigarette smoke and pot, in the din of two construction sites, to be harassed for change or petitions.
what is new is that employees have a choice now. those who want to go back will go back, but me, never again.
the slam reminds me of this ...
[
employers say 9%, workers 62%. we are going to find out who has the big end of the stick among office workers!
but once those employers start losing workers to companies that do offer wfh on one hand and face lease renewals on the other, % of employers willing to offer it will change.
it is the chamber of commerce.
hahahahahahahahahah my digestive system is so much better since i have more to hold back ☺️
so shareholders should be happy to pay less people ?!
exactly! there aren't many qualities of life in montreal for people from the outside. the city is fun for an evening, but there is no advantage to working there.
is it me or does it often continue in this party?
is it because it is often extremists who often forget that politics is the art of compromise?
you know she switched to coderre to finally get kicked out again because she is anti-vaxx?
reading daniel sanger's book (saving the city) really helps to get a bit of perspective on what you're talking about.
tldr there is always a tension between a party of militants and once in power…. it's normal
it's still her and sue who continue, then croteau and ferrandez who slammed the door.
i'm not that old but i find that a lot, they often seem to say the same thing. and were themselves often stuck.
maybe it's a bad impression ...
very interesting, thank you.
[ferrandez to 98.5 on it] ( -positive-can-it-happen? fbclid = iwar2xiat4yrv3q_↓czt9qbymf5mxax26mjsgarosingpcnv5uvf3l06ybw)
ferrandez who slammed the door because pm wasn't stirring things enough to his liking. it's not a strong argument to support your point.
provost is an anti-vaxx angry at having been doubly tamped with, montgomery was suspended 120 days (suspended) by the upper court for his actions. so they are more the problem in this case. however, we can see that project montreal have chosen the applications a bit hastily in 2017 (in their own words), which is different in 2021.
for croteau, he started on his own. in his case, from what i understood was that the people at pm asked him if he was ready to campaign, door-to-door, etc. worse, he wasn't so tempted so he was offered to give up his place to someone more motivated (he had been there for a while).
ferrandez, as another put it, was in the position of the "extremist" who finds that things are not moving enough. worse in the media, he remains clearly pro-plante.
if we take the history of all the mayors of montreal, you have people slamming the door square inch through all the parties, if you check even more deeply towards the provincial parties, it's cubed. jean drapeau crowned the world outside quite easily, thank you in his time.
the world is going through times of tension and change, a pandemic election ticks a lot of the ticks, and with the 24/7 news cycle, that's multiplied by 1000.
i guarantee these are impressions, now the reasons people leave are more indicative of problems than the fact that people leave
croteau didn't slam the door, he wanted more time for his family. big difference!
that it seems to be a party full of people who seem like extremists and stupid?
i am not in the party. i do not know. that's why i asked the question.
are there perhaps too many chosen ones?
there are twice as many elected to say the quadruple in the countries of northern europe / capita
and it seems to be going well for them
and in toronto more than 1/2 less. worse it seems to be going well too.
difficult to say without knowing what they are basing themselves on. perhaps the reduced ability of people to take a possible rate hike? are taxes generally higher in montreal?
let me tell you my ndg housing/pricing story:
i live in central ndg. it's mostly 1950s construction and not terribly attractive. the prices are around 10-20% lower than the "hot" monkland village area of ndg.
in 2005, a 4-plex (two duplexes attached together) sold in my area for $600,000. this was an incredible amount of money to me at the time. i couldn't believe that anyone had that type of money and i wondered how the buyer could make a profit on it. at that time you could still buy a duplex in ndg for under $300k. the developer who made the purchase ended up spending around a year and a half fixing up the building. he changed it from oil heating to electricity, put in all new windows, fixed the bricks, new kitchens in each of the four units, a new roof, etc. he must have spent at least $150,000 on the renovations plus he was paying property taxes to the city the whole time. he ended up selling each one of the units for $250,000 - $300,000. i guess he made around $300,000 profit in the end. a couple months ago one of the four units in the building sold for **$725,000!** in other words, each of the four units now has a market value which is above the selling price of the entire building around fifteen years ago. this is insanity and it can't continue.
bogus. never going to happen… mtl always have been undervalued.
the kind of news that creates a pool of liquidity, and enough buyers ready to enter the market and cushion the correction.
in short, sideways, but not down.
even with a correction that would bring it to pre-pandemic levels, those prices were still high. but i suppose it's true that real estate has never depreciated in the long term...
i wish! i'm not paying 1.5 million for a closet in ndg.
with overbids of + 50% vs. the displayed price and lineups of 60 visits for a free visit on the weekend of the sale, big doubt. maybe for the cottage market if travel picks up more and more.
remindme! 1year
not gonna happen
there is the report: [ media / article / 2021/10-canada-housing-market-outlook.pdf).
> sales in ottawa, toronto and montreal have fallen significantly over the past few months amid low inventories and are now closer to pre-covid-19 levels.
> by september, only regina fit that category, while year-over-year house price growth has been weaker in vancouver, montréal and hamilton.
> house prices in montréal have also shown greater sensitivity to overvaluation in the historical data since 2005, so they will likely experience more downward price pressure compared with toronto or vancouver.
so, they think the montreal market historically is more vulnerable to negative and overvalued pressures (i think because of easier builds that release the overvaluation), and since now we will have pressure exactly for 1-2 years (most to 2022). ).
this is not something shocking, the markets can go down at times, even with long time ascents… just shocking to canadians, probably.
the same guys who graded trash mbss as aaa?
moody’s the guys that were caught red handed giving false ratings that contributed to the 2008 crisis. and the execs were never prosecuted?
this same moody’s?
these guys serve their customers - the banks. everyone else take their reports with grain of salt (or heaping spoonful).
dreaming is free
that would still make most people who bought pre pandemic way above what they paid their house for if you consider the 20-25% appreciation in prices since covid started.
it will only happen if the bank of canada actually raise the rates. it's overdue and we can't continue with 4-5% inflation every month...
no one will sell for a loss, that much is obvious
the same moody’s that was rating dogshit bundles of subprime cdos and mbss as aaa back in 2008? lol. fuck off moody’s. you print ratings and guidance for whoever wants to pay.
i'd put money down that they are wrong.
i think the prices will probably keep rising in the long term as long as the separatists stay out of power. whenever that or language laws become more prominent more people move away and prices drop. it's one reason why montreal is so cheap compared to toronto.
my realtor told me this too.  he said the market is showing signs of cooling and if you want to sell in the next couple of years, it’s best to do it asap.  glad i listened.
a condominium is taxed on the whole and not just on a unit. no chance that the bylaw makes sense for all undivided co-ownerships
many people will suffer and not just the richest since property values have increased significantly over the past few years.
what will the elderly who have bought their house for a long time do to them?
you should also consider the income of the owners as well, not just the value of the property.
i missed some info where does this rule make much sense?
this promise depends on the government of quebec. indeed, it cannot modify the levels of taxation without modifying the law on municipal taxation, which is in the provincial register. it's funny that she makes a promise without specifying this rather important detail.
result: less expensive properties will go up in price faster, more expensive ones will go up a little less quickly, accessibility to property deteriorates.
> what will the elderly who have bought their house for a long time do to them?
ok, i hear this argument a lot, and it just doesn't hold water. the person, old or not, who has seen the value of his house go from 50k to 800k, capital-tax-free, he has the means to pay an increase in property tax until the end of his life with a reverse- mortgage or a heloc, and he will be left with a lot of it, especially as the house continues to rise in value.
of all the people in the country, those who bought a long time ago are in the best position. there is never anyone who has lost their house because it has gone up in value.
i would like to understand how you arrive at this reasoning?
it all really depends on your income and people don't lose their house, they end up selling it and buying it smaller.
reverse-morgage is the worst deal you can do. it benefits precisely the elderly people who absolutely want to stay in their house. at this stage they are better off selling.
certainly.
taxes have a direct impact on purchase prices. to determine their maximum purchase price, people look at how much they can pay per month, mortgage + tax + insurance + condo fees + heating, etc.
if any of these factors go up, the mortgage budget goes down and people bid for less. if any of these factors go down, people bid more. this is a well-known effect, google it.
lowering taxes raises prices, raising taxes lowers prices. in the end ~~ you ~~ new buyers pay the same per month, but if the taxes are higher, the down payment required is lower.
coming back to our story, if “entry-level” homes and condos have a tax cut, their price will tend to go up. if "luxury" homes have higher taxes, their prices will go down. in the end it will have the effect of reducing the price range.
this is one way to take advantage of the capital in your house without selling it. this is precisely why mortgage loans were invented: to be able to release the capital frozen in buildings.
the-old-people-who-bought-their-house-for-a-long time, they are rich today, unless they have burnt everything down. and they keep getting richer as prices go up.
while that sounds fine, my city has reduced municipal taxes for years.. prices have not ever increased beyond neighbouring cities with flat tax rates. it fact, it lags its closest neighbouring suburb..
a drop in supply (new builds) and a rise in interest rates is what will move the needle on real estate prices. this imposes real material financial limits for buyers.
the items you mentioned won’t have much of an impact at all. follow literally any city that lowers (or increases) its municipal tax rate and look at historical sales. 
i don’t think you will find any data that correlates..
reverse mortgages are exorbitant loans. you will pay various fees and closing costs that will total thousands of dollars in addition to paying a mortgage loan insurance premium.
a reverse mortgage is hardly ever a good idea. an important distinction between a regular mortgage and a reverse mortgage: when you make payments on a regular mortgage each month, you pay off the interest and principal, which reduces the amount you owe. because you never pay off your reverse mortgage, the number accumulates month after month.
a regular mortgage is made up of a lower amount each month. a reverse mortgage consists of a higher number.
if you die, your estate pays off the loan with the proceeds from the sale of your home. if one of your heirs wants to live in the house (even if they already do), they will have to find the money to pay off the reverse mortgage; otherwise, they have to sell the house.
the other trigger for the repayment is that you leave the house. once you do, you have one year to close the loan.
if you are moving to a retirement home and / or need special care you will likely need the equity in your home to pay for these costs. if you owe a lender a substantial portion of the equity in your home, there will not be much left for the nursing home.
in short, if you have reached this stage, it is better to sell your house and find a cheaper residence.
as i said it all really depends on the income of the person or of the retirement household. each case is unique and not everyone has good pension funds or has managed their money well for their retirement. for some, their savings are just their house. not long ago, quebec was the province whose households had the most debt (i don't know if this is still the case though).
>this imposes real material financial limits for buyers.
a half point tax hike has the same impact on the buyer's budget as the same interest rate hike, if the appraisal matches the purchase price. even more, given the down payment.
when is the last time that a municipal assessment = the purchase price?
it may depend on the city but municipal taxes aren’t based on the full municipal evaluation either (for my city).
my annual mortgage payments are about 7x higher than my municipal taxes. i assure you the increase in interest rate will hurt prospective buyers far more.
this is why, for the sake of comparison, we are talking about the * effective * rate of property tax, and not the rate applied to the assessment.
>my annual mortgage payments are about 7x higher than my municipal taxes.
let's start with the fact that your payments include the repayment of the capital ...

cool beans, how about your plans to restore tourism
thanks! i've been photographing street art for a little over a decade now, but only started to create a serious collection four years ago (1200+ photos at the time of writing). i'm out walking and on my bike a lot and so i tend to take quite a few photos every month and its always an adventure finding new art!
nikon d5600, 18mm nikkor, 1/40s, f/20. did you know that if you stop down your apeture to a tiny hole, all light sources appear as a starburst pattern? and the amount of "rays" that you see is proportional to the amount of blades that are there in your lens!
i've got a few more photos from around mt. royal here:
thanks you!  its really appreciate during those rainy days!!
beautiful.
great shot!
wow!!!
beautiful with all the colors!
yeah, i was thinking back to this day today when i saw darkness @ 7am today!
i'm sure it looked this way today(1 nov) as well!
oh yeah, seeing golden leaves illuminated during the golden hour is something else :)
coderre is never going to do this because we would be able to see **who** has been supporting him financially those past few years and we all know, **his supporters are rich assholes who only want coderre back so they can resume the grift on the back of the taxpayers.**
i don't particularly like plante, but i have to admit that it's still a slam dunk on denis that hahaha
coderre said if he's elected, he will reveal his earnings/taxes. hmm, where have i heard this before? and why does it feel like we'll regret voting for denis no matter what he says or does?
interesting facts. she had rental income of $ 31,020 in 2016 and $ 28,740 in 2020. so the rent on the unit she cut to convert her 5plex to a quadruplex was not very expensive. 🧐
coderre told tlmep that he was not revealing it because of nda / confidentiality and immediately after that he said that we will find out after his "victory". suddenly there will be more ndas? man, fuck that guy.
it's easy points and i'm glad she earns them.
check
hahaha
i'm very disappointed that ballarama doesn't want to be transparent: basic condition for me to vote in someone with such an important public responsibility. coderre was never an option. so, plante got my vote.
i respect that in criss
i voted for plante and all my friends are raging at me
viv le qebec lib tabarnak
it's click bait as the title because there is no number in the article.
i’m sure to get downvoted for this but, i just don’t think elected officials should have to release their tax forms unless it’s a specific rule (and i don’t think we should have a rule about it). people who are only *running* for office and are not yet elected and so do not owe us their private business like how much they earn from where and how much of it goes to taxes. there’s an argument to be made that people who are already elected are public servants and they work for us etc, but that could very easily lead to candidates having to release their forms so i think this just shouldn’t be something we expect of candidates or of incumbent elected officials.
the problem is that valérie plante seems more "clean" than coderre in terms of income and financing. however, it has a lot of problems with its promises of a bike path or a little fishy snow removal when other more important issues are at stake.
coderre seems to have a better vision of the problems to be solved, but is all wrong as an individual: /.
at the same time, it's rare that in politics you find a good player since they always give too many promises and you never know which ones will give up.
for example, at the federal level you vote liberal since they want to plant 1 billion trees to realize that after 4 years there is not always 1.
195 000 $ pr not do much c qd mm much too much ... entk
[removed]
even worse, he says "you'll know once i'm elected" which.. wtf dude i think he said the quiet part out loud
exactly.
the same. i'd rather have a few bike paths in the worst places imaginable than sell town jewelry in evenko.
rip best sign ever
i want that to be the name of the condo that takes it's place.
when my daughter was 5, she thought it was a barbie store and wanted to go in.
going to have to go to the ordinaire sex club now.
i gonna bet this was arson by one of our lovely montreal mafia members.
someone wanted to claim insurance?
was leaving scotia bank cinema while it was happening, the quantity of smoke was insane, was hard to breath even outside and down the street.  was surprised to see it was just 2 three story buildings.  and agree, was the best neon sign in the city even if i am not a fan of strip clubs, should be replaced!
my first strip club experience was there when i was 18. it was magical. rip.
how horny were the men in there, exactly?
honest question but what was the super sexe when it was opened? was it a strip club, a sex shop or something like cinema l'amour?
there is a surprise.
no f*ckin way!!!!
hope that the employees find decent work out there
aw man. club super sexe. the only time i went there, i only had 10 minutes, and i think i made a mistake; i picked the soup!
montreal should commission a larger replacement more garish than the original.  they could put it anywhere.  they could move it around.
rip to a montréal landmark
saw my first lesbian show there.
with two other dudes.
3:2 is an uncomfortable ratio.
😔
meeeeerde!
rip the roast beef buffet lunch 🤣
this has been around for a long time, we call it a "park"
everything but concrete
"thus, on places such as the land of the montreal school services center, we could find social housing, community gardens, a childcare center, parks and recreation areas or even businesses administered in the form of cooperatives. "
so co-ops of condos and services in co-op mode more than parks. common but local management.
how to say you haven't read the article without saying you haven't read it
welp, for once, i agree with the review of ensemble montreal
> “what the mayoress omits to say about a possible waterfront promenade on the banks of the st. lawrence river is that this project remains under federal jurisdiction. this project has been in the air for almost 10 years now. the city can be a partner, but it is the société des bridges that has the last word. this is another marketing stunt from projet montreal which is throwing out false promises, ”reacted denis coderre's press secretary, elizabeth lemay.
it is totally true. [i already came across an article in 2019 talking about the redevelopment.] ( this is something that was already planned. whether projet montéal is elected or not, it will happen.
the question would be how it can be integrated into the current urban fabric, and how we could enhance the site for active transportation.
ensemble montreal could promise the same thing, it is not the land of the city anyway. i will vote for projet montreal anyway, but it is indeed a somewhat opportunistic announcement.
unfortunately, this land remained difficult to access with the many railroads and the marshalling yard in the area.
everyone promises business ...!
thank you for the information!
> whether projet montéal is elected or not, it will happen.
yes and no.
in fact, yes the main project starts from the company of the bridges, but it is still relevant that the municipal political parties decide on how the whole will be "encircled" by the installations of the city.
but yes, there is a bit of political marketing in there. i think that said that coderre is especially annoyed not to have thought about it before.
it is accessible from both ends. there are already bike paths on riverside / pierre-dupuy street, then at the other end is the bike path that goes next to the monseigneur-richard school in verdun. from there you can go to the lachine canal or continue to lasalle (and lachine) by following the trail that already runs along the river, and which is very pretty.
it gives a way to bypass the lachine canal trail to get to the champlain bridge from the old port / vice-versa.
edit: there is even already a "ramp" / bike path junction that is being developed from the one that passes between the nuns' island bridge and the monseigneur-richard high school. i imagine that this is what would allow access from verdun and the champlain bridge. it would make a bicycle "highway" that runs alongside bonaventure. it actually offers nothing of great value between the two, but it allows an alternative to the existing cycling network. if it's plowed in winter in addition ... mmmm.
edit2: [if you want more info on the project.] (
exactly. the idea is great, but if the promenade is not easily accessible without a car, blah.
if i am elected, i promise to name stars after each individual who votes for me!
also, i promise a hyper loop from montreal to vancouver.
why would you want to get there a car? in addition, you can easily park a car near the entrance to the champlain bridge to access the future promenade. otherwise it is possible to park in the old town and rent bikes or go for a walk, as that's kind of the point.
what a crazy idea to want a corridor of nature and pack a highway but love it only if you can get there by car.
[quelle belle nature!](
this is exactly what i say
oh indeed my apologies, i read too quickly.
in short, look at the proposed plans, some streets will be moved and that will possibly make the area * a little * more accessible. but already the idea of a bicycle and pedestrian link between the champlain / verdun bridge and the old one is interesting even if there is not much between the two. then the distance between the two is not very great, barely a few km.
it has to be redone anyway so all the better if we can when we can restore access to the shore for a few km even if it is only accessible from the ends.
la petite voie du fleuve is only accessible by ste-catherine, the pier and parc jean-drapeau and yet it makes a pleasant place to explore and visit. it's not * so * difficult to access anyway.
edit: i just tried to understand the plan a bit.
a new street is proposed that crosses the railway at pointe-st-charles and would join the new development.
> a new track (rue a) is also proposed to link rue carrie-derick to the site of the former canadian national (cn) workshops, thus allowing direct access to this sector without using the local network. this link becomes the main road access to the center de foires, if it is located in the former cn workshops, and will allow pointe-saint-charles residents to access the future green network intended to replace the bonaventure expressway along the banks. .

so beautiful. one thing that is cool about montreal is how old buildings such as churches can add a lot to an otherwise relatively single height area of town.
awesome picture. that's my montreal.
i believe that's tier clock tower on laurier in outremont at the bottom too right?
beautiful

i can see my flat from there, such a nice picture. walking on saint-viateur when the sun sets is amazing.

i just moved into this neighborhood yesterday!  thanks for the beautiful picture!
where did you shoot this from?
had a friend recommend it to me after, installed it but haven't used it yet since i only use the metro for my commute
recommended!
yep it is
church of st michael and anthony on the left (google maps just calls it "polish church" lol) and saint édouard church on the right.
from the north-eastern lookout on mont royal
it has subway time prediction too
thanks - nice shot.
finally, crescent absent from douchebags
notice the absence of the orange color. it's calming.
where is this?
such a stark contrast of old and new, great perspective
pretty with the towers behind
one of the most beautiful photos here!
nice picture!
amanazing picture. thank you for sharing 😀
leonard!
but completely empty. it was at what time?
omg what's that mural?? who is it???? it's beautiful!
this is actually a great photo, not just for what it shows, but also for what it doesn’t; if you were to take the photo from literally 15 seconds away, on the corner of de maisonneuve and crescent, it’s not at all this nice. 
lately, it’s been a cesspool. 
the angle of this picture is clever because it hides that ugliness behind natural obstacles. very nice!
its very strange to see crescent this empty. i left montreal last year so i only saw a bit of the pandemic there, but i would have thought it'd be bustling again now with everything open.
it will have taken a pandemic.
downtown near concordia
2 p.m!
that’s montreal’s own, leonard cohen! 😊
and why is there a spock mural?
fuck,
i'm an old boomer and have worked downtown all my life. it saddens me deeply that downtown montreal is dying.
i always thought it was the heart of montreal. covid and the destruction of sainte-catherine will finish him off.
eh?? a mural there ?? i've never seen him, what are you talking about?
he had 45 in 2019 and 42 in 2020.
does it count the feminicides that there have been? yet another not long ago?
ok?
[deleted]
we will not make the playoffs at this rate!
id imagine that murders of women would be counted in the murder statistic.
ok
both are correct. your numbers are from the city of montreal, then the po numbers are from the cmm.
on statcan, but it's for the greater montreal area and not just the island. [source] (
interesting. considering that in total the cmm is more than double the population of the island, that means that the suburbs of montreal have pretty much the same crime rate as the island.
great shot!  looks like a hollywood still from the faculty ❤️
very cool ! where is it exactly ?
cool to see the paint wearing so well. i suppose a new condo building will be covering it up again soon?

so what exactly has coderre been doing for the last 4 years?? it says alot about the guy where after losing in 2017 he went off into the shadows to lick his wounds and did not involve himself in municipal politics at all (correct me if i'm wrong on that one) and suddenly sees an opportunity and voila! heeerrrrre's coderre!
my point here is that coderre is in it for himself and only him. as we've seen he'll say whatever to get votes. to compete with plante and project montreal he's suddenly very green, throwing out green projects that he knows are complete bullshit coming from him. i will vote on valerie plante and pm any day over coderre's corrupt style of politics.
the light that looks like a halo above his head is beautiful in the context.
yet he shouldn't be ashamed. being the little bitch of evenko, the molsons and the underworld is also a real job.
bribes look bad on a tax return ... / s
here's a red-flag
" ...denis coderre also founded his company in april 2018, a numbered company which, according to the register of companies, is a management and consulting company"
that tells you everything you need to know. first, it's a "numbered company". that means that instead of being called "coderre inc." or whatever, it's official name is something like "911095-2893 inc". you use that method when you don't want to be easily found or noticed.
second, it's a management and consulting company. consulting is politician talk for "i scratched your back by passing legislation beneficial to your company. now you scratch my back by paying me for "consultation"".
crapu
> balarama holness has refused to disclose its assets. i was a student and unemployed [with] very low income, he told us.
at the entrance to the tantot grocery store, there was a worker for balarama holness who gave out 4-color postcards saying to vote for holness and his team. it's unusual, to say the least, for a mayoral candidate to spend such sums of money in my little corner of montreal.
so, my little question: where does this money come from? the only one who wins if holness wins 10 or 15% of the votes: denis coderre. the votes for coderre are set in stone, they will not change. but the votes for valerie plante are changeable.
probably guy a lepage who told him to do that
why would the public want to know coderre's income? it's his personal income, it's none of your business
from what i see, radio-canada is on the last stretch of its campaign to have sister smile re-elected.
he was working at stingray. source: coworker
i wish i lived in mtl just to vote against that pos.
i liked coderre a few years ago. actually at the beginning of his mayor tenure. however the formula e fiasco, and the stupid cell phone while driving thing among other, just proved to me that this guy will never admit any responsability for anything. we know other people like that in the public space, and it never ends well...
thanks! i’m really having a hard time deciding who i dislike more vp or dc. you summed it up nicely…
coderre was councillor for two years for the fia, a lobbying group for the automobile industry run by the former ceo of ferrari.
the mayor of montreal, and being there little bitch from molson. name a more historic duo!
tax doesn't care, as long as you declare them so they can get their cut.
i am far from the idea of defending coderre, but the fact that a company chooses to keep its name by number has nothing to do with wanting to remain anonymous. denomination by number is even the "default" option when you incorporate a company.
information on the shareholding of a numbered company is still public. there are a thousand and one totally legal ways so that your name does not appear in the register (use of trusts, consolidate the shareholding in a foreign company which does not have to appear in the register, etc.) but the fact of using a numbered company is not an indicator of fraud or hiding. coderre registered his own name as a shareholder when it would have been easy and legal for him not to.
it just means he had to put his money somewhere. you notice denis coderre because it’s denis coderre. he doesn’t need the marketing of giving his company a name.
thank you for sharing!
excellent video as usual!
i can't wait to see the others since uqam is the only one where i had already set foot.
with the exception of wearing masks, the remaining restrictions in places where the vaccine passport is required are arbitrary and capricious. 
if masked, fully vaccinated people cannot gather to dance today, what is going to change between now and when they can, and when do we anticipate this medical miracle?
experts who say "we need to wait and watch" at this point should be aggressively pushed back on. "we need to wait until when? we need to watch for what?"
israel has all of its night clubs open and without masks.
at full capacity to see their videos.
why this ban in quebec? the risk is the same
so you never danced while pressing your body against your partner?....
do you plan to never press your body against anyone else for the next 5 years?
why can i press my body against random strangers on public transportation, in the bell center or other indoor stadiums, at the tam tam festival, in a gym, at the hockey rink, but not at a dance floor? 
this feels almost like something out of a religion, we can't allow xyz reasonable-sounding thing because from there it's just a hop, skip and a jump to adultery
>this feels almost like something out of a religion
nope, pressing your body against someone els is an expression you should learn. cheers!
"good deal!" * foundation cracks * "i want the government to pay for the repairs".
as a tax payer i am absolutely against using public funds to pay for this type of shit.
well yes .... because of climate change !! anything!!! potholes too, while you're there?!?
make sure you have some halloween lighting outdoors to attract the beasts. it's easier for kids to see that you're ready to give out candy. normally when you're out of candy you turn off those lights as a sign that you're all out.
let them ring the door and give it to them yourself by putting it in their personal loot containers.
it's perfectly fine to interact with the kids, ask them what their costume is if you don't know, compliment them if you find it particularly well made/funny/scary. 
you're evening will start around 17:00 with the very young children and go to around 21:00.
start slow, norm is 2 pieces of candy per child. increase the amount you give over time if you think you have enough, usually around 20:00.
if you have any left at the end, around that 21:00 time and you don't want to keep it for yourself, it's very important that you leave all of it out in a bowl. it's glorious for kids to find that bowl on their own.
and have fun!
here's what not to do: no handful of shelled peanuts, no pennies, no molasses candy, no apples, no toothbrushes, no raisins. when i trick or treated in the 80s, these weren't rare.
my rule when i was a kid and passed on to my daughter: house with no jack-o-lantern 🎃, means a house with no candy.
i also do 2 pieces per kid.  at the beginning you’re dropping candy into empty bags. don’t feel bad or compelled to give more. by 7pm you’ll have kids struggling to lift the bags because they’re so full. maybe drop down to 1 per kid if you’re running low
i always put out a sign so i don’t get visitors at 10 ~ 11pm (yes, some older kids are in it for the long haul)
quantity of candy to give: if you're one of those rich people that gives out full sized candy then one is enough. 
if you're handing out small format chocolates or candy bags then 2-3 per children.
if it's the individually wrapped candy then a small handful. 
you can leave a bowl out with candy if you don't want to answer the door for each kid, just don't leave it completely full (refill it every so often) because some dick will inevitably grab the whole thing for themselves.
we lived in a non-halloween celebrating country before we moved here also!  
i take our kids out (they were shocked at the prospect of people giving them candy the first year we went). my husband refuses to participate and so he hides in the basement with all the lights off and watches sports :d  as a result, our house doesn't give out candy, so i make up little baggies for the neighbour kids (there's only, maybe 8 of them) and i've delivered them already.   
in general, depending on where you live, there will either be a ton of kids or very few. you can tell what kind of neighbourhood you have by how many houses near you are decorated.  a lot of parents take their children to certain neighbourhoods because those neighbourhoods go all out for halloween.  
in any case, as others have said; if you want trick-or-treat kids leave your lights on and some sort of decoration to indicate you are "open"   
they will ring or knock and you can drop some candy in their bag.  the whole reason i take my kids out, is that it's a good way to meet people who live near me.
halloween is my favourite “holiday” i love giving back all the candy i took when i was a kid
there is 1 simple rule when you give in mtl, since it'll be dark very soon in the afternoon :  
outside lights on = you are a candy giver.  
outside lights off = you are not giving candy
anyone else used to have a couple houses in the neighbourhood that would hand out a can of pop?
my experience is that kids love the mini bags of chips or cheezies!
edit:  waiting until the last minute to buy halloween treats might see a reduction in variety available, but retailers have usually reduced the prices.
take the time to hand them out or just dont give them. bowls end up stoled in the first hour so. 1 to 2 candy is fine, a lot of people give more, but as a kid i would always end up with more than what was reasonable. don’t hide needless or free drugs and you should be fine.
keep a bowl by the front door. as for quantity, i suppose it depends on how busy it is. i  don't like running out. that being said, it usually turns into huge fistfuls by the end of the night because i've rationed too tightly lol.
my husband chases kids who ring our door with an ax and then they get a fun size snickers. its a good time. 
i usually have treats ready and pre portioned for quick distribution because having strange kids at my door makes me anxious.
yes, bowl near front door at the ready - maybe have some small change also for anyone collecting for charity
i usually give 2 mini chocolates per kid however i give 5-6 when inspired by the kids/costumes
interacting is at a minimum other than a quick happy halloween wishes or cool costume
as to the candy itself, individually wrapped is necessary.  most parents will sort though the candy and throw out anything that is not wrapped.  also best to avoid anything with peanuts.
decorations to let people know your your participating.  it certainly doesn’t need to be fancy
the candy is up to you, but 2-3 pieces a kid is plenty.
i’d suggest keeping a bowl by the door just to make things easier.
you can also just leave a bowl of candy out, and generally people aren’t greedy, only take a few pieces
it depends where you live, if you live in an extremly populated area then give 1 or 2 at max pieces to each kid, if it's in a farm town give a small handful. also keep your lights on, that's a sign that your giving out candy and stuff, when lights go off you either arent participating or your asleep (some religions dont participate some people just dont like to participate) people mainly put a bowl out when they're not home. enjoy
some people give one or two, some give a handful, some give little baggies and some will give nuts or grapes
lot of newcomers don't realize how pervasive the tricks can be.  if you're giving out bad candy the kids will trick you.  
you may find flaming bags of dog poo on your porch, don't step on the fire you're going to get poo on your shoes.
instead use the flames from the flaming bag of dog poop... to keep the little beasts at bay.  i suggest using a stick to pick up the bag of poo and using it as a torch.
i highly recommend getting a lacrosse stick, this will be used to catch eggs that are being thrown at your house... with proper training maybe in a couple years of halloween you'll be able to catch the egg without having it break into your face... this is peak candy giving mastery, catch the egg in the lacrosse basket and simply hurl it back at the nearest child.
make sure in the morning to check your engine under the hood, be sure that your brake line is not been clipped... 
the only way to ensure the children aren't going to play tricks on you during halloween is to give away good candy... we're talking full chocolate bars, toblerones, gumdrops, it's almost assuredly guaranteed that if you give away tootsie pops you're going to get tricked... nobody likes tootsie pops.  
you might think it's a good idea to give reese's peanut butter cups away but every once in awhile you'll have one of these neanderthal children that's allergic to peanuts and they're going to play a dandy trick on you.  we're talking catfishing in your wife, stealing your identity, bank fraud... stay away from peanut butter candies.
you might see one of these little rascals with a unicef box very important to give them full $100 bills or the tricks are coming.
^ this guy knows.
exactly that
also thanks for giving candies. i feel like halloween has been less and less popular in the last few years (even pre-pandemic)
bring your black or blue pen, or pencil!

let me be downvoted along with you: don't worry about him, there are plenty of car lovers in this city. they're just stuck in traffic instead of redditing.
coderre will make sure your kids can't afford a home here in 20 years. you can't make the argument that they are both meh with a straight face, it's not true. they have very different platforms and one of them is much better than the other.
> she is also hard on the eyes and is a woke social justice warrior that is useless
per usual, right-wing conservatism and misogyny going hand to hand.
hard on the eyes? that’s really one of your criticisms? looks like we spotted the incel
due to the covid measures, the supplied pencils are disposable and are then thrown away. to avoid waste, it is good to bring your own! also, the choice of pen is limited to blue or black, because any other color can be a distinctive sign allowing the voter to be identified.
coderre is openly corrupt and has a punchable jambon face.
or at least less bad
valérie plante won’t make housing more affordable. maybe if only by curbing the appeal of the city and making it an undesirable place to live in. 
coderre is also very capable of doing that all by himself too.

with a side order of antivax to complete the combo

> punchable ham face.
haaahahahahah! this is such a good term!
i think macroeconomics are above what she can control (the costs are exploding in every city in the world at the moment, read more newspapers).
but she is proposing a plan which i believe has a much better chance for success than "let the free market regulate itself", which is what coderre is basically saying. like, there's no debate, his catering to developers is dog shit for the city.
i'm so impatient to try the adirondack!
if i went to new york, the train would be a no brainer if you factor in all costs, but the fact it takes 10 hours is ridiculous.
i know this is amtrak and we have no control, but cut out most small towns on the route (i bet most riders are between mtl and ny anyway) and finish off whatever needs to be done for preclearance (which is both sides' problem).
my girlfriend visits family in boston fairly often and the 5-6h drive is usually 8h because of the border. if we want to make these modes more attractive than the car, we need to get these done!
your vote in the provincial election will be much more crucial for french in montreal than anything that happens in municipal politics.
> is there a difference between coderre and plante in their speeches and actions on the defense of french? does another candidate stand out at this level?
linguistic issues will mainly be managed in quebec city, and not at montreal city hall. no real leeway on which plante and coderre can act, as far as language is concerned. probably why they never really got involved on this subject during the campaign.
as for holness, he dreams in 14 technicolor dimensions if he thinks he has a chance to convince the government of quebec to change the status of the city to anything other than what it is right now. . he sells snake oil, most likely is well aware of it, and is good at it. exploiting the vote of the montreal-centric neopartitionists to advance their career prospects in politics - let's say there is a worse way to go.
as far as i'm concerned, municipal politics is more than a circus.
we owe plante and cathy wong the first plan in terms of promoting french in montreal.
in terms of the french, plante and coderre are not very different.
there were gardens, but holness devoured it all round so there you go.
plante is the only candidate with measures for the protection of the french in its platform. for this reason, she has my vote.
montreal is a bilingual or even trilingual city no matter how hard politicians try to say otherwise
plante has set up a plan to promote french in montreal.
coderre will sit on his steak and do nothing to defend the french.
there is a big difference between saying that people speak several languages in montreal and saying that it is bilingual to allow people to deny the french fact of montreal.
and it is thanks to bill 101. without it, montreal would become another copy of the english-speaking north american metropolis. everything would relate to english and the city would lose what makes it unique in the world, the fact that it is the largest french metropolis outside france.
i don't understand the stubbornness of some montrealers in wanting to anglicize the city, as if the fact that montreal is unique in the world was a flaw.
all cities are multilingual.
it does not change that montreal is a city whose official language remains french.
and this, even if this simple harmless fact triggers francophobic outbursts.
montreal is a multilingual city whose common language is french.
what is the third language? is the third italian, arabic, spanish, creole, chinese, greek or an indigenous language?  something else?
whoever is going to spend the most on any language loses my vote altogether.
agreed. and i love montreal like that.
i'm pro-plante, i actually think she'll do a better job.
but this is not where coderre is particularly pissed off. he has h. parizeau in his team who wants to work on this a lot.
all
of the above. i’d say arabic and spanish has a higher speaking population over italian and greek these days. not many young italians speak it or their parents anymore. same with greek..
so holness is not an option for you
plante has louise harel on her team.
the team to defend french in montreal is projet montreal.
desjardins was the real champion, but he doesn't even show up.
so…. montréal isn’t trilingual?
sure, but he wasn't anyway.
> i'm pro-plante, i actually think she will do a better job.
i literally agree with you. i am only qualifying by saying that this is not coderre's weak point.
plante does not make me particularly trippy but this big ham pisses me off so much on my nerves.
a few weeks ago they had a short debate on the airwaves of 98.5 and he was just trying to denigrate the plante team and to cheer them up when he himself was very disrespectful.
he is a liar, a hypocrite and a fool who has as much ambition for the good of the citizens as the shit i shit this morning.
gossant
one thing that's terribly inefficient is your ad blocker.
all these coderre advertisements everywhere make me really wonder about the financing of his party. indeed, before the start of the campaign, there were newspaper articles that reported on the hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt that ensemble montreal is dragging against the war chest of nearly half a million mps. yet we see coderre ads in all newspapers, social networks and other media. where does all the money come from for a very expensive advertising campaign like this? two things one, either pm uses every dollar very badly or coderre has an inexhaustible source of money. however, donations are capped at $ 200 per person in an election year ...
addition: article on party financing: i recommend this article from la presse: debt of $ 424,000 for ensemble montréal 
coming from the chiale guy who lingers too much on his personality iiih boy
the smog affects the memory of montrealers, it seems ... to vote again for coderre .... ciborium .......
i gave denis coderre a nickname: "business"
because that's the only thing he has in mind: doing business with multimillionaire entrepreneurs to make their business flourish in montreal, to the detriment of residents, their quality of life, the image and heritage of the city. city.
who cares that mount royal is hidden by tall luxury condo towers downtown? who cares that the said large towers will in no way contribute to the densification of the city since they will mostly be luxury residential towers for almost single investment use and will not be inhabited. and he doesn't give a damn that all it's going to do is contribute to the increase in the price of real estate. because, it is good for the "business".
he also does not care if a land near residences, which could have been used as a natural park in a working-class district, is transformed into a large container yard with large trucks which will circulate there day and night and which will stink the neighborhood, making dust and a ton of noise for all the residents around, because it is good for the "business".
he does not care that a whole sports stadium is built at taxpayer expense for the benefit of a wealthy sports team promoter, who could have paid for it himself, because it is good for the "business. ".
he wants to encourage the coming of even more big events organized, again by wealthy promoters and companies, to the detriment of neighborhood activities that can stimulate the economy for small businesses, because he wants to put montreal on the map. ", because it's good for the" business. "
this is counterbalanced by the densification of neighborhoods such as rosemont, mercier-hochelaga-maisonneuve, verdun, la petite bourgogne, saint-henri, pointe-saint-charles, the village, the plateau mont-royal where there are many old, decrepit buildings that could be turned into modernized 4 to 6 storey blocks of flats that could help densify the city for real. or that very large spaces could be converted into a park to give the inhabitants of the pleb the chance to go to rest a little and do outdoor activities. because in truth he doesn't give a fuck.
i hated him before, but now that he's trying to look like austin powers i hate him derisively.
competent
yo it's aggressive
gettin some weird [mussolini vibes]( from this.
lol, that's terrifying. 
it might be actually be a mistake, but "page takeover" ads are actually a thing. they're meant to do exactly what they did in this instance, make you notice the ad because it stands out so much.
trying to convince people of what he's not.
there is a fake smile from the face of mud
so tired of seeing his smarmy face everywhere
for me it is these radio ads where he shows himself as the messiah of montreal in relation to security and these new signs which capitalize on the feeling of insecurity of people by associating coderre with security. big trump vibe
sibole could at least have diversified their creatives. i work in advertising and i sincerely don't think that we would approve of a dreadful dressing the same
every ad from coderre makes me more and more likely to vote for holness
my gawd🤣🤣
his high school councillor makeover cringes me out
come on, stop it with the stabbings!
is it just me or have things become really tense? it feels like everyone is looking for a reason to fight. even i've been feeling more on edge, especially driving, it's like a free for all.
seriously. i saw 2 guys yesterday on milton, throwing bikes at each other. at 4pm. i don't know, breathe deeply, go take a walk, ejaculate, do something for fuck's sake.
is it me, or things are getting crazier out there ?
[deleted]
a lot of dog gods
time to ban all the knives! if it looks sharp and pointy ban the knife!
[removed]
thanks to you the problem is now fixed.
[deleted]
people have always gotten into fights, at the close of bars, over drug deals, domestic disputes etc. the difference is that people carry and use knives now. 
the media wouldn't report on fist fights so that's why the jump is so significant.
yea i noticed this too
>go take a walk, ejaculate, do something for fuck's sake.
done. what now?
crazier than when? it was a hell of a lot crazier than this in the 70's.
i live in this area and have been for the past decade.  perfect description of that building.  since it's a women's shelter, there have been no issues.  back when it was a crack house filled with the area's first nations, it was hell to live around here.
just have one question.  what do you mean by nazareth house rents the basement apartments.  i think they only rent to women with backgrounds similar to what the shelter caters to.  
i've been a little freaked out since the stabbing in the st-marc tunnel, but now, i dunno.
what a hero
finally!
i completely believe you...
knives are a new hip weapon that people are starting to carry and use nowadays.
> all the candidates agree on one fact: the pandemic has not helped the situation in the borough of montreal-north.
>
no shit, who expected a pandemic to fix anything .. kept people confined, the loss of jobs given the situation, etc ... surely not going to improve the situation.
how many millions should we add to the 680 that the spvm is already receiving to improve the situation exactly?
will prosper, hahahaha
so believable.
a phone call to the street gang he himself founded will do the trick to lower the violence.
coderre is not happy that his bad actions of the past were remembered in the memory of the population before the vote ...
-complains about a "dirty" campaign
-continue his misogynistic bullshit of "pink glasses" that he has been repeating since 2017
okay, denis.
i'm going to vote today finally, i think. it's time to put it back in the garbage.
my advance poll for plante today. you go girl
it's not the countryside that's dirty, it's coderre who is a big bastard.
coming from the guy who keeps saying that the new administration doesn't know how to manage a budget because of the deficit when he was good at managing it while the present administration had to manage the covid, it's not too credible.
"pig covered in shit complains about mud slinging"
awaille home for good the barniques.
his whole equile from em to lachine is quite pathetic, it was 2 months of complete and non-discreet dirtying, he has nothing but him to blame. it is a bit stupid the hatred propagated, all this for ti-boats at the base ...
coderre is really passive aggressive and unpleasant on a personal level this year.
i don't like coderre, but i don't understand the link between "rose-colored glasses" and misogyny ...
it depends on how you see the budget management, including the covid measures. deficits are okay and there will always be some, but some have the right to find current or past management questionable, covid or not.
as far as i am concerned, in addition to paying taxes, i am also a tax payer. when i see the municipal government investing millions in cycle paths during the first wave of a pandemic, justifying that it is to help distancing, before turning around and going to ask the provincial for help to finance its aid programs for companies that are suffering, i have the right to find the management of priorities questionable. this is my healthy example of justifying that my priorities were not the same as the administration in place during the covid.
doubtful situations in relation to the budget, there are and always will be, and the priorities will never be the same for anyone. however, the attitude regarding the analysis of this (fiscal) aspect is very often dirty, it must be admitted. it's too easy to justify the covid hole in the budget, and it's that kind of attitude that's unhealthy in my opinion.
we must not forget either that we are in an election campaign and that everything is unhealthy when we leave, starting with the partisanship that takes hold of this municipal election in montreal, which is normal, but which also too often falls into the dirtying on both sides by its increased media presence, and that too i find that unhealthy.
conservative attacks are always projection.
quite clearly there is a mysogine tendency when he claims that the mayor's vision is a unicorn and pink vision. i can well believe that people believe that pm is shovels of clouds but to hammer out that plante sees everything in pink is clearly a mysogine attempt to make believe that only a man like him can manage the city. while she surely did it better than him when he had the chance. he does not base his argument on his skills but on the fact that he is a man.
it was his favorite dogwhistle in 2017 to ridicule plante's positions and the very concept of a mayoress of montreal.
i completely agree to question the administration of the city's budget and quite frankly i still don't know who i'm going to vote for. what i regret is that coderre used a little empty sentences just to criticize vision montreal and there he complains that the countryside was dirty.
this attitude is disappointing especially because it reminds me of the old coderre who didn't listen and just ostracized those who were not yes men.
otherwise i am absolutely with the points you bring and indeed we do not want the covid to have too broad a back for the city's taxation.
i see it more as a way of attacking someone who has a more leftist ideology. qs qualifies as such, including nadeau-dubois ... i don't think it's misogynistic.
in 2017, plante spoke of the pink line as if it was something other than wearing rose-colored glasses. there was reason to accuse him of not having his feet on the ground.
that this is his favorite attack, ok, i understand (and that is weak as an attack). but did he really make a connection between "mayoress" (the post) and "rose-colored glasses"? i doubt.
the majority of the arguments against plante are hidden sexism. she smiles too much, she sees life in pink, she is hysterical, she does not know how to manage a budget ... what do you think if you take a step back?
not badly sure that gdn is much less associated with rose-colored glasses than manon massé and the other women of qs.
that doesn't mean coderre is on purpose sexist, but he's really quick to associate plante with characteristics associated with women and negatively connoted. like the rose-colored glasses (too dreamy not serious enough) or the fact that plante is not serious because she laughs (wtf) or that she is not strong enough to be listened to (it is sure that with all the coderres of this world, that does not help).
there is a lot more sexism than one thinks in politics.
hello once again, as a gesture of thanks i wanted to post the finished product of my work since some of the folks on here were interested in it. i want to thank those whom directed me to the much needed source materials, they really helped be grasp the mental gymnastics that was this pavilion. in addition, i learned about a fascinating event in montreal's history and got inspiration for future projects from expo 67. for some context i had only about a week to finish the project from start to finish and such the recreation isn't perfect as a result. though i am happy about how it turned out. the objective of the assignment was to recreate the wooden truss structure of the pavilion and do structural analysis on it. about 99% of the project is chipboard and bass wood (the only materials i was allowed to use) and lasercut to get the geometry correct. this project was a challenge but a fun one. 
the past post: [
great follow up op that's a cool maquette
thanks for coming back, impressive model !
montreal has a long and rich architectural history that pre dates and continues well past expo 67. from the many basilicas &churches to saint joseph's oratory , roger taillibert(olympic stadium), ludwig mies van der rohe's westmount square . bank of montreal's main montreal branch at place d'armes(john wells 1847),udm roger gaudry building by ernest cormier to name just a few and if you want to include landscaping you count mount royal park designed originally byfrederick olmsted who is best known for central park !
the mcgill school of architecture is over [125 years old]( making it  of the oldest architecture schools in north america and the training ground of a fair number of [well known architects](
tl;drgreat work, come for a visit …pack a camera and sketch book (tablet?)
there will always be a welcome mat laid out for you when you are ready to come to montreal for a nice visit.
thank you! i’m glad you posted your finished project, looks pretty cool.
cool.
tanks for taking the time to share the finished product!
i see the sign from my home, it has already been there.
lol
lol
let's fucking go guys
good initiative.
divesting is theater - it doesn't change the demand for oil. we do not burn more or less depending on the dung value of the producers.
pics or gtfo :)
its changes their ability to develop further. the petroleum industries depend heavily on investments of such kind ...
let's say that rbc is deinvested. the price drops, the dividente's yield increases, someone else is going to buy. in any case, with the interest rates present, no oil company is going to sell shares to finance itself, it is enough to borrow, it is practically given.
even in an imaginary world where canadian oil companies disappeared, other countries would close the gap. we cannot solve the problem by blocking production, it must be solved at the level of consumption.
except that this same investment can be made in renewable energies.
i think you don't understand the point. the ecologists do not say to close the doors to the oil company, they say to stop the financiers. they can continue on their own profit. also, we have to realize that the only reason why the oil industries in canada even have a chance to sell the most expensive oil to extract anywhere on the planet is because we finance them. if we do not finance them, this material becomes too expensive to extract and the competition will go to saudi arabia (which is already happening in the last 20 years). it is not to close the doors that we say to stop financiers, but to give this money that goes to oil to sustainable industries (as mentioned by the other commentator, can you explain why you think that renewable energies should not be the recipients of this money?). closing the doors would cause a huge economic crisis and its slowing down our ability to approach this problem.
from your logic, climate change will never be solved. the majority of consumers cannot buy electric tanks and / or make decisions that will help the planet because it is absolutely not affordable and / or the information needed to make these decisions is completely hidden. in addition with the constant greenwashing (with impacts not only neutral but negative) it is extremely difficult for consumers to make these decisions. to put the catch on consumers is not only to force people to pay for what they cannot pay, but its excuse the actions of the oil industries which put us in a situation where billions of lives (if you are a capitalist, hundreds of billions of dollars) are in danger.
we must also recognize that the industries made the decision in the 70s to kill the company in order to make a profit for the time that remains. literally, they angry scientific groups to determine the danger, and when they got their answers (which hasn't changed since) they made the decision to hide the reality and compete against themselves. if we can charge the tobacco companies for doing just that, we can at least stop giving away money for free to fossil fuels.
i am not saying that consumers should do nothing, but that at least if the company would be able to provide a reachable option for everyone it is certainly possible. what stops us is over 100 years of lies (inefficient electric tanks, inefficient renewable energy, the fundamental religiosity of capital supporters) that have forced society, through monopoly, to have only choices that inflame the problem.
i did not understand sorry i do not know, teach me?
we are overflowing with capital, i think that's a very bad excuse.
in the last century we could perhaps blame the lack of information, but i think it has been at least 20 years since that is no longer the case.
> can you explain why you think renewable energies should not be the recipients of this money?
false dychotomy, it is not because an investment fund does not invest in oil that it will invest in green energy. as i have already written, we are overflowing with capital. if elsewhere we do not build enough solar / wind / nuclear / hydro it is much more by nimbyism than by lack of capital. of course, in quebec, the question does not even arise, we are practically 99% green electricity, it remains to convert the fleet, but we have a good adoption rate.
i could teach you but i have to charge
dude, i don't know if you've seen it, but in 2021, false information (from both the corporate and individual side) is on the rise more than ever. you will not win this one, i guarantee you.
know for sure that we are well placed in quebec, with an incredible rate of renewable energy! on the other hand, the climate crisis will continue. and quebec (montreal, quebec, trois-rivières) are in enormous economic danger caused by the rise in sea levels for example. "mitigation mode" is the way that a well placed nation like quebec should act to ensure its sustainability in the coming century. would you like to give more money to prepare our future for the voice of the facts (economic, ecological, and social problem), or give the same money to people who are going to want to do more damage for their own good?
are you a capitalist? would you like to continue doing capitalism? what would you say if you realize that capitalism is in peril because you can't do capitalism without an environment that produces goods? investing in climate change becomes the only action necessary to ensure the continuity of this intrinsically exploitative system my chum!
duuuude why do you think that if someone wants effective means, it is because they are against a cause? this attitude is unfortunately so widespread among environmentalists, no wonder that so little progress is being made.
when did i say that? in fact, my argument supports the idea that individuals, as not responsible, should not be forced to have only ineffective choices for their daily lives in order to solve the climate problem. you said that consumers are responsible for making good choices. so you're basically saying that if someone is making more efficient decisions, at the expense of the weather, that they're not taking responsibility ...
very iconic indeed
post traumatic shock
yes, i love it! i want to open a store similar to the ampelmännchen store in berlin, but instead of the little guy in the pedestrian signals, its a store with different object in the shape of orange cones
please tell my you have a hat!
whoever wears that, can i ask you to stand somewhere for a while?
ponto would wear that for sure!
bonus: it can also serve as a costume for "the most fucking fat salmon sashimi in the atlantic": d
it is really successful.
took me a second... but what you did there...i see it.
lmfao nice one :p
whoever wears this and gets his ass ran over is for sure not getting a dime from the insurance. :p
nice idea, but it looks more like salmon when viewed up close.
i didn't realize this was r/montreal so i was zooming in to see if there was a city skyline or something to figure out this "landmark" 🤦‍♀️
a lot of people are correctly pointing out that it looks like salmon sashimi. any advice on making it look more like the cones?
if montreal had a sports team, this design would have to be that of their uniform.
vlc
i love it! how did you tie it for the pattern? i'd like to make one too.
great for saving a parking spot for a friend, just wear and stand.
camouflage
bravo!
the one thing i always found weird about this site was the pavement in front and the parked cars.  they should have some nice landscaping instead and park the cars a bit away from the center.
beautiful shot.
awesome shot but what's that big ass hole they digging up in front for?
gorgeous. thanks for sharing
it looks like shit, too bad they tore it all up looking for bodies smh
it was an expansion/renovation. there were indigenous remains on the site, they needed to be evaluated and removed. then covid hit, there were zero tourists for 2 years. construction company had already been paid, however cost over runs, and they have no money left over to finish the renovations. i'm sure they are focusing on the new observatory up top first, which brings the tourists, which brings the money.
this abomination really needs to be converted to the t of a giant mtl.
jesus’s cross wasn’t iced out like that in my elementary school catholic classes…
new rich
on!
care to share your camera & it's settings when you took the pic?
the lights make it look all showbiz close up like this. great pic!
i’m an atheist, born and raised in montreal. leave the fucking thing alone! it’s a historical marker. it’s cool.
[daytime]( photo 😉
omg what a brilliant idea! add m & l
certainly 😁 to be fair, i used a cheap portable mini-tripod 
showbiz jesus! let it shine!
it's an ancient roman public execution device. it's macabre.
as someone who is colorblind, this color scheme is rough
coderre * barf *
i expect pierrefonds to be solid red this time around and a large part of rosemont
any projections based on current polling?
“plante-green”
i see why you did there…
this is incorrect, as lasalle went with independent party (equipe lasalle)
right along class lines... funny how that works
it still amazes me how much it makes no sense how the city has holes.
people who live on the island and use the city's infra should be a part of it.
money and the ethnic vote?
why are there white areas?
i'm amazed at how territorial this is.  so few battleground areas.
i wonder why parc jean-drapeau would have the right to vote, the same for the industrial district to the east of the stadium. do parks and businesses have the right to vote in the municipal government? or does a constituency include these areas? thank you
so montréal north voted coderre? interesting, as part of the debate related to montreal north specifically.
i expect plante to win as holness takes votes from coderre. i imagine in the more anglo/allo -phone areas of this map, you'll see where holness bites into coderre's base.
the large squares are areas with almost as many inhabitants as the small ones (industrial areas) should not be fooled by maps like that! a larger area of a color is often misleading (same thing in qc or can)
i see, downtown is telling the rest how to behave.
is it not odd that 3 of montreals richest neighbourhoods don’t get to vote? what’s the story there?
it's just b l o c m a j o r i t a i r e everywhere.
what is your opinion on the coderre vs plante? why are you voting plante?
plante disgusts me.
woke, anti-french, anti-secularism. a small $ 2 that holness will run for the plq for the next elections.
holness took that cleanly. it's ridiculous that anyone would vote for the other two after their terrible terms as mayor.
good plan for completing the plq.
it's sad that we're going to come together with the caq in the center, qs on the left and the pcq on the right. the media debate will be focused on the unreasonable proposals of the pcq or qs, instead of debating more centrist ideas. the caq will have a good time saying that they are the only reasonable choice.
hopefully pspp will work a miracle to have a strong center left party.
the irony is that to say that there is anti-french and anti-secularism where there is none is woke!
holness is a joke that couldn’t keep his own charity from falling apart
i have doubts. these policies are popular with english speakers and some allophones. i find it hard to see the plq disappearing from montreal. but i can hardly see him coming back to power now that the elections are no longer "referendum".
i just accepted an offer for a new job! small salary increase but i spend full time at 4 days / week! tabarnak, it's going to be good for the mind to work less
column from a high school teacher: good the famous halloween day at school ... the moment when i take a fine step because i give lessons / evaluations instead of doing like many of my colleagues who take advantage of the day to show films to the students. no kidding it looked like a movie theater in the school in the afternoon.
i dressed up, i bought candy to give to the students but crime we lose so many days in the year (not to mention that we have difficulty recovering from the last two years) that i cannot shift everything yet. 'a day. am i too old school?
have you ever woken up to a nightmare?
(gather round boys and girls. it's story time)
woke up this morning and headed for the bathroom.  on my way, i walk face-first into a cobweb thread dangling from the ceiling. 
gross!
as i'm washing my hands i feel my shoulder itching. i look at my reflection in the mirror and see a couple of small red bumps on my shoulder and another couple of the top of my arm. wtf is that?
i take a closer look and the bumps are about the size of a pinhead.
my head is also itchy. i find a bump there and another one in the back of my neck.
i have no idea what those bumps are but they itch like mad.
i go back to my bedroom and open the blind. there is a baby spider on the window sill. i open the window and fling it outside. 
as i turn around i can now see dozens of these little cobweb threads dangling from the ceiling.
i can make out a concentration pattern towards my closet.  i walk to my closet, with my hands in front of my face, this time, so i don't eat the cobwebs.
i open the closet door, turn on the light and look around. sure enough, there is an open spider nest in the ceiling corner of the closet with 6-7 baby spiders walking about.
not looking forward to giving all of these little creepy crawlies a one way trip to dyson world tonight. will have to empty the closet, move all the furniture and vacuum floor and ceiling.
i'm pretty sure i'll be having nightmares for the next few nights and be itchy all over.
i wish you guys a happy halloween weekend.
hoping we have a ton of kids at the door this year.
i come from my supervisor shift at school. i dressed up as axl rose. two little girls came to ask me what i was in costume (normal, their parents must have been teenagers when guns was the biggest band in the world) but the kicker is the kid who came to ask me why i was not disguised !! 😂 no, i don't dress in leather from head to toe with two kilos of bracelets normally!)
worse, i taught a mini michael jackson to moonwalk!
to the guy in the mr. incredible costume biking on st-denis this morning as i left the gym, i hope you have a fantastic day.

friday is ravioli.
this week i made a ghost costume for my 3 year old kid. oh boy ... never again.
are there any mcdonalds on this island where i can get a mccrêpe?? the bagels have come back but still no mccrepes at any of the ones i've checked. i'll take a communauto to laval or blainville if i have to - this is getting desperate!
edit: closest one i've found so far is in ottawa.
flu vaccine, it's done, it hurts less than the one against covid
a little surprised to have had a date this week. (click health in a pharmacy at the corner of the street).
i think i'm good for a bit of getting stung.
my mid-term is over and i need to concentrate just enough not to fall behind. my job is going to close for the month, vrm happy, because i vrm need this break to rest and relax. otherwise, the routine what
where are the pet halloween photos!?
does anyone know if the big skating rink will be set up in parc maisonneuve this year or was that just a covid thing? i really hope so, it was so nice! i can't find any info online, just last years dates. i got my skates sharpened and am so ready for winter!!
[deleted]
i am in the same situation. when i told my students that we are doing work, they were disappointed. i even have students who told me that they will not come monday pcq they have parties on sunday evening… halloween is fun but it's not a day off. i am a sec 4 science teacher and we have so much to cover and catch up with over the past two years, unfortunately i don't have much time to waste.
😱
ahhh this is a literal nightmare!
>. ya spent the summer shitting tacs when he heard crickets.
it's been 5 min. that i laugh. thank you
physical fitness
solidarity!
> i even have students who tell me that they will not come monday pcq they have parties on sunday evening…
these young people really need to review their priorities. not to mention the parents who will probably justify their absence ...
it is definitely the responsibility of the parents. too bad to see such situations.

in fact it's going to be closed every weekend in one direction or the other until december for preparatory work.
for the rest we do not know yet.
i can promise you he's gonna have a nasty good chunk of stuff when he comes in great shape with all the mass of the heart.
absolutely. if anything now is the time for massive investment
the public transit is one of the things that i love about the city to the point where we just moved next to the metro so that i could sell our car.  i was hoping they would talking about investing more into the transit instead of less.
on a related note if you want to see a real good series on how to make effective city planning i really suggest the [not just bikes]( youtube series.  it really got me thinking of a few places that could really be improved in the city.
well, it's not good news but it's not bad news. it's just what the provincial government should do anyway. good on them.
what scared me however is that i clicked the video linked in the article, with coderre saying we need to rethink the stm. he says the stm was wasteful by maintaining full services during a pandemic. so i'm sure all essential workers had cars and subsidies to call uber and taxis in order to avoid spending money on public transit to move the citizens still essential for society to function. if the stm would have done like private coach companies, they would have reduced services, packing the remaining departures with even more people, and making social distancing impossible, until it's just not profitable enough and simply cut all the services on the line altogether.
i know because i needed to get to drummondville a few times last year and fucking orléans express simply cancelled **all** their stops there. there's no profit in it so fuck the people that didn't have any other options anyway.
the stm and the artm have maintained services and it allowed people that still needed to use public transit to move around and practise social distancing. reducing services would have crammed more people into remaining buses and trains and be more dangerous during a pandemic.
coderre's next sentences trying to whine on the stm were not even coherent, just dropping buzzwords like "pink line", "electric buses: bad", "we pay for nothing". it's so bad, i can't stand hearing him talk. 
and i'm afraid that if coderre is re-elected, he will continue to criticize and privatize the stm to give priority to the rem and private entities.
i feel like the word deficit is very misleading when you consider the money the government saves from less cars on the roads and the money they make from helping businesses around the metros themselves
when it comes to something like mass transit, the question must be, is it worth a deficit to provide this service?  i think the answer is yes while agreeing that they should try to minimize that deficit
however, if the alternative is charging the user more or having less service, i'd rather live with the deficit because it is a service that is both essential and should be universal to people of all incomes.
agreed im mad when the bus is early or late, but im happy their is a bus though.
>the public transit is one of the things that i love about the city to the point where we just moved next to the metro so that i could sell our car.
lots of people share this opinion. it's in fact why housing is getting so expensive. there are relatively few transit-oriented areas so people need to compete to live there. we need to keep investing to preserve this quality of life.
the pandemic has really shown how irresponsible neoliberals are, eh?
it pisses me off because we pay billions to subsidize the automobile, but it is considered a "loss" if public transport is not profitable? what are our taxes for if not to pay for public services?
to be fair stm, cit, rtl did reduce service during the pandemic and again in 2021. they didnt stop completely but some bus stops were removed temporarily, less frquent busses, less frequent subways.
not sure about stl and other networks since i dont use them often.
>coderre saying we need to rethink the stm. he says the stm was wasteful by maintaining full services during a pandemic.
i haven't taken the stm since march 2020, but did they really maintain full service on all the busiest lines too? i assumed that there'd be a bunch of empty 105s and 165s and that they could scale them back during rush hour at least without any noticeable impact on service. in the old days there'd be 105s back to back to back and they'd all be full.  
i do agree cutting on lines that are already infrequent would be awful. you don't gain much taking a line from every 20 minutes to every 30 minutes but it completely screws over everyone who relies on it.
we had pretty good passenger train service until all the highways were built. when my family came here in the post war years they would take the train often then got forced into buying a car… one of 6 on the block.
careful, the media isn't designed to show its readers that there's such a thing as nuance or complex situations! you'll break their brains!
yes, but have you ever seen a business paying stm because their store is near a metro station?
oh coderre has been showing his irresponsibility and incompetence well before the pandemic.
pay bonuses at bombardier
the stm at first drastically reduced service, and the result of that was insanely crowded buses for the people who still had to go out during the first lockdown.
no they didn't maintain full service. 
i have two friends working for the stm (one metro operator and the other bus driver). they stopped hiring new drivers/operators. they didn't replace those leaving. they kept the holidays/weekend schedule pretty much all the time when everything was in lock down. 
i applied to work at the stm as a bus driver in 2018. i started the process in 2019. it stopped in 2020. no news since then.
thats not how it works, the metro stop helps businesses make money, businesses making money helps the economy, the economy pays for the metro
he is quite competent at promoting the interests of his constituents. you are a business or corporate entity right?
attack of the trees
there was a pretty violent wind storm a couple days back.  some older trees will have cracked.
person six feet under: "tree's blocking my view of cdn"
ah am calisse.
it's going to rain: the trees fly low.
have you ever seen fallen trees? lol
there is presently an absolutely inexplicable number of fallen trees around lille from montreal. no one can explain it. it is a confusing mystery.
the trees are quite old. as they are not replaced, they end up falling off on their own.
thank you for explaining why this is happening.
he should have called it the "montreal basketball club" with a snowflake logo / s
i just want to make sure that this is the league which broadcasts it's matches on cbc sports? if so, sign me up. if much rather watch homegrown talent than waste my time with the nba.
should be on cbc next year i imagine
we could just build a huge condo to swallow up the entire island and save time.
[just a reminder, this is currently considered "regular/light traffic" on decarie, they are not addressing the crazy influx of traffic this project will create in the area](

*judge dread enters the chat*
this is how i thought to eliminate homelessness in montreal!
but they don't care. i still do not understand why the government of quebec did not intervene in this file.
imo it’s about time that cavendish gets extended, it’s the most feasible traffic mitigation measure and royalmount & blue bonnets are going to make the area hell without it.
(yes i know it’s been spoken about for 50+ years, but with these two massive developments going up we need some type of mitigation)
the traffic there will always be ridiculous. at a certain point, adding more will just encourage more people not to drive and to take public transit instead (see [
to be honest, i don't see why tmr should be prevented from making a new development at royalmount when no one cares about all the traffic blue bonnets or all the developments out west or on the north shore will generate. no one is screaming at vaudreuil to pay towards expanding the 40 each time they authorize a new residential development.
if we could $ # @ join cavendish. half of the traffic embarks on this section to take the 1st exit, thick ones pass by the line which blocks 2 lanes.
the whole area is gridlocked almost 24/7. until they extend ~~decarie~~ cavendish (which still probably won't be enough) they shouldn't develop a damn thing.
even if you're not pro car, it's such a choke point for people going from so many places to so many others that it needs to be resolved just for the sake of all the wasted hours of human life.
thats been ongoing there even before the construction project. i drive it everyday and i have not noticed a marked increase late 2019 and now.
that area is <<next to>> a public transit dead-zone lol. i used to work around there on the north west side of the 40. it's either bike or car, forget about buses. 
edit: thought the condos were farther, my mistake! see corrections below
[deleted]
this sector is boiling with existing and proposed potential. there are 650 condos + townhouses in citémidtown, in addition to quinze40, sax condos, kubil tmr, smarturbain, etc ... not to mention the potential of blue bonnets, plenty of condos on st-louis in ville st-laurent and of the triangle of cdn.
for many people, living close to major motorway transport axes is an asset in their travels. not everyone has to go downtown on a daily basis.
there is a metro station nearby (de la savane). the plan is to create a mix of commercial and residential that will allow people to live without a car. it is a very good project as it takes around metro stations that are under-exploited.
speculators, out of towners moving with their cars, older suburbanites?
my guess.
hochelaga-maisonneuve is already "old rosemont".
even better, each "neighborhood" of this giant condo that covers the island would have insignificant names of real estate project.
*i* am willing to play squash against you.
it is holness who will decide on the town hall, it is unbelievable ... it is the mélanie joly of 2021!
keep stealing votes from coderre, thanks big!
the difference is that plante voters are much more motivated to vote. i predict a lot of coderre pro will stay at home.
1 in 5 allophones who vote for holness ...
i feel like the americans who had to choose between trump or hillary
not great choice on the menu
coderre often complains that plante and projet montreal did not allow postal voting for the 70+ and that they are doing just that to take votes away from coderre. this poll suggests, however, that plante and coderre are tied for seniors and that this excuse is therefore bogus.
in short, your yeule denis. ultimately, postal voting should have been offered to all age groups. but hey, young people vote less for you so we shouldn't help them to vote ...
holness remains a non-candidate. this famous "momentum" that his supporters seek to prove is slow to materialize one week before the vote. this is a good thing.
mouhahaha !!! montrealers are going to re-elect coderre so much !!! smog affects memory, it looks !!!!
god...more than anything, i want this election to be as close and as controversial as possible.
... can't believe people will vote for plante - bastard again. she's just going to keep ruining and destroying the city. cursed limit to widen sidewalks, reduce roads, eliminate parking lots and endless perpetual works.
we are not in a village - montreal is an international city - wake up !!!
bye bye plant! 🪴👋
honestly, he also steals votes from plante (among anglos / allos pro definition of the police, for example).
i can't wait to see if thibodeau will break through. no media, he's not endorsed by “the club”, but his “grassroots” electorate is highly motivated.
but coderre voters are older and they vote much more than young people where plante receives 42% of the voting intentions
is there any info on voters certain to vote in this poll?
edit: yes, with a slight advantage for coderre on this point. plante and pm will have to work hard to get their vote out.
and i hope there are more ...
hillary's way worse than plante.
so let's see. plante and coderre are much better trump or clinton.
freedom of choice but nothing to choose from
that's democracy!
except that clearly i would like coderre better than trump or hilary 😅
giant turd vs. shit sandwich
live south park!
spooky!
my friends on the south shore bought a few records before the pandemic, we played a few times and honestly it's really cool! in st-jean-sur-richelieu the municipality has transformed a semi-forest park adjacent to a retirement home into a disc-golf course, 7 "holes" (goal-net) it seems to me, after the pressures of a group of citizens (players). it's nice to see enthusiasts being able to carry out projects.
but to answer your question, they bought their stock on the south shore, not montreal. i see no specialty stores in the big city on the internet.
yeah, ditto for me. i know of a store in boucherville which is in the recreation center, but it is more products for swimming and their inventory is not what i would qualify as "selection"
i'm trying to avoid doing montreal-sherbrooke-back for a larger selection of records but it looks like that.
is holness and coderre working together? because they keep tag teaming against plante.
i open it up to coderre calling himself the candidate for change. 
even after closing the debate immediately, i've still wasted my time watching it!
holness clearly took that. insane that anyone would even consider voting for the other two clowns after seeing their terms as mayor.
[ , trying to understand why plante is so agressive toward holness gesture.
talking about ice removal also, sorry but nothing got really done, it's mostly the same and snow removal sectors were merged mostly meaning companies got  bigger routes with the same amount of equipment. gps or not to track which routes were done won't change nothing if the people at the city who make the sectors don't know well the boroughs.
i won't even mention how the corruption got worse because of that.
it’s a slow motion track wreck
not a fan of any of them, won't vote.
a debate in english in a french-speaking city.
i can't stand coderre, but it seems natural that opposing candidates would target the incumbent most.
wait so montreal's economy is bad, and coderre will fix it. but then when plante says that montreal has the best "relance economique" in the country, the mayor is not responsible for the economy. wait, which is it?
have you ever seen a federal debate?  trudeau is basically the anti christ and everyone must vanquish him.  was the same for harper, chretien etc.  the incumbent always takes a beating at the debates.
unpopularity opinion here. but she’s trying to play the victim again. anyone else notice how she was constantly pointing her finger at coderre at the tva debate.
im shock that snow removal corruption and productivity is not even talked about, i guess we can't expect much of a change in the years to come from the city itself until the borough start to eliminate snow contracts bidding.
anglophones exist and vote.
the flag of montreal has symbols for the natives, french, english, irish, and scottish.
of course one of you had to come out of the woodwork.
when will you see a debate in spanish?
yes, but for holness, it would have been better to try to take the "challenger" spot from coderre than to simply attack plante.
but at the same time they are ideologically the opposite so i would assume that he would attack coderre more but oh well, i guess they are closer than i thought
plante is right about that.
pretty much. afaik, snow removal became a bigger mess under the current administration. in the district where i live, benoît dorais - the turncoat prick made sure things got worse when we needed snow to be removed in the last 4 winters. and now that we have that stupid cycling track undercutting the number of available driving lanes right on st. jacques street, it will get even worse during the upcoming winter.
seriously, fuck project montreal regardless.
the stairs will surely be closed for 2 years to repair the bent end of the handrail.
cursed mountain beaver.

i do not understand how in 2021 the taming of untreated wastewater is tolerated.
there is no money left to fix the problem once the mayor and her ceo pay each other their salaries.
steroids and styling products must be bad for fish.
there are 2 aspects.
the first is that the municipalities of qc had until 2014 to install wastewater treatment facilities. a bunch (43 i think) haven't done it yet and the government is not imposing any penalties on them
second, the current rules are that municipalities are entitled to emergency discharges. the rules for what constitutes an emergency are unclear and the govt. is not very severe there.
finally, possibly as important, but it is not known, many municipalities do not have a wastewater discharge data capture system.
[the article in le devoir] ( d 'today is very well written.
it is mainly during thunderstorms that the pumping stations do not supply because of the infiltration of rainwater.
doubling or tripling the capacity of stations to treat all wastewater, even that diluted by rain, would be enormously expensive and no one wants to suffer tax increases.
i would add that these concerns are very recent. bcp don't realize that most of these factories were built in the late 1980s / early 1990s.
think about it, barely 30 years ago, all cities in quebec threw their wastewater into waterways without any treatment. we have come a long way in such an environment.
yes and no. in montreal, huge retention basins are currently under construction or were recently built for exactly this reason. the water from thunderstorms is accumulated there and then gradually discharged after the end of the downpour. the largest is the lavigne basin, which is not yet in service. there is also, for example, the william basin and the ~~ rosemont basin ~~ which was completely renovated 2 years ago. by doing this, there is no need to triple the volume of the entire network.
edith: i was wrong the rosemont basin is in fact a drinking water reservoir. however, there are several other basins, including a large one in pointe-aux-tremble, one in lasalle near the river and certainly many others.
there are plenty of solutions other than increasing capacity (therefore less expensive) to, above all, prevent solid waste from overflowing.
very easy solution. the unit network (wastewater and rainwater) is replaced by 2 separate networks during renovations. no need to oversize and the water goes where it should go, ie the river for rainwater and the treatment station for waste and industrial water.
the st-laurent must have resembled lake springfield: your linen dissolves when you come into contact with water and produces squirrels with 48 eyes.
arrangements to retain and slow down the water load are excellent and relatively inexpensive ways, but it takes time to see real impacts and in the meantime, longueuil will continue to have overflows with each heavy rain.
sorry, but where is the location of the rosemont retention basin?
by the way, there is this retention basin which has greatly helped people in the area near garibaldi park in saint-léonard.
[
closing the gaps would be ideal, but it would be even more expensive.
retention basins can do some of the work but it is not cheap either and almost impossible to do without astronomical costs in already developed places.
we can foresee the basins in the new developments and try to reduce the asphalt, but i don't really see how to correct the errors without having to pay top dollar.
(big price which involves asphalt, pipe and earthworks, so a lot of pollution)
i'm not against all that, a swimmable river is the dream, but are people ready to pay?
i think it mixes with the rosemont reservoir, which is a drinking water reservoir, so not all the same function.
i was wrong, the rosemont reservoir is indeed for drinking water. i am going to correct.
that's what i thought.
not against.
it takes transfer centers from large trucks to smaller ones for the majority of deliveries.
also, must still allow for large deliveries, adjust the hours so that it is less cumbersome possible.
except that all that adds to the bill, it takes people to transfer the content into smaller trucks, it takes drivers.
projet montréal had proposed the ilot voyageur project as a dumping center for large trucks. i never heard the rest of this pilot project ...
see this 2019 article: 
purolator was also involved: 
check well, if denis wins the elections he will come and say that he was the one who had the idea ...
edit: it looks like the project is on the move. completely expelling the heavyweights would not be stupid either. 
if you bought it, a truck brought it.
no shit. most of us have been saying this for years. it’s just not pedestrian safety but also emissions
one class 3 reefer truck or 8 mini vans. chose your poison.
restaurants need supply's as do grocery stores.
an effect of density that is often overlooked. population density + local businesses means that there must be a lot of local delivery traffic.
too many coderre in the streets of montreal, say the big trucks.
i wonder if a time restriction on trucks would be feasible. essentially no large trucks during morning/evening rush hour
first sane thing this buffoon said from a nasty butt.
it applies to all the streets of the islands (besides the highway) or just the city center with the surroundings?
i can't wait until this coderre parasite goes away for good.
the reality is that there are hardly any semi-trailers in montreal: the vast majority of the local is done in cubes, straight bodies or sprinters.
the idea of switching the contents of a grocery semi-trailer in order to multiply trips in smaller vehicles is ridiculous: we have enough pollution and vehicles on the roads like that without having to 'add more.
this electoral affirmation of coderre aims to take the same straight line as plante in the field of "fuck tanks and trucks scare me", in order to divide the vote of all who shit on gas without using their brains. the average voter is aware that they will not have an electric bixi sofa delivered in a limited time slot, nor will they pay for their broccoli $ 8, nor want more traffic and pollution.
that is not what he was saying in the debate on monday.
so how do we make the deliveries? unless ... we just have to destroy 60% of the businesses !!!!! yeahhhhh !!!!
trucking industry is a strong lobby and slow to change. only way to force is by legislation. also classic “but the consumer will pay”
it's pretty much exactly what projet montreal has already done with colibri, isn't it?
the problem is "local traffic only" which is never respected.
there is no reason for a 53-footer to pass over gouin (residential area) apart from avoiding henri-bourassa traffic.
enforcing these indications and keeping the big trucks on the boulveards would already be a clear improvement
and that's * more * trucks so * more * pollution! ....
seems to be small packages only, right? it is not by electric bike that they will deliver beer to convenience stores ...
but it doesn't have to be a semi.
apart from the more residential sections in st-laurent, henri-burassa is pretty ugly. a rem on the platform in the middle of h.-b. would be a better solution. it could connect to the rem in acadia and go to the east end of hb and connect to the metro.
i'm getting convinced that this type of brt-lite infrastructure (100% dedicated lanes with signal priority, that any bus line can use) should be implemented on most boulevards. this will become even more important once the rem comes online and people need to get there fast. it will only be as effective as we make the walk/cycle/bus portion of the journey  unless we're ready to pay for rail at every 1km or so, this is the next best thing (but no, buses shouldn't be a trunk line, they should be feeders).
it's a cheap way to get high quality transit now, and it's not like we're missing road space... if the capacity/efficiencies demands it, we upgrade accordingly.
i grew up on the west island, and lack of fast buses makes them basically useless for anyone who can afford a car for residents or for those who work there. but if buses could be as fast as a car (or at least not get hung up at lights and in traffic) then we have a winner.
not exactly the same cost.
agreed. that would be a big improvement for a reasonable price tag. as long as it is frequent, convenient and connections with the metro/rem networks well thought through, it is going to be a big plus for everyone. the beauty of it, is that if it is successful it could be later upgraded to a tramway/streetcar service since the right of way would have been already established.
exactly. there, we are talking about 60 million, which is quite reasonable.
and that would already be a big plus for these neighborhoods.
60k of passages per day is so huge for a bus line!
population density in the northeast of the city is quite high, i'm curious to know the% of my population going by bus and metro vs in cars, in this sector
surely quite high, despite the fact that the metro is far away. montreal-north, for example, is not rich. there are probably a lot of people who don't have a car and who have to take the bus / metro to go to work.
chinatown is my favorite place to go after work. montreal wouldn't be the same without it.
it's such an awesome neighborhood - it would be a devastating blow to the city if it were to disappear :(
really well-done; the interactive elements were especially nice.
excellent article by the cbc
great piece
sad to see no mention of jimmy chan :(
bit of a noob question, though which candidate would be best at preserving chinatown in montreal?
he was on cjad the other day plugging his new documentary. 
yeah i know him personally, he's an awesome person!
the man, the actor, the engineer, the cook, the sifu, the lion dance guru etc... jimmy is more than invested in his community.  the chinatown "police force" is another of his doings.
this man works a lot for chinatown, i cant think of chinatown/chinese community without thinking about sifu jimmy, he's in like 9 out of 10 committees/associations in chinatown
according to rumor, it was denis villeneuve who produced the legendary uqam lip dub in 2009
i have kept this photo several times and i loved it. the governing goat of our time.
quebec universities seem embarrassed to show off their sports clubs, their academic achievements, their heroes.
as if wanting to be good was bad.
and there we have denis, the best goaler in the aces league on the ice.
* by the way, the profits go to the right place for your christmas shopping.
didn't realize this movie was directed by a quebecer. i might just go see it now.
denis, proud of his roots! 😎
there's more to the future than the girl from uqam.
proud of my alma mater, hehe
the simpsons and uqam:
represent!
too cool.
cool!
the most beautiful cegep in the world ❤
an internet bot picked this up since this morning's upvote count huh
to go to uquouam, do you have to get off at berri-de montigny?
i wonder if uqam will sue him for this like they did with that onlyfans chick
if he only spoke french he would never go to hollywood
that was his main project of that year if i'm not mistaken
the uqam lipdub is easily the best video produced in quebec and nothing will change my mind.
i don't know anything about that, can you share the video please?
for real? at the same time, there would just be villeneuve to do a school lip dub that can be picked up [more than 11m views] ( so that seems very plausible to me.
edith: got had, the description names two other people in the realization.
projet montreal is still a better choice than denis' charlatan & corrupt party.
any progressive party who gains power will slowly concede to both keep power and implement policy that is still progressive than the alternative.
plante is far from perfect, but coderre wants to cede everything to the great fortunes of real estate.
progressives are always bitching. they also see compromise as a bad thing.
sounds like fundamentalist christians.
die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain :)
yes. vote balarama and end this nonsense
no, and that's the problem. ferrandez has killed the plateau, and plante is trying to apply the same policies to the rest of the city.
she's unbearable. voting for balarama
unfortunately, this.
exactly. that doesn't mean that progressives further to the left don't have the right to complain about refocusing / trying to pull the cover off their edge, but it's normal to see a little refocusing when in power.
plante in power must not only manage the tensions between the members of his party (which range from the center-left to the more radical left), but also those with other voters, other parties, etc.
is this in reference to chomsky?
is the board dead? is that so
the plateau would be a better place to live with more tanks ???
he killed the plateau for the people who cross it in tanks to go to work.
> ferrandez killed the plateau
lol. my quality of life here gets better every year. 
i'm really looking forward to the new outdoor theatre and new public park opening up this year. the upgraded children's park will be nice too, but i'm more excited for the aquatic centre they're rebuilding after that's done.
wtf. le plateau is a model for the rest of the city.
i agree. they suck!
vote for other people.
balmara seems to me less progressive than plante on several issues.
imagine calling plante “unbearable” and then turning around and voting for holness, the least bearable guy there is.
sadly you see other people who want her to go away, but for what, one of the biggest crooks we've had in year? i'd rather have a mediocre mayor then the other asshole we kicked out. coderre is a corrupt piece of shit, it's so obvious that anyone under 50 voting for him has a case of brain rot.
pitbull account for 66% of deaths by dog attack. you people saying that pitbulls are no more dangerous then other dog breeds are ridiculous. you can't argue with statistics.
wow a comprehensive list that clearly shows pitbulls kill more then any other breed. that wasn't hard to find or hard to process the information. i just scrolled through the list of all the poor souls who happened to die from dogs and something stuck out, pitbull sure make the list a lot.
then charge the owners of the dog with the exact crime committed by the animal. your dog killed someone?  you killed someone.
people argue that breed isn't the problem but the owners, then fine.  just make the owners take full responsibility then.  
your dog killed someone?  off to jail for 10+ years.
your dog killed another dog?  off to jail for aggravated animal cruelty.
i like the literally translation from french vs breed.
impose the owners classes to go with their dogs every 2 weeks or so for an amount of time per year. classes where professionals can not only teach them how to raise and own their dog, but also so these professionals can look at the dog's behavior. if they disregard these classes just make the owners very very liable if their dog attacks or kills someone shit even put in a jail sentence in there. i believe this will filter a lot of the fucking douchebags getting dogs just to "look cool" that cause these dogs to have a bad reputation because they are piece of shit owners.
one of the main reasons i voted for her was to remove the absolute dumbfuck 'big dog' laws enacted by coderre, this isnt exactly news.
breed bans are bad ideas because the breed of a dog is not what causes problems.
this isn’t a secret. the data doesn’t support breed bans. it’s why most vets are against breed bans.
here’s [one study about fatal attacks in canada]( you can find similar results from studies in the us:
“the american staffordshire terrier, the most widely legislated breed in canada in the period under study, caused 1 fatality (table 1). the rottweiler, a target of breed-specific legislation in fewer jurisdictions, and the husky, possibly an unlegislated breed, caused more fatalities, as did the mixed-breed dogs. the rottweilers, huskies, and the mixed-breed dogs were also represented in larger numbers.”
(edit: lol, i'm amused that i'm getting downvoted for science.)
that great until the dog kills another person
guns, pitbull, same arguments.
sounds nice and fair to me.
some people - probably fueled by some hysteria in the media - are still not aware that dogs like pitbulls as an example are often just aggressive because of their trainers/owners.
recently i dog sit a labrabull and i was so surprised how gentle and playful those large dogs are if they grew up as part of a family (as opposed to a neglected dog or one with an abusive owner).
coming from europe i think the worst influence/media we had over there were skinheads with a tendency to own pitbulls with the intention of intentionally training them to be aggressive (the kind of dog personality that's famous for biting and never letting go again).
i love dogs. when i was 4-5 years old up to maybe 15 yo, we had pit bulls and other large dogs. pit bulls were the best dogs we had. 
pit bulls (and mostly all larger breeds) may be dangerous if the owners do not know how to handle them properly. 
doing 160km/h on the highway is not dangerous if you know how to drive at that speed and if you have the car to do it. we still put speed limit because of crazy drivers that do not know how to drive. 
also like firearms. firearms are not dangerous... but owners may use them in a bad way and may not be able to handle properly. thus we put restrictions in place (and we may want to restrict or ban them further). 
why would it be different for dogs? even if i don't like this idea, i believe we are at a point were we have no choice to put restrictions in place, specifically for larger breeds.
“excellent” (proceeds to import llama to the plateau)
plm pitbull life matter
we love dogs
yes! those fracking pitbulls will be able to attack new kids and citizens!!!!
fake are we gonna be able to have a gorilla? a lion? a wolf?
it is absolutely thick as an attitude on the part of plante, to please the pro-killer dogs.
one more reason for her to loose.
maybe they attack just as much as other dogs but their attacks are much more lethal. that's like saying we shouldnt ban grenade launchers because there are just as many pistol attacks.
statistics may be biased because people think pitbulls are good attack dogs: people that want their dogs to be menacing might give their pitbull a poor education which will result in more pitbull attacks, reinforcing the view that pitbulls are more dangerous.
you might not be able to argue with statistics, but if you torture the data enough, it will confess.
they attract shitty owners, people get them to intimidate others, they tend to be much, much cheaper to get compared to other breeds. their attacks can be much more dangerous than other types of dogs. 
it's just a lot of factors that influence those statistics. like why most prisoners in the usa are blacks when they're a minority.
two hypotheses:
- pure random.
- a very passive-aggressive way of telling you that you're "crazy."
probably someone who put them there thinking they might interest a passer-by, and if not, they'll go for recycling.
if you have a mini library not far from where you live, you could bring them there.
a hidden message?
someone who has decided to retrain in another field.
once i found a bag of golf balls next to my recycling bin. 35 bullets exactly. yadda yadda, i learned how to say "titleist" the right way.
hmmm, if you're wondering, it must be a gift so ... 🥸🥸😜

if it's university textbooks resell them, you can easily get $ 30-80 / textbook depending on the state
i think the same!
thats a face that screams "i have a legitimate job, and i earn money legally"
breach of release conditions.
i would never have dared to believe it by looking at her beautiful face. looks like an angel.
i know one who is going to buy foundation for the first time in his life.
i'm minding my own business if i see him on the street
this guy looks exactly like the generic low-level criminal that gets killed by some supernatural/sci-fi entity at the beginning of the movie. you know, just some unlikeable goon that you won't feel bad to watch die.
he's gonna be hard to find with a face like that...
a good little guy.
what's funny is the guy's description. don't worry, just say he's facetious.
*the year is 2199 and rival gangs have taken over neo-montreal...*
i will avoid the how on this face, i have confidence in you, you will do it better
c'mon now, maybe he works as an actor/waiter at the haunted house themed restaurant.
hooray poor people can go to the states now!
i’m a vermonter here only live 90 minutes from montreal. it’s been 21 months since i have been to canada and we have missed it so so much. we ussalt come up for nye and my birthday which is halloween every year on top of truly a half dozen or more sporadic weekend trips and multiple day trips. we are finally coming to montreal this weekend and can’t wait 😭.
yesss baby
i thought they went bankrupt!
i used to take it all the time between ottawa and montreal, will that be the case in the (near) future?
how cheeper is it compared to flying?
my friend was a driver on this route for years. he loved spending every second night in nyc!
is it worth taking the bus for a quick 3 day trip to nyc ?
[deleted]
that’s not good, greyhound is a horrible company
i wonder if the adirondack train line is planned for a reopening too?
the delta variant approves. s/
*those who are vaxxed and who are not so poor that they can afford the pcr re-entry test (if they wish to return).
just in time! the cones are slowly starting to hibernate 😊
welcome back!
happy to have you, welcome back :)
happy to have you back! is there any good places to visit the opposite direction? i'm from the uk and the u.s. is still novel to me, would love to visit a bit more now things are open again. taking a day trip on a bus to the u.s. is a really fun idea.
> i thought they went bankrupt!
greyhound shut down their canadian division, but cross-border routes were not operated by the canadian division.
~$150-$200 bus round trip vs $320-$500 flying
edit: also, there's no need for a covid test when entering the us by bus.
what i've done numerous times in the past is drive down to albany, park the car for a long weekend, and take the greyhound all the way to nyc. it's a budget-friendly and easier way to travel so you're not driving or in a bus for more than 6 hours.
(edit: deleted extra words)
that's only because the train service between mtl and nyc is woefully deficient. otherwise it'd be flight>train>rideshare>drive>...>bus. and if we had a bullet train, it'd be train>flight>rideshare...
denis who continues to defend him ... ya really learned nothing hin.

party conspiracy for the other unknown guy
it's not bad at the provincial and federal level, with the name of the jurisdiction instead of the word “provincial / federal”
quebec liberal party
i left quebeccois
quebec solidarity
coalition avenir quebec
federal
conservative party of canada
liberal party of canada
exception is the bq and npd
what about the signs?
what do we care to see their faces? we want to promote the strengths of the program, don't we?
at the provincial level, the major parties that we have all have quebec in the name:
- quebec party
- liberal party of quebec
- action démocratique du québec
- quebec solidaire
we make jokes, but seriously, there aren't really any quick fixes.
a party name can't have 15 words in it. so yes, it is a vague and unifying slogan. after, there are still peaks of programs to detect through.
projet montréal because we want to develop new ideas of scale.
together montreal because we want a ruling coalition.
mouvement montréal because we want things to change and quickly.
not for nothing that for the two biggest parties, the full names that will be on the ballot are "ensemble montreal - équipe denis coderre" and "projet montreal - équipe valérie plante".
otherwise there would surely have been a lot of confused voters who could remember who the project, the ensemble or the movement is ..!
i like the pro-austerity party of the south shore, the longeuil cup
ok it's beautiful i'm going
me all i see is crosseur montreal, fraudeur longueuil, chialeux saint-lambert etc
the green party for plante would be perfect. tagada boom!
after that, you shouldn't put "party" in the name of each party!
"linkedin clout" party: montreal movement
party "well it was not so bad than that tsé": montreal project
party "reeeeee! bike paths!" : together montreal
it is written as complotiss so that they are able to read it 😁
i don't know him all, so i have no idea what you or him are talking about :-)
there are a lot less signs than there used to be.
i compare today to the elections of 86 and 90, when my mother was in politics. there was 1 rcm sign 1 post out of 2, and the other was vm.
1 party put deragotoire tights on the opposing signs, we spent evenings putting pledge on the posters to prevent the stickers from sticking. : p
i have the impression that today everything is played "online"
anyway, it's not a bad thing that this visual pollution decreases.
this! same thing with real estate or mortgage agents. their faces everywhere. if i buy a house, i triple the face or the name of the broker. i want to know the price and the advantages of the house, not that it is marie lafourmie who takes the calls and organizes the visits.
can't chase that clout if you're not plastering your faces everywhere. or look like a budget dystopia figure just in time for halloween à la denis. ("**compétence**")
the only posters i've yet to see that are text/ primarily text are some big projet ones with like 5 words on it, so lots of empty spaces... or action montréal ones that are so text laden i knew he was a weird online rant type before the chief used news of a dead cyclist to post about undoing bike lanes...
is caq not coalition avenir québec?
me neither, but i decided to do my homework as a citizen yesterday after receiving the letter from election montreal with all the above candidates. i started by entering his name on google and immediately came across the conspiratorial comments he posted on his twitter. i have tried to give a chance to the candidates who have not had the chance to be represented by the media, and i can tell you that the lack of background is not their only problem. but at least i know i won't vote for a mediocre major party by ignoring an interesting minor party.
such. what the hell are we on the face of the broker that you will never see ... we want the price and the number of coins ... exactly as you say.
yes, i had a bubble and i remembered dumont's old party instead of the one in power now 😂
late but if ever someone wondered why they are no longer on the list.
that sucks. now i have to go all the way to olympic stadium, when the vaccine loses effectiveness in 5 months.
i've seen a few videos/articles like this and i think it's the first time i'm seeing the park ex one at #7. it's a favourite of mine and i wonder if it's not that well known cause it's a bit in a weird place. great video as always capitaine!
this guy's videography sucks. clean your lens ffs
i did a series of videos back in the days and i went to a lot of different neighborhood (i.e: i left the plateau), thats when i discovered this one.
it's not serious, ms. plante will just ban the firearms which are already banned by an even more severe ban, it will just change nothing because the vagabonds do not buy legal weapons anyway but it will be nice in the news so there's that.
we can downvote these posts at some point. it doesn't help, it's redundant and u / eric_bousquet puts 40 meals a day.
ben block it, seems to me that it is not complicated?
imagine wanting to put your head in the sand to the point of censoring news
me too, i have nothing against him personally but i don't catch why i want to transfer / r / montreal to the montreal newspaper ... this is right next to it on the web, no need to link all the police articles / facts- various on / r / montreal ... entéka, my block it thank you for the tip ,.
i hadn't thought that it would block his posts on the page too (and not just the comments).
thank you
new ideas about policing tend to emerge in greater quantity and quality at small parties. when the gatherings are too large, people aren't really able to get into deep productive conversation.
for any troubles in the subway, the person in the ticket boot has access to call security, don’t hesitate to go to him.  
edit : don’t hesitate to go to the stm website and leave a comment in the complaint and comments section. most of those who harass you are already known and will be taken care of swiftly. but do it quickly, all security footage are only kept 48 hours. keep note of the station and the time of said event.
as a healthcare worker who takes the subway daily, things have gotten worse since covid-19 started. with less people taking the public transport, these individuals are more visible and there's not necessarily a rise in mental health issues. but statistically drug consumption (whether it be legal or black market) is on the rise. add into the mix layoffs, the cost of rent and the inflation, it'll get worse before it gets better.
i think it's a mix of mental health and drug use up significantly, generally - hell, among richer residents i believe alcohol consumption is way way up, you can imagine the shelters and the streets. 
still it's not new york in the 1970s around here yet, or even sainte-catherine in the 1990s - some people are really exaggerating here. maybe i'm weird but i can deal with some crazy while mental health/social services try to catch up. the violence is the real issue and for that i fully agree a few extended popo visibility campaigns in specific downtown areas could really help if social services also does a lot of work on this.
maybe file a complaint with the stm. they might or might not do something about it.
it is. 
the pandemic happened, it was harder to get drugs, no one to ask for spare change, hospitals and mental health ressources overwhelmed. mix that with the fact that there was already a migration of homeless people to montreal...
i've lived in verdun for more than 12 years. i've seen the neighborhood go from poor/eclectic to full of hipsters to going full gentrified with families and now i see lamborghini and hummer in front of restaurants. the homeless crowd has never been bigger than what it is now, and i don't feel safe walking on wellington when the sun is down. 
last month, someone threw a wallet in my face at lionel-groulx. like you, i've seen people trying to start a fight with randoms on the subway. i see more cases of people begging in the wagons or shouting or spitting everywhere. 
i hope ressources will be put at the right places to help those people and assure the safety of public spaces.
i live in the village and things have absolutely deteriorated big time. i completely avoid walking on saint catherine’s if possible, it looks like some apocalyptic, dystopian, wasteland.
definitely gotten worse.
i hear screaming outside nearly evening night now.
huh, sorry to read that. i hope you're okay now.
do you mind sharing what line and what stations it was at?
i get downvoted every time i mention it, but it remains true: the health and safety of metro users has been * officially * at the bottom of their priority list for a long time. for the stm, the stations are first and foremost a "point of service for people in a roaming situation" and for them it takes precedence * before * the preoccupations of metro users.
someone here called me paranoid last week when i said that the metro is no longer safe ... it seems that i am not alone in finding that it is the case!
henry george 1890s: progress and poverty.
the more you push up land prices the more extreme poverty you get.
the latest increase of "help" to first time buyers from project montreal will increase prices further, pushing more and more people into extreme poverty.
crazy. i don't ride the metro much anymore but when i did circa 2010-2014 i never worried about pickpockets... i always keep my stuff safe and with me though in general (on metro or anywhere) but maybe i was just lucky. around the same time i visited paris and was amazed at how many times the automated message would remind us "attention aux pickpockets!" on their metro (at least once every ride)... and i never heard that here at all.
station?  time?
i never encountered anything worse than a lunatic screaming i want a damn smoke...(at bonaventure) i feel bad for all those incidents i read about.
do i scare them away or what?  they dont even bother asking me for chnage lol
it's crazy, maybe it's more visibility due to the lack of usage, but the metro feels much less safe. downtown also, pan handlers are more aggressive and more present. i was walking downtown this weekend, and was asked for money over 15 times in the span of two hours... it's frankly disheartening. the juxtaposition of 5 guys offering $18/hour and a person sitting right beside asking for money... wild times.
if you think this is bad, you should see what vancouver looks like right now. at the very least, check /r/vancouver for some first hand accounts. some escape from ny type shit for real. no politician has convinced me that things will ever get better. unless you run to the hills, expect police policy to push the problem to a jurisdiction near you.
i think pretty much everywhere is a little worse. 
during the day, less concerning but definitely more concerning at night. bc you can tell that they are more affected by whatever substance -- or more in need of it. 
it's not a metro thing or even a downtown thing, although both of these now have more problems than they did before.
sunday evening, it's suspicious in the center. it's been like this for a long time. no classes, no stores, no offices etc.
omg word - my sister just got home and told me she was grabbed, followed,  and almost searched by a homeless woman at beaubien
more cops do not make things safer though, they only react to crimes they dont prevent them....
my advice is always look pissed off when you're going outside downtown. that'll get people to leave you alone- i'm by no means imposing but i have a (so was i told) very masculine face and rbf. that has helped me a lot to make up for being otherwise quite thin
covid really screwed up a lot of things and people. i'm sorry you had to go through that. 
my only bad experiences with homeless people were one guy kicking my leg and shoving his hand in my face while i was napping in the metro and another guy begging me to go to an atm to give him a 20 after i gave him 7. he left angrily after 3 stations because there's no way i'd go to a atm with someone i don't know.
i avoid the orange line now because i feel like i'll snap someday...
sweet jesus, we're in trouble.
i live in lasalle.... our er is already suffering. this closing means pile ups in verdun and lasalle, it's going to be even longer to be seen (like, even in real emergency situation....i waited 5 hours to even get called back with suspected "gotta check it, you might be septic" appendicitis)
why are nurses not getting vaccinated, wtf is wrong with these people? don't they see what happens when someone gets admitted with covid?
no wonder they keep pushing the date for the vaccine mandate in the health sector.
"lachine hospital will close its emergency room between 3 p.m. and 8 a.m., 7 days a week"
8 am to 3 pm? i don't want to judge, but it seems a bit extreme to me. the shifts at this hospital are from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.?
from my experience with this hospital from 10 to 5 years ago, that was always the case. anytime anyone showed up there after 5pm, they were either transferred to another hospital or left waiting until the next morning if it was deemed that they weren't about to die in the next 24 hours.
so with a decrease in service, my taxes will go down? 🤔
for real, i really have trouble for the less fortunate people who live in the area :(
and if we suspended unvaccinated employees it would be a lot worse, unfortunately.
yeah this is not just bad for folks in lachine, but really anyone remotely near. it will just spillover.
they probably don't.
mainly infirmières auxiliaires with lower education and probably not as exposed to the places where covid patients go to die. out of sight out of mind, if you want.
those people are simply uninformed and self centered.
you can basically see a direct correlation between how direct someone worked with covid and their rate of vaccination.
a good exemple are respiratory therapist (inhalotherapie). they literally put tubes in out of breath dying covid patient... and *drum roll* they are getting vaccinated at super high rate. because they know the need
why don't you temper your expectations about what other people should do?
the director of the stats program in quebec emergencies, dr. elyse berger has just resigned, probably in protest.
i worked with her when i was working in the emergency room, she's like an a1 in the system, you can hardly do better than her when it comes to understanding, intelligence, proactivity, etc.
and, she resigned. you see the kind ?
if i can trust my experience (my hospital is only in the 3rd line), from 3 p.m., requests fall on the evening shift. it gives the day shift time to finish their notes and all the paperwork. this is the only explanation i can see!
last two times i’ve been there i was out within 4-5 hours. it’s a small hospital that some just avoid all together. guess i got lucky. shame because it’s a few blocks away
same is true at other small hospitals since there is only one doctlr for the night taking care of the waiting room and patients in beds. they tend to prioritize actual emergencies and beds before waiting room patients. the other problem has been the horrible first line access. very few people can get a fast enough appointment at clinics if at all
it is high time for the public to initiate a class action lawsuit against the ramq and the ministry of health.
haha no! in fact, we must increase them to ensure a quality of service! mwahahahahahah
i don't know pk we downvoted you. it's the truth ... it's stupid but if the govt suspends the unvaccinated employees, we will live through hell in the network .... but cibole ... get vaccinated ... it's over time....
and keeping them makes it more dangerous for everyone, ~~ next ~~.
edit: the dash was too rough for nothing
if any redditor here gives this open mic a shot, i will personally go see you perform and applaud you as your show starts and ends.
so wait, karaoke is still banned because of sharing a mic but open mic is ok?
hopefully this is still a thing in november when im back around
every week we have someone who is trying stand up for the first time - could you be next!?
the absurdity is undeniable. i don’t make the rules, i just follow them.
i believe its the singing because of increased droplets
we will still be around in november. you can check out our facebook page for updates:
no. i lost my legs in an industrial accident in the mid-2000s. so i will absolutely not be trying to stand up just for your puerile amusement.
i hear ya, i was just curious.
* it went on the news * 🤪
tragedy+time=comedy?
okay. i will go there and try to stand up on my stumps. just know that it's not going to be pretty and probably quite humiliating for me.
if you want to see people humiliate themselves, this is the spot!
aka known as winter.
jesus christ this guy's voice is horrible to listen to, i couldn't even make through 5 seconds
also known as known as
you’re gullible, that isn’t a problem for anyone but you to fix.
hey man, can you wire me 100$ ? i just lost my job, thanks
you basically got robbed.
>i also would like to know if this is an issue that should be addressed?
you need to be more street smart, that's what should be adressed.
also this post seems so fake, how did you know he had a iphone12pro both times? why would you give him any money then, he can sell the phone for 1k$ also why would anyone go to an atm with a stranger, you're basically being asked to get robbed. did you also gave him the card nip# because he wouldn't take no for an answer?
congratulations, you just helped a person buy street drugs.
as a business owner downtown, i know a lot of homeless people, some very nice ones and some not so nice.
they all have this story of having a good job, money and, often, a house and then becoming depressed, losing everything and ending up on the street. yet, once you dig a bit deeper, they eventually admit that their drug habit drove them to the street.
the government has numerous programs to help these people but first require them to enroll into a detox program (as to not throw the taxpayers' money down a bottomless pit). most who make it out manage to get off drugs, those who don't refuse to let go of drugs.
i am not kidding, those who refuse detox prefer to live on the street, because that's how strong addiction can be.
it’s a con as old as time.
pleaze send money.
you got played man.
=it's just another "gypsie scam", we have belly tumor guy, war vet guy, daughter needs medication guy... im sure there's quite a few we havent heard of.
and before someone asks me "why are they scamming people if they obviously are not broke?" 
the answer is simple... why not!? (they say) you could make an extra 20$ of some gullible dude... or you dont.  if your conscience is 10 miles away, you'll pull that shit, even on an old lady.
don't get played.
parents need to teach their kids about crackheads and junkies before they move to the big city 😂😂
that person behaviour is a problem. unfortunately yours was too. he they do that because it works.
sweet summer child
some guy outside the entrance to lucien-l'allier was begging people for money. dude was wearing a shiny north face jacket and had brand new white shoes. i told him to fuck off and he did, he left the area lol.
those kind of people are looking for crack and an easy way to buy it, nothing else.
common street scam, be more street savvy blah blah blah
what i notice from this story is that he used to ask for 20, now 30. hyper inflation is happening, people!
they always have sob stories. locked out of their car, need money for bus, need money for a cab to go renew their prescriptions. tell them if it's an emergency you can call them an ambulance, suddenly it's not going to be an emergency anymore.
hi, has anyone seen my iphone 12 pro?
if a guy asks me for $20, i say no. if he insists and follows me, i call the cops.
classic. this same guy tried to dupe me 2 years ago with the same bullshit.
hey man, i forgot my wallet and i need 5$ for a coffee. i'm also blind.
lol i never give money. if they look like they need it i’ll offer a meal but usually they decline the meal cause they are looking to buy something else with my money …
he got me and i have a picture of him.
it relates in particular to the seriousness of the teams behind the candidates. plante and coderre will have candidates in all districts / town hall (or almost), and holness will have several while the others are more or less alone.
i guess the other parties aren't serious. 
kinda like the marxist-leninist and communist party at the federal level
the vote is divided into three: mayor of the city, mayor of the borough, councilor of the district, in the borough. there are local parties for the latter two which present candidates only in one district. ex.: outremont movement candidates only in this borough.
the same as the federals and provinces ...
you hear about the liberals, conservatives, ndp and the bloc / pq.
the marxsists-leninists, communists etc ... there were like 8-9 candidates on the ballot in bourassa and i only know 2.
same as federal elections
because of their controversial opinion they are better choices for citizens but not for corporations and the media are private corporations with vested rights to remove or change information.
because the media chooses who wins, not the population.
[deleted]
attention has to be earned.
because the media controls the campaigns and not all candidates are high-profile, controversial or "newsable".
yet they present themselves as mayor, and therefore they are everywhere. everyone has the same choices for town hall.
when the threshold to be considered a party (or have your assets turned over to the state) was put into question by mulroney in the 90s, you didn't see the liberals defending our democracy in court, but the communist party. (  
they are a party with limited ressources, but they are not an unserious party.
well at the federal level there is a clearcut rule, either have at least one elected deputy or poll at over 4% nationally before the campaign starts.
it's somewhat silly because bernier scored more than the greens which to me mean there's something wrong with the criterias but rules are rules i guess.
i couldn't find anything related to municipal though, they seem to be excluded for no real reasons.
yeah, but action montreal and montreal 2021 are everywhere.
they present themselves as mayor of montreal, not mayor of the borough.
edit: to clarify, mayors are showing up everywhere. it is true that these two parts have a lot less candidates present in the other roles.
in laurier saint-marie i had 12 .. there was a party for animals like.
people never talk enough about the rhino party for my taste!
this situation has noting to do with the monarchy...
that’s…. not how any of this works.
stay woke my friend
yes, but since they don't have a team, that means that even elected, they should deal with either projet montreal or ensemble montreal.
people who buy cars that are too expensive for their budget, so they have to deliver to get to the end of the month.
chinese of wealthy parents in china.
> i often see fantuan food delivery men (blue sticker on the side) driving luxury cars like new bwms, audi, suvs, etc.
asians. i don't know why, but they like luxury. especially the youngs.
among the asians i know well, from 30 years to 70 years (about twenty people), the "worst" of the gang drives a 2017 acura rsx, which his son bought him, the others are bmw x6, big audi suv , lexus, etc.
2 of them, make an unboxing video on youtube of their new iphone at every release, the same 2 buy all the new yeezy's when it comes out ...
about ten years ago, i went downtown with vietnamese friends and their girlfriends ... ogilvy. i felt so out of place, 1 pair of jeans, sunglasses, 1 belt ... $ 1180
those i know do it only to pass the time or to have money that their parents do not have visibility.
c’est un flex ou show off. you gotta do anything to have a good image and nice cars in most of the cultures and especially they need to show their success to their family back home
source: i’m asian
defined as "new". if you don't know much about cars you can easily take a 2010 bmw with 200k km which costs like 5k for new.
sometimes people who haven't had much buy cars beyond their means to show that they're successful. you just need to be able to make the payments.
parents buy them the cars, and it is not expensive compared to the prices in china. and food delivery can get them some money by using the car. especially during the pandemic, my friend told me the salary was very good at the beginning.
and once more
tl; dr: students for the most part. it's pretty easy as a side hustle and people who appreciate luxury cars even more appreciate valid reasons for driving them.
i notice more and more this classist idea that service employees can never be better off than the people they serve. as if only people in need become delivery men or waiters etc.
wonder since when we went from one of the most egalitarian cultures in the world to this.
i am also curious. there is no one who likes to have their car tagged with a delivery image.
can they be company cars? so the drivers don't own the cars?
money laundering 🛁💰
fantuan in my opinion is illegal. already law 101 they should put their logo and slogan in french and it wouldn't surprise me that they pay the delivery people cash or they are paid directly on wechat or alipay and therefore they declare income 0
i know an ing. senior from wsp who does like 225k per year, and he gets 20-25 hrs of uber / skip / doordash per week more
so why deliver?
that
theres no rsx 2017. it stopped in like 2006
out of curiosity .. did your vietnamese friends pay for their girlfriends' purchases?
it's not "asians", it's "rich"
how old are they for their parents to have visibility on their income ?!
this ^ people are not that car-knowledgeable in general. i often hear people say omg my dream when they see a bmw worth like 5000 while their civic is worth 8000 lol
a little lack of preparation my denis.
plante was cutting too much, but she had the best answers. coderre responded with slogans. if i was undecided, i would have no idea what his program is.
valérie won this debate hands down
coderre said take the bus and ride a bike. someone already passed her on the bus without photographers, let's say?
yep, a bit disjointed on the coderre side ... can't people take it seriously yet?
hon i missed the debate
hmmm
did i miss anything, in fact?
a debate so close in time that i did not have time to make an informed decision.
ouinnnnnnnn that doesn't look good for denis.
he thinks that the corruption has ended 🙄, i must also say that valerie also lacks information especially when she talks about snow removal that the idea of having loads decreed according to the borough is the idea of his party when in fact it was time that coderre was in power.
it's kind of his strategy. he doesn't get wet like that he can't be directly attacked
it doesn't really have a platform other than the results of the last poll.
and corruption.
honestly, no.
your decision shouldn't be based on a simple debate.
imo.
i share this point of view. we put too much importance on the debates (which are more battles of language formulas than battles of ideas).
am i the only one who finds it funny that projet montreal finds hundreds of millions for park repair projects and now urban planning for a single project but does fuck all for affordable housing. imagine the thousands of units that we could insure in the long term if we took these hundreds of millions and only tried to buy the land on the outskirts of the rem-est.
glad that there is at least one candidate for mayor who is concerned about the urban impact of this spit-hay project.
sherbrooke is too narrow to receive the aerial rem. it's already congested and we will have to remove the reserved lanes to install the rem structure, which in the end will have a negative impact on public transit. if this budget and this new position can lead the rem to go underground, so much the better!
can someone explain the logic behind this?
500 million for that and 700 million for a park over descaries .....
vote movement montreal instead of these clowns
in reality, these two themes are equally important and should not be opposed, on the contrary.
we do not want to reproduce what france did in the 60s and 70s, that is to say, build "cities" with idyllic "long concrete bars" where people have been piled up for several years, often less. wealthy and what is more, far from everything, including public transport.
the rem should not disfigure the neighborhoods it crosses, or even take advantage of it to rehabilitate them and build social housing (not just hlms) on a tod neighborhood model but not to the detriment of social diversity. beauty and aesthetics have a real impact on mental health and should not be reserved only for the city center or tourist spots.
edit: grammar
on the contrary, i believe that this $ 500m is probably best invested in the rem to help maintain housing affordability. by offering a direct route to the city center, we are opening up new development possibilities in the east of the city. and since they have a financial advantage in this development happening, the caisse is an excellent partner. whereas if the city invested this money directly in the construction of housing, it could at most build 5,000 units, which would be good but really not enough.
don't worry, i'm sure it's the property taxes that will pay for that, not the quebec taxpayer ...
is affordable / subsidized housing really the right solution to the housing crisis?
it has no real connection, the city does not have the full power to build subsidized housing, it is a shared competence and it is the other levels which retain their share of the costs. it is not to mention that the city does not have the power to expropriate land on its own.
well it's clear that if we listen to the little whining who want us to bury the rem, well you can be sure that we will not have a penny for social housing.
including the 1 billion over 10 years to enhance the park in the east. this is hogwash. plante, coderre et cie are simply not interesting ... or simply find it too complicated i imagine being minuses.
would we still need the reserved lanes for buses if we have the rem running parallel?
i repeat. fuck the underground rem.
i want a transport project that does not last 10 years and that is reasonably priced. in addition it is cool the rails in height.
in life you have to make choices and not, to burn money is not one, especially if it is just to appease the nervous breakdowns of some people who do not like to have community transport in their face.
"urban planning": people come crazy like shit. in times of elections, logic does not exist, only bogus promises funded from taxpayers' taxes :)
lmao mouvement montreal is rapidly disintegrating
accessibility = higher rents, not the other way around.
my personal opinion? no, but it seems obvious that government bodies are in no way interested in making other changes or exploring new ideas by falling back on the only solution they seem to know.
it is a combination of solutions that is necessary but it is clear that it is part of the mix.
1) addition of subsidized housing following the austrian model of vienna
2) improvement of the public transport system in order to allow dense development on the outskirts (the rem is part of it and will allow the development and densification of the east)
3) general increase in the number of units which once again involves densification. so a need for rezoning among others
but yes, affordable housing and forcing real estate developers to include a percentage of lower income housing in their projects is desirable. necessary in fact
love the house foundation joke hahah
saw this in ndg. found it pretty cool to have social commentary masquerading as halloween decorations!
one day terrebonne will have its cycle path ... one day.
i love this house. 
also. who do i vote for to get my bike path back? we have so many candidates and i haven’t heard anything from any of them. 
i have a parking spot, and i pay hella taxes so don’t even ducking start.
they are gonna get fined for it not being 60% larger in french.
“general scientific literacy” - lol savage!
nice to see people having fun with it. honestly i dont think my area will have many kids trick or treating but i hope those of you who can will try and make up for last year for the lil'ones
what are the halloween guidelines this year?
[deleted]
ohh nooo the foundation one. that one hits.
when your social commentary is prepackaged by media corporations
basically applies to all homes in ndg😂
i was going to ask but it looked like ndg. a lot of fun decorations but i haven't seen that one.
i'm fond of cycling myself, but with a cycle path on notre-dame-de-grâce and another on maisonneuve, it's stupid to have one in terrebonne. it is literally 4 minutes to get from the track of notre-dame-de-grâce to terrebonne, so you might as well go through notre-dame-de-grâce. the congestion that a possible runway on terrebonne (which is not wide) would create would create more danger than good. especially in front of the school. too much is like not enough.
for montréal, i'd say the candidate most favourable to bike infrastructure is valérie plante.
it's ok it doesn't include the word pasta
[here]( they are. we will not do the bag thing, we're all vaccinated and don't want to create a mountain of discarded plastic bags...
i'm.... not sure i get the joke?
imagine thinking you are the outsider when billion-dollar corporations are on your side.
i thought he was talking about the city of terrebonne. it makes a lot more sense for someone from ndg to talk about the street. my bad.
the distance between terrebonne and notre-dame-de-grâce is quite large. i find it absurd as an argument to say that there should not be more bike path just because there is one two blocks away. if people are cycling in terrebonne, there should be an infrastructure so they can do it safely, period. it does not prevent cars from circulating. the bicycle should be considered a legitimate means of transport, and it is by creating a dedicated infrastructure that this will be achieved (like civilized places ie amsterdam). you never make a similar argument for tanks "the cars just have to move two blocks away to avoid the bike lanes". but your comment reflects the fact that in america the chariot is king. it's unfortunate, and everyone loses it, including motorists.
edit: your photo is nice on the other hand, thx for sharing.
most montreal story in a while: thank you for sharing this epic tale of disgust and hope. i'm glad your doggie is ok, and i am glad to hear of nice folk. you deserve an orange cone and atleast half a dozen fresh bagels.
geez that sounds stressful. glad someone stopped to help.
why wouldnt you let your dog have perfectly good free fermented rat jerky???
you found my pet rat horatio! is he okay? where can i pick him up? 
seriously glad that some good people came to your aid. sounds like you met the right people at the right time. hope the pupper is okay.
ewww....i swear dogs will eat anything right out of the gutter! taking them for a walk is like the all you can eat buffet.
glad it went okay, i'm sure the dog will survive ingesting the 🤮🤮rat. 
what kind of doggy is it anyways?
over the past year i have noticed 1 dead rat on the sidewalk in chinatown, 1 live mouse on the street in hochelaga, and 1 live baby mouse shivering next to a garbage can as i put down an empty soda can at parc lafontaine. i never saw any before and i've lived in some sketch places... \*shudder\*
> epic tale of disgust and hope
you should be writing book jackets!
trust me it was probably not a cute little rat like horatio!!
omg just the other day i hate to fight my dog to get a dead bird out of his mouth 🙄
he didn't seem to get sick, but will have to go to the vet for some extra medication just in case! 
he's a white german shepherd and husky mix. :)
i live in kirkland and i found mice in my garden shed.  it happens everywhere.
mice are kind of common in montreal. they’re really common in milton-parc. i got one in my apartment last year, and then found 3 on my block the next week. 
but nothing compares to the metro. i see mice or rats like every 3rd time i’m in the metro.
there’s more mice in fancy suburbs with large yards.
horatio was neither cute nor little. in fact, i think he might have been a possum. he/she once gnawed my big toe off as i slept through a vicious bender. ruined my marathon aspirations.
eww seriously. they'll pick up anything....but it's their ancient instincts. he probably saw it as a gift from the pack, lol
must be a beauty! he'll probably be ok, dogs are actually pretty hardy. although apparently, raw salmon is toxic to dogs! and of course we all know about chocolate. 
the rat 🤮 was decaying and the smell attracted the dog. we all know that the most disgusting objects smell like roses to them.
oh my god!!! that's horrifying, sounds more like willard.
i think i need this too. i'm talking to a therapist tomorrow.
also, this sub's obnoxious removal of recommendation threads should stop. that's one of the points of a city sub!
i just finished getting my diagnosis. it was on the [south shore]( i got an evaluation from a neuropsychologist. it was expensive, 1600$ (some of it will be reimbursed by my insurance).
[deleted]
im not 100% sure, but a friend of mine used to go at the psychiatric hospital to change his adhd meds prescription... not sure if you can get a diagnosis, but you can definitly get prescriptions
psychiatrists and psychologist have not formation in adhd diagnosis. what you need is a neuropsychologist and nothing else.
they can be pretty expensive in the private sector, but you can register for cheap (or free?) consultation by students (supervised of course) at universities.
maybe try seeing an occupational therapist  first. if you tell them your symptoms maybe they are in a position to get you to see a "higher" specialist.
mine was just done by my family doctor and its been valid ever since
i don't have suggestion for you, but i'm in the same boat as you, so i'm sending you a lot of love. it is really not better on the francophone side.  :/ (was told the other day by a random lady on the internet that i could just be diagnosed by my family doctor as if i had not asked my doctor :,) )
[ maybe you could have a look there ? you can search by language !
i was gonna tell you but i got distracted
if you can get someone to write you a referral, you can try www.aminy.com
are you currently studying at a cegep or university? most schools have a student doctor or psychiatrist and i got properly diagnosed through mine at john abbott.
[deleted]
i realise this was over a week ago, but i was wondering if you found an answer?
i'm in a similar position to you, my psychiatrist is prescribing me my medication but recommends against getting a diagnosis because it's an expensive process and it doesn't change anything medically speaking. 
however i wish i was able to get a diagnosis regardless because it would provide clarity and help me feel like i'm taking the right treatment. 
what is your plan right now, if you don't mind me asking?
good luck! 
yeah, this one got deleted too until i added the edit and very thoroughly explained to a mod by pm why the other posts about this topic literally did not ask or answer my questions lol!
ouf 1600$ is not possible for me at the moment ): happy for you though!! must feel really great! 🤍
i reached out to her and i’m awaiting a response! just want some more options in case she has no availability (:
can you let me know, too?
hey, would you mind pm'ing me the info ? i am looking for one as well.
could you pm me too?

play stupid games win stupid prizes
people in this thread are missing the point. public health clearly isn't dictating policy anymore, the government is being unreasonable and unfair. i went to a concert at the bell centre this weekend: 22 000 people packed together screaming to latin music, the masks came off really fucking quick (from the pictures i've seen, masks were properly worn by less than of third of the people there). pretending like that's any safer than nightclubs is insane especially if we have vaccine passports. not to mention that many nightclubs have their dancefloors open anyway and business is pretty much back to normal, there's no way that police isn't aware since it's essentially an open secret by now. soyons conséquents franchement, je vois pas comment quelqu'un peut défendre les mesures qui restent à part le port du masque à l'intérieur encore. venez pas me dire que le centre bell à capacité maximale est somehow plus safe qu'avoir plus que 10 personnes dans sa maison (oui c'est encore la limite à ce jour)?!
they missed a great chance to call the protest "dance dance revolution".
we're vaccinated, we want to dance
you can dance if you want, but don't leave your mask behind.
because if you wanna dance without a fucking mask, then you're no friend of mine.
-safety dance covid version
but let's not protest about any of the absurdities this government has imposed on the people who elect them.
boomers don't care about youngsters dancing, that's why
it was supposed to be a march, cops said you can't have djs on the float because it's not registered as a parade which i imagine needs insurance and such. cops apparently gave the option to do the march with pre-recorded music, but the organizers decided it was more important to have djs playing than to actually get exposure to the cause by protesting in the streets.
sounds like the premise for 80s classic 'footloose'. come to think of it john lithgow could do a great job revisiting his role as the stuffy politician playing legault.
wasn’t it legault himself that said “the vaccine is the key to your freedom”? which in itself is a terrifying line. but, doesn’t that imply that we should be living relatively normal due to the vaccine? or was he just tryna say “get the vaccine or we’ll fine you 1000$ for being outside?
[deleted]
when we all tolerated a curfew for literally no reason, we opened the door to things like this. don’t blame the government, blame yourself for not protesting sooner
[deleted]
sorry no dancing - reverend shaw
of all things to protest about... these are the real civil rights activists apparently
that’s explains the huge crowd last night at mont royale . my uber was saying they gather every weekend and that their mostly college students.
i do some chansonier and busking, pretty high level. don't do it now. why? dancing and singing is against the law. been like this a few years now... wtf??  is this the middle east??? strange
3rd world problems...
"priorities"
i want dancing to come back when it's safe, not just because people want it.

i think you did not understand the rules of r / montreal. here, only photos of mount royal taken from the belvedere with a view of the city center are authorized!
nice photos, i like the 4th one :)
great pics! 👍👍👍
are there any racoons right now?
is this a rethorical question? at this point, the mountain has become a single unmoving mass of racoons.
🤣🤣 thanks! i'm gonna go next weekend then. do they hang out there during daytime too?
a little dinner with the ceo of garda pis aweille denis
how about removing cops from doing traffic duties? that will free them up for more important things. the hundred cops or so that just direct traffic in overtime could be much better utilized
acab - more cops are not the answer to anything except more police brutality.
why not give each policeman 2 guns instead?
why not 500
cleansed my nose with some coffee reading this, thanks for that.
studied since at least 2017 but the plante administration has not taken any action:
[
unsurprisingly, the spvm is opposed to taking away double-time paid work from the police. it's the other mafia ...
the first police chief of san francisco said the same thing 100 years ago; police should not waste their energy (or taxpayers money) dealing with traffic; it should be its own separate job.  
police should only have the function of investigating homicide and other violent crimes, maybe then they would actually be able to prosecute rapists.  
but having police do a bit of everything is an intentional scam, they get overtime and pensions and funnel money right out of the communities they work for (but dont live in).
to remove the police from traffic, montrealers would have to prove that they know how to manage themselves in traffic
i'm going to be negotiated in hell, but the average montrealer is so stupid in tanks, bikes or on foot that putting your police in to manage everything moderately helps anyway by my experience
papineau and de lorimier how many police officers are there in traffic every day? 8-12?
another ten on notre dame between the 25 and de lorimier.
the most aberrant (apart from the fact that we pay the police to manage the traffic) is that during the closures of the bridge-tunnel on the weekends which cause big congestion (including a big mess at most of the intersections ) in the axes which go towards the jc bridge, there is no police officer who makes the traffic. like if you're going to give them that as a job, you might as well do it when it's useful?
i am not against.
protecting is good, adding natural environments is better.

vote for movement montreal instead of this clown
depending on the photo it's either jaundice, cirrhosis of the liver, she turns into the hulk or she's in a debate.
the woman is pushing for more green space and that's what you come back with?
the photo was funny.
smile buddy, life is short.
north on rené levesque?? you must be new.
also yes.
yes
officially it is one lane, but if traffic is slow enough that two cars can maneuver, the city expects that people will treat it like two.
the reason is that the bus lane on the right has a wider minimum width than a standard lane, so they can no longer fit four proper lanes across the road. (but they paint that middle one at nearly double width to accommodate the squeeze move rather than marking three super-wide lanes.)
also for reference, "north" in montreal navigation is defined as northwest on a compass. the river is considered to flow east-west, so the parallel streets (rené-lévesque, ste-catherine, etc.) are directed east-west too, while the perpendicular streets (guy, peel, etc.) are considered north-south. you do get some oddities like travelling "east" on sherbrooke past the olympic stadium, where you would actually end up briefly going wnw.
hahaha this made me laugh. when i first moved to montreal i used to make fun of the city to my girlfriend (from montreal) that there are no lines on the streets. and now after 2 years its still a running joke because her response is always "the people decide!".
i actually lived on rene levesque, and while walking/driving it, it's mostly always 2 lanes. i've only ever seen it as a single lane when there isn't much traffic. but majority of the time its 2 lanes....the people have decided.
thats such a frustrating part of my daily commute.
who you calling fat ??
east
two the whole street is a three lane street on both sides and it’s east and west brotherman
depends, is it your mom driving?
depends of if you in a rush or not
it’s neither one nor the other, quite the contrary.
now you understand montreal.
depends how many cars are in it.
already been discussed 3 weeks ago :
i’d say two because it clearly becomes two lanes as you get to st-marc going west. i always treat it as such.
the lines are useful for those who do not have the cartesian spirit enough to separate the tracks so as to put vehicles there without them touching.
and besides, your sense of direction is faulty, boulevard rené-lévesque is an east-west voice.
hell. sometimes it's three.
theres geographic north, magnetic north,  then there is montreal north..
not to be rude.. but it literally says west on the street name 😂
so if i can fit, i can drive, lol
yes
with jupiter in the background (back, back, back ...), moreover!
this might be the best angle i’ve ever seen for this subject.
that sign is perfect montreal: farine = french, five = english, roses = bilingual.
not so long ago it said flour at the bottom. 
unless they’ve changed it, the timing sequence has a gap when the bottom row was lit.
gorgeous. i like to see icons of montreal.
it was super easy to be creative with this subject, but you nailed it!
really great picture! thanks for sharing!
cyberpunk aethetics
halloween vibes 👻
i always found it looked like a cabaret sign. with this angle and this atmosphere, even more lol.
very beutiful!
for the curious, it's taken from this place: 
it's a nice little park with benches under the trees and under the overpass there's an urban gym too. i really like this spot.
and a rose is a flower (flour), so here you go.
jeez i driven by that place a million times and never knew it was there!
pretty sure a rose is a rose.
a rose is a flower.
the pronunciation of "flower" ressembles that of "flour".
i imagine she heard the irish grumbling about the name of the rem station in griffintown ... not sure it will win them over.
i want one for illiterate one-legged people too.
1) the rem will pass by the irish historic site
2) name the griffintown station - bernard landry (a separatist pm who was in power only 2 years) and thereby denigrate the irish community that built griffintown
3) promise a new commemorative space just before the elections.
really trying to buy those anglo votes eh?
bye bye plant
who do you think has the real shot at winning?
hopefully balarama
fingers crossed for coderre, holness is going to split plantes vote giving coderre the win, or at least that's what i'm hoping.
i thought holness would split plante's share primarily, but his weird constitutional positions seemed to end up taking up more of coderre's lane in the end. 
i hope i'm right though, because more coderre would be worse than useless. 
just an absolute regressive move that brings nothing to city hall other than "i'll undo the last person's policies and pay billionaires tax money for their private property if it's a stadium"
i can't wait to see the results, but i rather have the impression that holness is going to steal votes from coderre, he is a lot more popular among anglos and allos than among francos.
i really like his east end tech sector ideas, would help the tax base alot in montreal and maybe make the east more attractive to live in, and he's the only one of the three that's talking about economy which i greatly appreciate. plante is and always will be a single issue mayor, fuck the city and everyone in it, but hey, look at the trees and bike paths for my rich friends to enjoy. i don't take holness terribly seriously, but his bilingual montreal idea is going to pull plantes young anglo/ immigrant supporters who are all fed up of her bigotry and pro police stance.
who knows what will happen though, we'll find out in a few weeks.
if so, i'll throw my support at him, i'm going strategic here.
edit: looking at all the pre-election polls, forget holness, coderre ftw
montreal already has three or four tech sector areas already. its the kind of repeating cheap promise that baits anyone whos not in tech.
and yet i am in tech, and im still very favorable to the idea. weird eh?
well in that case, let's make it city policy. 
also i live out east and it's plenty fine, and rapidly changing without the need to make it a tech centre or whatever. 
we can focus those in our several existing locations for such purposes and leave areas to specialize in other ways later if necessary.
not sure what you mean by "city policy"
we don't have any green / carbon neutral tech centers in montreal to my knowledge, i love the idea of mixing business with green initiatives, bring in more skilled workers, boost the tax base, all while caring about rhe environment. being an island, we don't have much space to grow other than the east either. much more effective than what plantes been doing. montreal keeps losing high skilled people, i want to see that change.
to follow up : the existing tech centers are emptying because of covid, don't need new places to grow.
boosting the tax base means paying people more so that they don't leave, only leaving thoses who put up with scraps. its a federal and a bit provincial issue, not municipal.
montréal and québec and canada as a whole lose high skilled people due to our low wages and proximity and cultural connection to the united states, where they can leverage their quality educations with less debts than americans into well paying jobs down there. 
building a tech park in the east end will not stop that brain drain, and adding another tech park when the others are not full/ shrinking is a terrible decision. especially with covid uncertainty continuing remote work possibilities
honestly, however, la presse says it has no good blood:
it might be time to take a step back from the situation.
there are really a lot of people who are conditioned to climb in the curtains when anyone tries to resonate with them about it but i'll tell you why a bit like nantel said during his time at tlmep: despite the liberal tears and the recognition and insignificant gestures here and there, there is no drinking water on the reserves and the amerindians remain the poorest minority by far in canada, and then instrumentalize them and use them as political pawn that will give them nothing more.
stossel has a wonderful video on the subject (unfortunately on the situation in the usa but it's really similar in canada): 
tl; dw: the government does not help native americans at all and the references to native americans by modern governments are only for political gain.
in addition, since this delirium started, historians have quite agreed that it is false in every way, it just caused discord and this is a point that is maintained practically only by those for whom it is politically advantageous to continue this lie.
it didn't turn out to be good and it will never turn out to be any good.
what have they changed in the message other than the wording?
i think the ch will find that questioning the legitimacy of the city under false pretenses before each game to score woke points is going to be a lot less popular in montreal than in toronto.
who, in concrete terms, among the canadians of montreal, makes the decisions on this subject
geoff molson?
before putting messages, therefore, put running water in the reserves. first thing first.
[deleted]
he shouldn't even get a message anyway
spineless. the habs folded like a cheap umbrella, gave in to political pressure from a former cop rather than talk to a historian, let alone a specialist in indigenous history
the prior message heavily implied that montreal was mohawk territory. but there isn't really any historical evidence to support mohawk control of the island at any point.
the new message emphasizes that the region was used by diverse nations (e.g. iroquoian, algonquian, and mohawk). the mohawk are singled out as having the only contemporary connection to the area.
wonder why, just read these comments... yikes.
well yeah, he was a cop. 
that goes without saying
why?
1- the mohawk are iroquoian
2- they lived on the island in the 1670s
3- there are no other competing claims to montreal
4- mohawk territory does include most of southwestern quebec
5- the hochelagans/saint lawrence iroquoians were likely related to the mohawk, far more directly than say, the french or english
guess tse
>the mohawk are iroquoian
yes ok, and?
>2- they lived on the island in the 1670s
source? and don't forget that montreal was founded in 1642
>there are no other competing claims to montreal
false, the hurons and algonquins claim that their ancestors lived on the island
>mohawk territory does include most of southwestern quebec
partially true. borders are hazy areas, it's not like now. but anyway, we are talking about the island of montreal.
>the hochelagans/saint lawrence iroquoians were likely related to the mohawk, far more directly than say, the french or english
indeed, but they were not the same nations. i can accept that the mohawks have become the representatives of the st. lawrence iroquoians, but that does not change the fact that they did not live in montreal.
to be clear, when i said iroquoians, i was referring to the st. lawrence iroquoians and not the iroquois confederacy (haudenosaunee).
> the hochelagans/saint lawrence iroquoians were likely related to the mohawk
it is widely believed that conflict with the mohawk/iroquois/haudenosaunee led to the elimination of the iroquoians. they had a similar but distinct language and culture. for any political/territorial issues, they were separate groups. it is unequivocally false to claim that the existence of 16th century iroquoian hochelaga is evidence that the island of montreal was mohawk territory at the 17th century arrival of permanent european settlers. 
overall i feel that the new statement does a better job of representing the complex (and frankly, ambiguous) history of the region while still recognizing the mohawk as the most relevant claimants.
well my first guess is that a historical fact which is unanimous disturbs your sensitivity? but i'm curious to see if there is another stronger argument
i don't know if it is widely believed or if it is one of several potential reasons for the apparent disappearance of the hochelaga.
we know they moved every 20-30 years, is it not possible they simply exhausted the soil and moved elsewhere?
my understanding is that the st lawrence iroquoians were related to the mohawk, possibly a clan within the nation or a closely related albeit somewhat culturally distinct group
it's not unanimous at all.
>my understanding is that the st lawrence iroquoians were related to the mohawk, possibly a clan within the nation or a closely related albeit somewhat culturally distinct group
your "understanding" goes against the "understanding" of the vast majority of historians and the results of exhaustive archaeological excavations if you claim they were a clan in the mohawk nation.
real pros as usual. i'm sure they've been very polite.
their incompetence would be comical if it weren't so dangerous. a bit more and they'll reach 'murica level, where a cop shot a man after mistaking a sandwich for a weapon last year.
> surrounded the pedestrian with their weapons drawn
wow! if you're close enough to be accurate with a handgun, you should be able to see the difference between a walking cane and a rifle. if you're too far to be accurate with a handgun, the gun is safer left in its holster.
seems like some dingbat (whoever placed the call) didn't know how do differenciate a cane from a rifle lol. cops get a call about a weapon and they show up all ready and realize it's a cane hahaha.
i don't know what's worse:
lethridge police stormtrooper incident or the spvm cane incident.
my dog was carrying a rifle the other day... no wait it was a stick. i know, close call right?
where's the outrage for someone who decided to call 911 for a fucking cane, though?
so a witness calls 911 to report a gun and it finds that the police should have taken their time to intervene ...
bravo!
that's a real skinny rifle!
ah yes, let's give these idiots more money 
/s
this is why i'm gonna vote for balarama.

not sure if sarcastic or genuinely happy with the police work.

so, say you see someone walking around with a rifle, how would you want the cops to react?
i should have put / s for the idiots?
🤣
the fact the cops can’t tell the difference between a rifle and a cane is pretty sad
phew, i should have gone to see your history before answering. let's see what you are going to answer now. are you going to tell me your reddit account is older than mine, or call me an idiot a second time without knowing the smallest detail about who i am.
seriously, i understand your infatuation with deliberating with strangers on reddit, but you have to understand that you don't look very good behind your keyboard.
i wish you good luck for the rest of your life, i think you are going to need it.
ps: your application for my ignored user list is approved.
i hate defending cops, but it seems like they were able to tell the difference...
now if they came guns blazing for a couple of kids fighting that would be something else, but ever since polytechnique, i'm pretty sure that if there's a suspected shooter they rush to the scene and secure the shit out of everything.
ps: i was simply asking the question my champion, nice big reaction from you. fucking snowflake
🙃
that sign post gives me anxiety
these look like jerusalem artichoke flowers! mine have been in full bloom for over a week now.
black oilseed sunflower
i'm not an flower expert, but that looks more like a yellow daisy than a sunflower.
it is the infamous parking sunflower which follows the decrees of our overlords.
old montreal, please. the old port's the other side of de la commune.
welcome to montreal, lol
oh lovely! i always associate the jerusalem artichoke with being a smaller flower head and found in massive quantities. i’ll have to look more into it.
no, that is sunflower. i grow a whole bunch of types in backyard - hard to tell which type from photo though…
there should be seeds forming inside the head of the flower - once it gets a bit colder you may be able to get a few if on public property. leave some for the birds though - winter can be long!
oh interesting! i’m no flower expert either, i’ll have to look that up! thanks
yep on the other side is the river!
groups of boys trying to project the image of gangsters.
other articles detail the mounting animosity between two groups of boys, the victim belonging to on of those groups.
both groups apparently want to be seen as "gangsters" and are ready to go to extremes to increase their "street cred"... 
this is really pathetic. maybe the cops should tour schools and show the "wannabe gangsters" uncensored images of the corpses of other dead gangsters and videos of jailed gangsters.
maybe we could salvage one or two.
this lady at the wake was saying our youth don't get opportunities...  
last time l've checked québec tuition is one of the, if not the, least expensive in north america.   
staying in school, studying, working your ass off... trying to better your community?
too difficult?  you prefer the easy money of the gang life?  i won't shed a tear when you  die.
these kids chose to be animals i grew up in the ghetto and it never made me a monster.
just saying.... 
cry me a river when you say kids don't get opportunities to he successful.
jailed gangsters? where? 
all those hells angels and mafia spent a pittance of a jail sentence actually behind bars.
most of those parents and kids don't have all that information unfortunately. yes they have access to getting that info but for "uneducated" folks, getting the info is work on it's own. 
have you been on a government website? you really gotta look and a lot of them don't read french or english that well.
a lot of them don't even know what tuition is and if they do, they don't know how to get it. 
then you have the environment you live in where people around you don't see that as a "normal " life. 
not excusing it, just not that easy to get out of a life style so easily, trust me i know lol.
yes, the asian method
[deleted]
they have the information, they choose not to use it. social pressure is a thing and when your peer group rewards violent behaviour, unless you change your peer group and environment you will not change your behaviour. i used to be in a "gang" type peer group, and anyone who had a normal life was frowned upon and outcast. when i moved towns and stopped hanging out with these people, i found financial success, started my family, and am now a respected member of the community.
are there are no longer counselors in highschools? 
as early as secondary 2 ours was always available to discuss class choices and future careers. there was tons of info at the office about cegeps and the loans and bursary system. students who were undecided got tests see what professions aligned with their interests. every year in january they started to discuss application deadlines for schools and student aid with students of the graduating class so that by late march everyone who wanted to get an education beyond highschool was just awaiting replies from those entities. younger people i know had the same experiences but none are graduating right now so have things changed completely?
>have you been on a government website? you really gotta look and a lot of them don't read french or english that well
are you seriously arguing that the biggest problem is the crappy design of quebec's govt websites? that's certainly a novel claim...
that’s a fair assessment
what do you mean by "uneducated" and what do you mean by folks?
scaring straight doesn't work.
welcome to the reality of the world that took the bus before 2010. with great luck you could catch a zealous driver yelling at the stops.
as the drivers are still humans (or at worst reptiles), one wonders, "can you tell me when we get to st-joseph?" ".
you can use your gps on google maps if it still happens
> how seriously do people manage to find their stop? i have to check out the window through the textures to see the lights that more or less correspond to my stop and hope to be right ....
like in the good old days.
the first few times you line up, you stay in constant alertness, madly scanning street signs until you feel like you're close to your corner. you get up, ready to go down, until you realize you have 2 or 3 more stops to make before you get there. you try to look like it's normal for you to get up so prematurely.
fast-forward a year doing the same trip, you get on the bus, you find a seat and you pass out instantly, the second that your behind settles on the bench and your head is held against the window, heavy of your working day. your unconscious gets on board and takes control, passively.
after a long time (which will seem like a fleeting moment to you), you wake up, firmly but not abruptly, 9.2 seconds away from your stop. you recognize yourself. you ring, you get off, and you self-pilot to your house.
it will come.
old...
this post makes me feel so old
ask the driver? he'll sure fuck you up, but it's worth a try. otherwise, transit app, i'm pretty sure it's the same voice as i often hear one after the other.
the same as when you walk without an airship telling you which street you are on.
when you walk, avoid asking a tree for directions. by bus, try the driver.
in the 18 there was a driver who sang the stops. but it's been a long time, in the snake genre the only game for a long time ...
truly ?
hahaha beautiful memories and the stress of being a teenager at night in a bus line that we do not know.
seriously, a driver should always be available to let you know when you have a stop if you ask him like a crowd. i've never had a problem this way.
sometimes the gps is simply broken on the bus and there is no other bus to replace it. or the bus that replaces it is in the garage at the other end of the driver's line, and it is not the decision to bring in his bus and take another. so unfortunately this is not possible.
google maps and transit will tell you exactly when to ring the bell. they send you a notification: the next stop is yours!
you can't really go wrong with that.
i often used my gps when it was too dark to see out the windows. it sounds silly but if you're scared you can even put your phone in navigation and it will tell you when to disembark.
google maps
> welcome to the reality of the world that took the bus before 2010.
2010? it was like that until the end of 2017!
> welcome to the reality of the world that took the bus before 2010
especially at the end of winter with all the windows covered in mud and the montreal signs written in size 4 font hanging only on a street corner
or the transit application which does a very good job. you can even see your bus while you wait for it.
indeed, you don't even need cellular data to do that on top of that.
tell me you're a millennial without telling me you're a millennial
i have often asked and the drivers have always done it without problem. i've always asked politely, that's the difference.
> holness had never met the pair and admits communication with his new political bedmates from ralliement is somewhat strained.
> he indicated that he and his team are barely in touch with those who joined movement montreal as ralliement candidates.
> “i just hope they are doing what they need to do to get elected, including going door to door campaigning.”
we see how seriously he takes it lol
i'm starting to believe that ralliement pour montréal has joined this party only to harm it
ya love to see it folks!
fyi, these are two new candidates, so we are down to 6 candidates i believe?
and they just keep dropping
that party seems a bit too thrown together at the last minute. maybe next time around they will have their shit together and present a viable  alternative.
lol
still the best party option out there.
politics is really intriguing
not with hollness that's for sure.
somebody with his charisma but without his ego perhaps.
he has no charisma. did you hear him interview?
and less divise ideas about language.
success in sport = / = charisma or political talent
it helps people know your name because you're in the most read section of jdm. but above all it takes leadership, listening, patience ... things that he visibly lacks.

i mean, the hesitancy there is quite understandable.
this example of someone losing a daughter to a vaccine is salient and all, but it’s is not the norm for the holdouts.  many of them at this point are are ignorant and arrogant clowns and i’m not going to treat them like a five year old, hoping they’ll do the right thing. that ship has sailed. the best way to get the majority of these leftovers vaxxed is to make their lives a series of hoops and closed doors by way of vaccine passports. enough is enough.
"i'm not anti-vaccine. i'm in favour of the vaccine for everyone else — just not me."
mixed in with a bit of pure selfishness. 
i understand how she'd be terrified of doing it but the above statement is saying "i know vaccines work but i'll just let everybody else take the risks involved while i also benefit from herd immunity".
do not.
what about will prosper?

although the project is not perfect, i like the fact that the caisse is aggressive with its schedule. if we try to please everyone we will end up with 40 years of promises as for the blue line.
we haven't even started the consultations yet. it is necessary to have a project which has the support of the population, it seems to me, and to avoid the lukewarm reception of the first rem.
the only principle of "la caisse" is that no one gets blamed if it messes up right?
i think there is a way to combine the effectiveness of the caisse and sustainable development.
apparently,  it's everybody's fault but that of the killer

if there are any interested, there will be a peaceful march in tribute to romane and to protest against domestic violence. it's this saturday, it starts at 12:30 p.m. and the starting point is at the face sur université school (between sherbrooke and milton).
no one, absolutely no one is saying that he should be let out because he is pitiful. but the cousin makes a point: it would probably have been different if we had had better social support and a better investment in mental disorders.
at first glance, the most conservative values estimate that around 15 percent of people in quebec are diagnosed with a mental disorder. the average value appears to be one in five.
when one-fifth of your population suffers from various mental disorders, maybe you should start thinking about it.
and the pandemic has certainly made matters worse.
we've never heard so much of things like "health is also mental health, it's important, you have to talk about it, no shame in being blah blah blah". ironically, mental health care is more inaccessible and expensive than ever.
and it is impossible to obtain consultation with a psychologist in the public system in quebec. really pathetic.
i think they are betting that 98% of the people will be honest and the profits will be there despite a certain amount of theft.
there is no cash on site so it becomes less interesting to steal a case of doritos and mountain dew.
right, you just have to wait for a door to open and then you come back calmly. you don't even need to put on a ski mask, tlm already wears masks but you have to leave your cell at home on the other hand ... very feasible but will put a security officer there i imagine
man, if the homeless swarm concordia's buildings when they are empty, can you imagine how many homeless will live in a clean area filled with food?
in the netherlands there are plenty of automated "convenience stores" which are actually huge vending machines that even serve [hot meals] ( i always wondered why we didn't have this here.
there is nothing that prevents people from doing the same in a conventional convenience store. the employee is not supposed to confront thieves or robbers.
i had heard of an amazon store in new york where there were no cashiers or even a self-service checkout. somehow what you took was scanned and uploaded directly to your account. i imagine that's not what they're going to do at this convenience store, but it's not far.
question not related:
do the police check that simple shoplifting?
the last 3 times we went to bed late, the line was long, the guy at the cash register was checking fuckall, the world behind me just left with their stock, and nothing happened
like you are the norm
there are a lot of convenience stores without employees. often an owner couple who work 12 hours a day.
there are “self-checkout” boxes everywhere now, it's not that big a leap ...
you're telling me that a soulless torontonian neighborhood wants to have even less human interaction? lololol
griffentown is such shit
i thought we were still years away  but really this is the first solid link in a chain that will change the way society works. im not saying this is bad or good, but eventually more and more places will adopt this mode if it is successful. this means that stores will have less employees but still take up the same space and community requirements. what are people supposed to do when there literally is no where left to work, at least the low skill jobs which are thr majority.
at some point in time cars will drive themselves and delivery trucks will drive without drivers, taxis will have no drivers, small items delivered my drone. the number of available places to work will drop and drop as we head towards the future...
the interesting thing is that eventually we will ask the question why are there people who have nothing, when society is so productive. you replace say 1/3 of the population with automation and do they just get fucked? 
these types of stores are incompatible with the way our societies currently work and i'm interested to see what solutions this problem we come up with.
.
i don't know what percentage of the population has a smartphone, but i'm not one of them. i hope this kind of thing will never be spread too much. wild capitalism.
in more isolated areas there are service stations without employees for gasoline. even if you already have to pay at the pump before refueling, there is still an employee in an office elsewhere 24/7 who watches the security camera feeds and authorizes the pumps.
if the company's convenience stores are robbed, it's not complicated to have an employee looking at the cameras of 5-10 convenience stores and unlocking the door remotely. so no way out of the room if you have stolen / not paid for everything you have taken. in case of emergency (fire, etc.) you can set that when someone tries to open the door it automatically starts after 15 seconds unless the employee watching the cameras override.
it's not more advantageous if you have to pay a garda agent $ 20 an hour instead of a $ 13 clerk ...
not going to put that in montreal north or lachine ... it's not for nothing that they chose griffin town lol
you open the door with your cell, they'll find out who you are.
seen in the email i received: the second door unlocks automatically once the first door is closed.
so there are 2 doors to prevent people from sneaking in, a bit like in a jewelry store i imagine.
you have to scan something to enter. im guessing some sort of barrier to prevent what you described from happening
in asia too.
there are some elsewhere in europe as well. the food isn't great, but it's cheap and it clogs a corner.
>turkey (the country most of you make fun of)
we do?
just watched your profile because i felt a narcissist vibe, you called americans dumb fag****, and also you're denying armenian genocide. 🤡
welcome to montreal!
concerning your second point, i must disagree. the strength of canada’s banking system rests in how rigourous its standards are. opening an account might be more of a hassle, but i’d trade that for a reliable banking system any day of the week.
it’s no coincidence that our banks made it out of the 2008 financial crisis (relatively) without a scratch — canada has an extremely tightly regulated banking system. it’s a feature, not a flaw.
for your first point, i don't believe that ghosting is part of the culture, but we are not the most direct people and in general we do not like confrontation. i recommend reading dany laferrière's "tout ce que nous ne sais pas mongo" to understand certain aspects of the local culture.
regarding the banks, maybe it's a bad branch? it seems to me that it is not usually that long. try elsewhere.
3- it's north america. our public transit is very good for north america.
4 - ouep
5 - this is a problem. much less worse for engineers than for some other professions. at least for engineers it is achievable (although it takes time and effort).
6 - you will get used to it.
welcome! it must be difficult to immigrate in times of pandemic.

welcome to montreal!
canada's banking system is one of the best, if not the best, in the world.  
[
you are arriving in the country with no credit history.  yes, financial matters will be less efficient for you until you establish credit and residence.  however, once you do, it does get simpler and more efficient.
there are things like paying bills that are not as easy as in europe, and it can seem antiquated seeing people still use cheques for certain things, but things will get better for you with time here.
bienvenue à montréal! be prepared for much higher electricity bills in the winter! my advise is to dress warmly in your house and never heat at more than  21c or else, you'll have a very bad surprise later on!
4: telecom monopoly/lobby runs canada
i have been living in montreal for more than 10 years and still don’t get used to the ghosting thing… you interact with a contractor, or anyone that is supposed to reach back for an estimate or anything and after a few interactions they just don’t show up when they were expected to and then don’t answer messages anymore…
so far, it looks like you have not experienced our worst yet: our awful health system. i really hope you don't need to any time soon.
lol you think montréalais think turks and arabs are the same? or we make fun of turkey often?
baby i'm not arab or turkish at all and still i pick up arabic and turkish slang/ knowledge from osmosis.
maybe people ghosted you because you have a chip on your shoulder? or you're the type to nationalistically brag about banking systems lol...
what a way to introduce yourself to others...
hey, i work at a bank in montreal and while you do mostly need an appointment, if someone is free at the time they should be able to take you no matter the bank. the mandatory appointment rule could very well be because of covid, but the length of everything else does just sound like some bad luck, definitely a mishandled situation. depending on the institution you’re with, and even the specific branch you go to, your service should be a1
as for the cell phone rates, do not go with bell, rogers or telus unless you want to spend a ton of money. same with your internet for bell. i recommend fizz for internet, cheaper packages and your leftover data at the end of the month rolls over which is a nice perk. only catch is you need to bring your own phone, but overall it’s a lot cheaper than going with one of the companies. concerning the internet, i hear virgin offers pretty decent internet service for about $50 a month.
interesting post, thanks for taking the time to write it. i immigrated from the us 20 years ago, (and l also ived in italy for a little while) and agree with all your points.  the thing that still amazes me is how bad the traffic planning and road signs and road quality is here. if you live in the city proper i would recommend avoiding driving or owning a car if you at all can, and go metro + car sharing even though it can be expensive.
also, in terms of tips, put yourself on a list now when you likely don't need it, for a family doctor. it will take a while but down the road you may find it useful to have one you can have a relationship with.  
also, if you can make a plan or two to get out of the city and see the regions or do some outdoors stuff especially in winter. there's a montreal outdoors club which does regular hiking trips and activities in a group and is very friendly bilingual and affordable. 
generally the people are great here and make up for a lot of the inanities. it's interesting how blind we humans are (in almost all countries) to how things could be done better.
i’ve been to turkey, hoşgeldiniz. things are much different here. in regards to your complaints, there are improvements needed in the recognition of overseas schooling/training. there are doctors from other countries that come here who are not recognized as doctors, we have a large shortage of them across the provinces(nurses too). this must be a key frustration point for many who immigrate here. loved staying in turkey, everyone i met was incredibly gracious and generous. so teşekkürler, canada is happy to have you here!
on the banking system: i agree with what others here have said. aml/kyc (anti-money laundering/know your customer) is a huge part of what keeps our bank's credit ratings so high; integrity is a large part of canadian culture. meanwhile, turkey allows stuff like [this](
on the telecoms: i'm not defending them by any means; it is an oligopoly and they weild way too much power over our country. that being said, we are the second largest country by area. it is very costly to install infrastructure because of just how far apart everything is. i for sure think the government could do something to encourage competition in the industry, however. but frankly, at least quebec has videotron... you should see the pricing in ontario where it's just rogers, bell, and telus.
on your degree: i know it sucks to hear, and likely you are a very qualified engineer! but imagine we just accepted engineers from anywhere. we might end up with buildings like the one in florida that collapsed this summer, and that's a big risk to our population! canada doesn't have the resources to vet each and every university across the entire world. i imagine it's easier if you are in the eu, but unfortunately turkey isn't and has not lately been making too much effort to achieve that goal it used to have.
i used to work with someone who had received an architecture degree from egypt. they came over here and were doing apprenticeship to get their license but ended up getting fired by their employer for an expensive mistake they made on the beams in the ceiling. while it is devastating for them and their career, and i do feel bad for them, i am glad the system protected us from a potential disaster.
good luck on your wife's visa and welcome to canada. :)
for the engineering degree thing, you might be able to get your degrees recognized if you can validate that the schools at which they were completed are "legit." you will likely still have to do the licensing exam which relates to ethics/law in canada regardless, as do engineers educated in canada.
my understanding is that there is a running list of schools that will be considered valid for the purposes of obtaining your peng, but that it may be missing some institutions because well, the world is big and there are a lot of universities. i'm not sure of the precise process, but i had a roommate who had to do this because for whatever reason his university (in germany) was not on "the list." i'm not sure what processes were involved here, but i think he basically had to submit detailed transcripts/course descriptions to prove that what he'd done was equivalent to a canadian university engineering degree in terms of content.
it's a bit complicated though and depends on the rules where you're from as well... my understanding is that if you've done your degrees in a foreign country, it's only peng admissible if you've done all the steps to qualify to be a peng/equivalent in that country. so for example, someone who has done their engineering degrees in the us must also pass the us professional exam, which evaluates engineering core content - the degree alone is not enough because in the us the degree + content exam = professional engineer. the us got mad at some point about this (canadian licensing exam is just ethics and "easy"), but we did a study that showed that that almost all canadian engineering grads could pass the us exam on the first try ;).
welcome in north-america! yes you need an appointement for everything. usualy opening a bank account take 15-30min and receive a credit card take 2 days. don’t go to desjardins!
i arrive not so long and i totally agree with be banking stuff, the call center is so bad that one time it was easier for me to just go there
if you find montreal's public transit bad and expensive wait until you try the ttc. stm is one of the better systems.
quite the passive aggressive rant...
another adjustable story with body cameras for police officers
i work in banking and i guarantee clients say worse things to me all the time... but i don't get bent out of shape, track them down, and bust into their home like the kool-ade man to whup their asses. the "thin blue line" should be renamed to the "thin-skinned blue line".
all i know is what's in the article. but i do know something else... i live across the street from an expensive, and very big, daycare center, and some parents simply don't give a shit about parking rules because "it's only 2 minutes". my driveway is always blocked by some entitled asshole. i've tried telling them nicely, they don't care. i tried telling them a little more forcefully, they get even more mad at me. i've tried talking to the daycare administration, they act all apologetic but nothing happens.
coincidentally, this morning it happened again and i called the city to tow or at least ticket their asses. i've spoken to my neighbors and we all have the same problem. it's a one lane, one way street, with a bike path. the chaos at 3 p.m. is ridiculous.
to reiterate, these people dropping off their kids do not care at all. that being said, to have police enter your house and tackle you over a parking fine is beyond ridiculous as well, but the way humans are in general, both civilian and law enforcement, it doesn't surprise me that a situation would degenerate to this point.
this is what happens when cops are untouchable in montreal. is the guy a jerk? yes but those public security officers are asshats as well. this is precisely why you need security cameras to a cloud in and outside of your home
who cares he's a doctor? is it to give it credibility?
obstruction of justice. nothing more than a bullsh*t power trip tactic on the part of police to charge/arrest anyone who dares to argue with or question them.
it's fine, we have 7 cops walking the streets to connect with people on some pilot that's going to be cancelled next year. we're good here.
i don't understand the psychology here: they're acting all tough beating up people for no reason, but at the same time they're little pussies who feel "threatened" by any random word or "fear for their life" when a scrawny unarmed homeless person charges at them.
does anyone here really believe that the police attended the man's house three hours after the altercation with a security guard just because he said "go ahead" when threatened to tow him? come on. the police are not saints, far from it, especially those of montreal. but the security guard's version is clearly missing here. he certainly said something less harmless than "go ahead" to get the police to show up at his house.
technical question, are town of mount royal public security officers of the peace?
acab here, acab everywhere. 
give angry and violent men weapons and power, and let them handle minor altercations, good idea… /s
devastating trauma for the cops, better give them another 300 million $ for some reason
winning point for the candidates .. fucking bodycams, now!
acab
woa did he really dare the police?
the guys was a dick to the security guard no doubt but the security guard and the police overreacted in a criminal manner.  disgraceful.
acab
i would so like to know if it was perfectly free, or if it was after the police asked him 150 times to do something or if it is somewhere in between?
strongly bodycams !!
a crime is a crime. 
i think he should be at least sentenced to three years of labor concentration camp in yukon. 
then after his last supper, he can choose between lethal injection, electrocution, lethal gas, firing squad, or hanging
these cops are a great example of the acab syndrome
damn, that website on mobile sucks. can't have the page centered for some reason.

> although quebec’s comments do not come as a 
surprise, the mck is repulsed by quebec’s attempt to politicize a 
genuine reconciliatory action on the part of a sports club
shots fired
i would like to know the opinion of the algonquins on the subject.
if they changed mohawk to iroquoians, it might be satisfying for pretty much everyone.
they need public relations advice.
"'serve as an example of true reconciliation between canadians and indigenous peoples"
"the mck believes in working collaboratively "
"true reconciliation can only occur when both parties are willing to create an open dialogue"
"working collaboratively is the only way to establish goodwill"
i would like to know what they (the mohawk council of kahnawake) claim to do on their side as a 'collaborative' and 'reconciliatory' effort. it always seemed really one-sided to me.
nationalists and using technicalities to deny native heritage because they can't share their victim complex with anyone else, name a more iconic duo.
i mean, aren’t those statements largely used for political purposes? you saw the mohawk mother’s group use the exact same statements this week to claim ownership of the royal vic site.
so are we going to have a more precise idea of our history by being more vague?
if something happened in reunion island, or in martinique, is it sufficient to say that it happened in france?
what makes you say that?
are they guilty of colonization now?
this is a typping error. they meant claims.
……… .. they are not the colonizers… ..
being english and giving more credence to skin color than historical facts
"""progressive""" liberals being unable to differentiate minorities beyond physical appearances.
natives historically lived here for hundreds of years. they're not mohawks however. the mohawk leaders in québec do claim they're the ones who killed the iroquois du st-laurent however, granting them montréal by right of conquest.
iroquois are distinct from iroquois.
well for one the press release isn't the most professional.  they accuse the government of saying things but make a vague reference to articles in the media. they criticize the government for using the media to debate but they're doing so in a press release.   they put the full statement from the canadiens in the second paragraph when that should probably be in appendix or have the relevant bit summarized in one sentence. there are some usage errors - eg respectively when they mean respectfully. 
granted they're basically a community group and not swimming in tax revenue and presumably english is their second or third language. yet it's a press release and public relations they're engaged in.
i'm not a pr professional but that's what jumps out at me first.
be careful, if we can 'accuse' the quebec government today of 'colonization' for acts of several centuries ago, we can accuse the mohawk council of many genocides for the same period, as long as you know your background. story.
but your reaction shows clearly that there is no question of "reconciliation".
the mohawks do not come from montreal, they come from the american side. their "claim" on montreal comes from the fact that they would have killed the inhabitants of hochelaga between the visit of jacques cartiers in 1535 and that of champlain in 1603. so it belongs to them according to them. the wicked colonizers settled here peacefully to trade in fur with the natives.
no one in canada has colonized the mohawks either in the present or in the past. now it is this advice which itself pardons gestures ** on both sides **, so i would like to know what they intend to do on their side to "reconcile".
that's inaccurate. mohawk territory has always included southwestern quebec. the hochelagans were likely a clan within the mohawk nation whose society/economy was more focused on trade with the huron and algonquin than other iroquois peoples/nations.
while shopping i've been hearing a lot of depanneur and small business owners whinging about "la pcu la pcu" and how they have trouble finding staff.
when your wages are so low that they are competing with a bare-minimum emergency benefit due to a global disaster, maybe there's an issue there. 
covid provided an opportunity for a lot of service workers to take stock of how little their employers care about them and how bad the workplace environment is. how bad the job security is. how they show up for a 6-hour dinner server shift and get cut early that evening due to lack of customers.
many people took this opportunity to say "fuck that" and i commend them.
a job requires two parties to come to an employment agreement. a lot of employers are feeling the heat now that the employees have some bargaining power and employers can't just dictate all the terms of even entry-level work.
it's crazy how this pandemic has blatantly brought to light several social problems that were there long before it struck ... especially concerning working conditions in the field of health and catering.
i was a full time barista in 2010-2011.
i would never resume this kind of work. it was honestly the most difficult job of my life, mentally and physically. the stress was appalling.
even jobs that aren’t minimum wage are actually minimum wage when you look into them. for example, jobs teaching english as a second language are advertised at $18 to $25/hr in the city. but they only pay for in-class time and not for prep work, corrections, etc so really you’re making near or below the minimum wage. how is this sort of thing tolerated? it’s not like it just started happening. wage theft, is what it is.
i dunno if you done that already, but there is a channel named antiwork on reddit. you may want to vent a lot there, its very, very usefull.
this just in! water is wet. more breaking news at 6!
high expectations can be a bitch
yeah, the owner of the restaurant in my building is complaining that he can't find staff to work, and how he's had to resort to working 6 days a week in the kitchen.  but he drives to work every day in a cadillac.  
i'm willing to bet that wages are a small fraction of his operating costs, and that he could easily afford to increase the hourly wages by 50% or more.
the last 18 months have been tough, but he was collecting support cheques from the government the whole time as well.  there also hasn't been any marketing being done to notify folks in the area that they've re-opened with their full menu, and the patio was re-opened...  so, there's a lot of blame to go around...
it's easy to say "fuck" that when you make others bear the consequences of this choice ...
i think that the world are so exhausted of the covid that before, he could "endure 'a job of shit for reason x or reason y, but that after 2 in this shit show, we just can't go back in these conditions anymore. and the boss fuckers think they can just put back the salary from before, put in a little bonus of $ 1 an hour and everyone's gonna run to them for the job.
ditto for the waitress job. deal with a large family with young children = a nightmare.
well yes you have a job whose positive impact is significant and whose working conditions allow you to have a comfortable and fun lifestyle, what high expectations!
business owners have a responsibility to manage their finances and set a salary that attracts adequate staff while being able to afford the cost of products and overhead. that's it, that's all.
their budget is not my problem.
> have a job with a significant positive impact and whose working conditions allow you to have a comfortable lifestyle
she's a student with a student job there. if student jobs ticked all the boxes, who would bother to have a career?
i agree, and in the same way, it is the responsibility of the workers to work to the best of their ability if they want a livelihood. in short, work or not, but don't ask the rest of society to pay for nothing to do when there is work. because if you haven't noticed, we are already paying for all the consequences of pku / pcre, and it's not over.
the idea is not to tick all the boxes, but that the result is not a net negative on physical and mental health vs salary. it's not _so_ so difficult to provide good working conditions, it's just not an expense that employers want to incur.
tour guides and many self-employed workers need these programs
loose with the truth is a long euphemism for liar. why is the cbc mincing words?
we care, we just dont talk about it cause we're used to him lying. c'est pas nouveau.
*loose* with the truth? now that is a lie! 😅 he blantly lies all the time!!!
i for one care and i'll make sure not to vote for his lying ass.
his electors don't care, they believe that he's going to get rid each every bike path i'm the city so they will be able to get parking right in front of their condo or retirement home and that is all they really care about.
the mother of all euphemisms there. jesus....
"loose with the truth"
interesting way to say to say pathological liar
no
anyone but plante. old people know not to vote for her and guess who votes in elections, especially municipal elections?
strong liberal bias
is he not a new man? with beautiful values like transparency?
/ s just in case
cbc is anti-liberal but very pro liberal
allegedly
penn and teller fool us on yootoob is no worse for those who want to see those who survived.
and that is stuff you should know!
wow, first william shatner mtl homeboy goes to space, and now this. i'm just researching all these things while i happen to be here for a few days. this is interesting, i didn't know this happened in montreal. as it turns out, i'm a martial artist who is quite interested in the physical principles behind sustaining blows and generating forces internally, and it's completely possible, you sort of learn how to use your breath to create extra forces within your muscle tissue and this is part of what i think something like what houdini could do, i'm sure, as a person who was interested actually in mastering his own body and mind (something david blaine took up and to the next level, i think), but if you don't have time to do it and prepare in the right moment, then it won't be of much use. it always sounds like the guy that did it was either an ass or misunderstood this and thought houdini was claiming to be some magical being that could absorb any force at any moment, which is not the case if you're not prepared for it, no matter how good you are at it.
penn and teller fool us is a very good show, period. good suggestion
yeah. there were some pretty mind-blowing magicians on the show.

he wont spend too too long in jail. maybe 10-15 years. he'll be out before 30.
depending how many years he gets, he'll go to a juvenile detention center until 18yo. then, depending on behavior, the judge could agree that he stays there until he's 21 (max) and thus avoid going to jail at all.
our justice system is extremely lenient toward minors.
you can also vote on the 30th and 31st october.
im predicting 40-45% turn out over two days
i have always voted, but i never had the taste to stay with us as much as for this one.
sure!
i’ve noticed that since plante took office, the road quality has improved — new pavement that’s been put down stays down, doesn’t crumble to shit within a year. that little observation indicates to me that the shameless grift and wholesale thievery (and presumably the endemic corruption) within the municipal govt has been stemmed. for that alone they got my vote. went out of my way to get registered, that lying fat fuck coderre isn’t getting back in.
i will vote on october 30
all those who say that if we don't vote, we don't cry and that voting is a citizen's duty, then do what you think and vote.
otherwise, it is dishonest.
what do we do if we are not satisfied with any of the candidates? i am against the philosophy of “voting for the least worst”, since that is the reason why our political class is so shitty. a blank vote that will simply be discarded without being counted?
even if i vote for dollarama lochness?
are there debates readily available to keep me informed? i want to go and vote but i have absolutely no knowledge of municipal politics!
i lol'd at real democracy.
hmm, how do we get to vote? are we supposed to have received a small box?
yes, go vote for the next mayor of montreal, may the best win.
i will not be in montreal on november 7th :(
plante has done quite a few skateboard trails and refurbished parks on my side of the island. it will also open the shore to the east for swimming this summer. we think we vote for her because it helps children to exercise.
me, i don't like to vote.
\ -the grumpy smurf
isn't that holness dude running on sjw identity politics platform? i nearly threw up when i read that. that's gonna go well for him.
how do i vote? born and raised in this city, do 8 just walk in to an office somewhere and cast a ballot?
given that all the candidates suck nuts i’ll pass.
"true democracy" come back to learn what it is and come back to tell me in the eyes that your once a year for a person is democracy ... fool
not one person at my door, no issue i care about, can i vote to burn the olympic stadium down through an act of terrorism and every montrealer collects a cut of the insurance money?
i don't really understand the underlying statement here. what does it have to do with the tragedy?  
what would it have changed if she was in a professional setback or failing at school?
horrible story.

socially, it's an expression of grief... acknowledging the magnitude of the loss helps recover from the loss.
now is it *news* ? no.
i'm with you. it sounds like "people die all the time and i don't give a shit, but this one was important".
it's like when they say "beautiful young woman" etc. 
fine, but would her death be any less tragic if she was homely?
classic victim blaming.
he was her roommate…should she have thought twice about not being able to afford housing without roomies?
>socially, it's an expression of grief... acknowledging the magnitude of the loss helps recover from the loss.
that's an interesting aspect i've not thought about (i don't think it works the same for me).  
thanks
does it get clicks? yes. so it is news.
classic no accountability
really? how about seeing it as self-defense or victim prevention?
if i blamed her i'd say, "it was her fault".
if it's offensive to say that we should be smarter and more careful, that's even more insulting.
this person is arguing against the death penalty in america for a mass shooting event. troll much?
i guess pornhub is a news site then.
like how dare we suggest that we can be smarter and have better self esteem to avoid shit like this in the future!  it's so much better for women to be victims!
victim blaming is wrong, but so is being a victim.
and? what of it? being against the death penalty isn't the same as promoting wanton acts of violence.
i really believe they should diversify a bit and combine porn and news. people would be way better informed.
classic classic
you litterally just said being a victim is wrong. this is textbook victim blaming.
yeah just try not getting stabbed next time, so easy not to get stabbed....
private clinic at $ 300 is the right answer, go ahead?
newcomers must purchase private insurance for the 3-month period during which they are not covered by the public plan, or pay medical expenses out of pocket.
call 811 - they'll be able to orient you. you may have to wait a long time on the phone but at least you will be talking to a person and not a computer.
if you are a refugee, your iuc number allows the doctor to be paid via the blue cross insurance. otherwise you will have to pay $ 300
try the med cloud clinic. it costs around $ 150 but i think you can make an appointment without a ramq card
private clinic at <$ 150. there are a lot of them. mine is $ 145 for non-members, rv the next day (south shore on the other hand)
some private insurance will even pay for it (like that of my foreign student friend).
it depends on the nature of the consultation.
beyond having the health insurance card, there is also the question of having a family doctor.
if it's about treatment or anything that needs follow-up, you might just have waited for your appointment and showed up for nothing.
after wasting almost a month going to three walk-in clinic appointments (about which i was misinformed over the phone), i fell in love and went private for $ 320. i was able to pick up my medication the same day ...
otherwise it is common to go to the emergency room for something not urgent, precisely for this reason.
as far as i remember, the diamond clinic at côte des neiges takes patients without ramq, you obviously pay but it's not an exorbitant price. to see if the private is cheaper or the same price because the public, and especially this clinic, it is ultra long and not super fun
maybe see with 
queen elizabeth emergency clinic is $ 50 if ever
to the vet? 🤔
without ramq (or other insurance) the emergency will cost much more than a clinic, however.
it's just...
im just so tired, any one else?
just feels like i've been tired for 2 years +, its the constant stress for covid, work, and family i guess. just feels like a never ending day. 
every time i get a sniffle, oh it must be covid but i haven't seen any one in days so how could i catch covid? keep hearing how oh theirs no common cold well what about just a leaky nose from sitting out side...
just rambling, winter blues and more cold weather to come makes me not want to live in canada any more.
friday is ravioli.
crazy week. my guy brought back a virus from the daycare, it looked like gastro without the diarrhea but kept throwing up (good appetite). fortunately it only lasted for an afternoon. my baby got this virus yesterday. same case. and me too. tabarnak!
i take this opportunity to ask you a little help for my youtube channel on montreal.
i'm starting to run out of interesting topics .... do you know any buildings, attractions that could be the subject of a 10 minute video?
it's been 2 months i went to the gym and i am stronglifts 5x5 ft there i start to be mixed on which program to follow when i put my maximum on my lifts, which is coming very quickly. i look at the recommended programs on / r / fitness pi i understand fuck all. is the fun stronglifts for the fact that it is as easy as pie even to the point of being too simple.
the city taped flyers to our doors last spring telling everyone on my street that the street cleaning parking signs would not be enforced this year due to construction. yesterday was they day that they decided to give everyone a ticket for not following the parking signs.
column from a high school teacher: it's graduating photo day today for high school 5. it really makes it real that it's their last year in high school. i have to push the teachers who teach graduates to also take a photo to be on the mosaic with the students.
i spent this week seeing an after school basketball practice. the young people looked extremely happy to be there after a year and a half without organized sport at school. we have several for whom it is one of the only pleasures that keeps them at school. i'm already looking forward to the first inter-school matches!
well, it took about 4 months, but i finally got a handyman in to fix my ceiling post water leak, hurrah!
on the downside, that dude did a real ugly job of the patch. win some and lose some, eh?
thinking about leaving the country for 1 or 2 months this winter. just wondering, what temperature should i leave the thermostat set at in an empty apartment? trying to find the balance between "not going too low as to cause damage to things inside" and "not paying a ton of money to heat an empty place"
do you take vit d ? it helps some people a lot.
"i'm just so tired" dude we all are, i feel you. there's this mushy grey cloud hanging over us that seems like it's never going to go away. 
the best we can do is try to find peace and harmony where we can, and where we can. be good, stay safe and mentally we should all take time for ourselves - somehow, someway.
sorry for all of you.
gastro viruses are the worst with children. it is almost impossible that it does not spread to the entire household.
the worst part is picking up all this mess when your own stomach is on the edge of your lips.
no suggestion, but a little message to thank you. i like your capsules on montreal.
did you talk about the saga of the chinese hospital in st-denis?
i ran into a guy on a construction site in vancouver who couldn't believe the quality of the work in montreal cathedrals (they didn't have computers or power tools !!). i explained to him that a monument to god involves a lot more investment than concrete, drywall and glass condos built to make money. there is beautiful architecture and really solid craftsmanship in our churches.
you can speak in general about the sisters of notre-dame who were the first to educate girls in quebec, many schools still depend on them in a more distant way of course.
did you talk about griffintwn and gentrification? or the osler museum of medicine or is there something a little creepy, with the redpath museum?
i progressed to * 5/3/1 for beginners * after sl and this was most recommended on the sub at the time; i really liked it.
it's a nice continuity, enough base for the main lifts, with more latitude on the accessories. there is also an excel template to help you set up your loads at the start ... and it helps a lot to understand because the description is a bit confusing! i've always allowed myself to skip a few warm-up sets because it was huge, but at your leisure.
you can stay on that for a solid 6 months - 1 year while continuing to improve in my opinion.
keep the flyer and dispute the ticket
are photography studios still so bandit? when my kids were in elementary and secondary school it cost us a piece of butter every year for the photos. in recent years, if my kids didn't want them, we only took the group photo.
today, with the quality of the cell photos, i really don't see the appeal of school photos (other than the group photo).
like graduates next spring?
i once had an apartment where the previous occupant wanted a flat screen tv but couldn't afford one so he cut out a hole in the wall and just put his tv there. he "patched" it up before leaving but did a horrible job.
1 877-644-4545 star option, option number 3
it's old 811. they're gonna find you an appointment at a clinic.
[deleted]
if i can give you any advice, it's to call the clinics around you and canvass them yourself, that's how i found a clinic that was going to have a new doctor soon.
on this site: 
i put my postal code, a radius of 5km and i called the clinics one after the other. it takes a little while, but i don't believe in registering at the waiting desk at all.
regular checkups? haha, no. when i am sick i take 2 advil and i cross my fingers. make yourself healthy qc does not give me a dream. not yet tried hello health. i don't really have time for all of this, because my daughter and my wife go first.
as far as i am concerned, i only consult when i am traveling abroad. never in qc.
who told you it wasn't an emergency? the triage nurse? 🤨
i payed 140 the visit to the private md to get prescriptions for the tests / treatment that i need and i bring it to the clsc / clinic which offers them. it's not fast or free but it's all i can do tbk
do your parents / spouse / children have a doc? you can ask to have the same.
i find the system as such not to be that bad. i had knee surgery in may and the operation went well and the follow-up too (pierre boucher hospital).
for me, the main problem is the lack of a family doctor. it's too hard to find one and therefore to be able to access care. the mafia of the order of physicians has something to do with it: when you see everything they ask of foreign doctors who want to come here, it's absurd.
like this a french or moroccan doctor would be worth less than a quebec doctor. it is a shame because it would make it possible to have more doctors.
there should also be more small practices where doctors work all week. too many doctors roam between several clinics and it is often difficult to get an appointment quickly.
you are not the only one going through this. the best is to reassess on the online sites of rv (that of qc and bonjour santé). that's what i did and i finally found an appointment (at 6 am in the morning in front of my computer on the rvsq site). courage!
i use bonjour sante
> i'm afraid of having children in this rotten system!
you will be able to discover the joy of paying for the cpe system with your taxes while being forced to pay $ 1000 per month to the private sector because there is no place in cpe!
me too i got a family doctor pretty quickly. i have been in montreal for 4 years and it's been just before the covid that i had the call to confirm and have my first appointment. no condition. my boyfriend too it took him about two years.
we are both in the western ciusss of the island on the other hand. it seems that people in other sectors have more trouble finding it but in verdun / dorval / lachine / ville emard it seems that things are going quite well 🤔
the trick for rvsq is to press the search button at 3:00 p.m. sharp because it's time to open up. be careful, it goes like 1 minute.
in my opinion, the problem is not the recognition of diplomas outside quebec. when accepted, a physician receives a ramq billing number. if quebec accepted all doctors from outside quebec and gave them a billing number, the health budget would explode. therefore, limiting the issuance of these numbers is a way of rationing the health care supply. there are 2 ways to ration the supply, either by reducing the number of doctors or by money (privatization). in both cases, people will suffer, but not for the same reasons. the state could do better but we are ruled (western world) by people who just want to be re-elected at any cost. knowing this, the profiteers (not just the private, all profiteers) use this weakness of our "zealots" to pump the system. an example: i saw a position posted in a ciuss which offers 6 weeks of vacation with 13 days of statutory holiday. one of the main tasks is to ensure the productivity of the service. and then, we are surprised that it is expensive and that it works badly.
weird, it's been just 4-5 years since i moved to montreal and it took me like a year and a half to get a family doctor. there are always appointments next week or the other ... for the samples, my doctor tells me where to go and usually no appointment required, never really busy at the clsc metro or others.
when i was in quebec, i used bonjour santé and it was free, you just had to make an appointment at 8 p.m. sharp to get a place the next day.
not the best, but i never really had a problem getting access to the services i needed.
am i the only one who stayed on the tax 40k a year?
gatineau says hi
i have a family doctor. it makes life 15x easier. before that, i went to the clinic without an appointment but it also took a few hours and you have to go early in the morning.
have you checked on the ticket office site if there is really a request for your name? 10 years seems too long to me.
otherwise for the rest:
rvsq, the appointments appear the day before around 12-13h and fill up * quickly *. you won't find anything if you search too early or too late. if it is really urgent, call 811 and they will transfer you to the ciusss appointment center. they always have extra seats.
sleep studies, call either a hospital or a sleep clinic. it doesn't happen at the doctor's office.
for samples, clic-santé manages this during the pandemic. before, you could just come to the hospital and it took 20min max.
i admit it takes a bit of your own but at some point you have to at least know where to go before complaining.
it would be worth studying the phenomenon. okay with your data, but family doctors would see all cases that never make it to the emergency room. i started from this idea. to be continued.
i don't know how you do it ...
i just looked, i found ** several ** appointments, in a clsc, for blood tests, in less than two weeks, without having to call anywhere. [ marge(
last year, i was worried about having a broken foot, i called health info, the same evening a doctor called me at home and sent me my paper for an x-ray, i had an appointment. you the next day.
for a doctor, when i moved to montreal, i was on the waiting list. i had a new doctor in 14 months.
when i had to see an allergist, i waited 7 months and got my appointment.
at some point you have to know how to manage too ... if your criteria are too narrow, you won't find much.
honestly i was not sure of the idea of the rev, it's such a love-hate between motorists in montreal, * but * this summer i used the shit out of it, i felt safer as a cyclist, i felt less annoyed as a driver, and it was really cool to see st denis looking more .. human.
i’ll take the rev and madame plante’s cycling infrastructure over coderre’s which amounted to “painted lines” (where you still can easily be at risk from dangerous drivers)
tldr: i was scared for the longest time to cycle all across the city, with plante’s new infrastructure, myself and many other people are now happily cycling across the city safely and far more frequently than before.
but no one uses it! / s
i use it daily. i go 15 minutes out of my way to use it because it’s just so much safer than my normal route. hopefully we can see more of this infrastructure in the near future. 
… maybe take down the stupid fence on acadie and add it there..? pls..?
rev is waste! we could have thrown ourselves a baseball stadium with all that money!
luckily coderre will come back to town hall and bring back the parking lot and the commuters with him
and, we hope, another great party for the 381st montreal!
i should have written “for his first year”, for a more precise title, but hey. it is possible to consult the data of bicycle counters across the city here:

`` the dream is every day ''
\ - a frustrated surely
impeccable timing for tonight's debate. i can't wait to see coderre shit on the rev when this important milestone was reached today!
my deepest gratitude to the people who designed this stretch. efficient, fast. safe. the figures prove it.
coderre will never dare to dismantle this track if he is elected ... even if he is not lacking the desire.
yep, it’s great, love taking the rev. i biked all through last year, even winter, and the bike infrastructure like this made it easy.
before the rev i often had problems with passing motorists, etc. which did not encourage me to reach the city center by bicycle. now it's good but a rev in the city center is sorely lacking, not this pathetic bike path on maisonneuve in the left blind spot of the cars which required separate traffic lights and in addition not synchronized so stop and go to all the two seconds is boring ...
it's one of the best lanes in the city now! barely affects parking, separates everyone. and makes it super safe & direct to go north in the city. hopefully it helps start a push for more lanes like it.
really, i started really riding my bike this summer, and i loved the rev.
beautiful achievement.
i worked on the construction for 3 months, as my job was canceled due to the covid ... them, 90%, didn't like the rev! ):
this saturday we take a bike ride to celebrate and demand that we keep the track on bellechasse! 
that's awesome. i'd love to know how many cars use the street as well in the same time period. but then again, it's not like anyone looks at pedestrian counts versus car counts as an argument for abolishing sidewalks. so maybe it's all just a moot point. roads, sidewalks, and separated bike lanes everywhere, so everyone can enjoy getting around how they wish. what a concept!
don't be distracted by a talkative italian owner who has lost his parking spot; the cycle path on bellechasse is also used extensively.
that's amazing !
a bit forced like fr english, but good to each his own.
this year is my first time riding a bike in montreal, i was too scared before. these cycle paths like the rev change everything !!
i'm the same. i never rode in the city before due to fear. i moved to the east end  the rev is amazing!!!! got a bixi membership and rode everywhere
its the same dude doing a million trips /s
holness who says we should privatize the stm. this is a bad idea! it's just going to skyrocket the prices!
okay, coderre doing his erin o toole.
coderre: "i have a plan"
holness and plante: "what is this plan?"
coderre: "i have a plan"
a bécyk permit. i immediately had the image of a big charger sticking my niece with her little wheels.
then a license to skate, roller blade, grocery basket udder ...
me who thought that sylvain larocque was the only humorist who presented himself to the municipal hahaha
"what are you going to do about the blue line?"
"city-state!"
anything.
still better to watch than the habs game
me, who was looking to go see a comedy show, we were still well served!
i really don't like coderre, plante was quite correct and i just learned that there is a third candidate ...
take a shot every time valerie plante cuts off another candidate.
update: im already trashed.
valerie looked like she was on powder. she tweeted and cut others off. not to mention his uneasy laugh.
come buy something in montreal, if you have a kid sent me a box of cossin.
holtness is fun in this debate. he is cracking, does not know his files and he takes the time to entine in the second part that we want to hear
montréal is dirty sale sale
it's funny to see the people with their 3 accounts chatting to themselves .. you're discreet, the tall one !! lol
impressed with balarama.
it won't be easy!
nothing will be easy!
i am scared.
i’m scared.
i am marked.
i’m scarred.
help us mister coderre.
help us mister coderre
valérie plante is as cave as donald trump when it comes to not respecting the speaking turn.
will you shut up? so unmayor-like.
what is that ?!
i want to believe that montrealers are so biased that you could spit in the face of any other candidate and receive a standing ovation, but someone could tell this rabid bitch that decorum, respect and right to speak also exist?
really awkward debate, i'm pissed. fuck plant.
lmao, privatize the majority of trips on the island, how could that go wrong!
the motorist lobby stinks so much that the cyclist's license. it is removing the only other free means of transportation besides walking.
it is taxing active transportation and the health of citizens.
worse, the license is the saaq, not montreal. the spvm will control cyclists from the south shore on the bridge?
it's not a bad idea. this is a real bad idea.
it would be going back in time as it was once in montreal.
is his book going to be in it?
i haven't seen the list of items in the box, but i hope it will be useful and made in montreal.
these are great, lot of precedent in scandinavia, but could she promise something even a little more generally impactful? 
anyone who learns about these is not going to oppose these, they shouldn't be a campaign promise just introduction of a new policy.
she should focus on building houses or we will stop making children out of them.
i am going against the wave of cynicism and say that this is a great idea. it gives parents the possibility of getting everything they need to take care of a newborn with very little cost, usually free but this time its going to be 100$. its a small gesture that can really benefit low income parents. they have clothes in various sizes to fit babies when they start to grow. the box can be used as a bed. they have childrens books, washable diapers, thermometer, toutous. its not a grand gesture but i believe that it is a small gesture that should be implemented and hopefully expended
a hell of a joke. i don't understand how people endure his false sympathy. it's really taking us for idiots.
this would be a good time to remind everyone that coderre spent more than this would cost, on a gazebo and fake granite tree stumps in a forest.
$2,000,000 is pocket change when your budget is over $5 billion, at least this goes to something that is obviously useful. i'm not quite sure how useful fake tree stumps in a forest are though.
...but why?
>diapers, pyjamas and metro and museum tickets
i say that like a parent of 3 children: it's a waste of tax. instead of taking my taxes to buy me a dozen diapers in a box, let me buy the diapers i want.
i have no kids. i already pay more than enough for school taxes, taxes for affordable day care and all of the other services. i'm ok paying for that knowing it eventually makes our society better.
this baby box thing though, yeah f that. 
during her first term, she broke a promise that she wouldn't raise taxes past inflation rate. she announced new metro lines, but no dates have been set yet. 
maybe she should deliver on her previous promises instead of forcing us - the tax payers - to spend more for "cute little things"
i'd rather have a family doctor to have adequate prenatal and postnatal care...
how about we focus on our infrastructure? the state of the streets is pitiful
if elected, i will spend your money needlessly
i have no children and am starting to have my buttocks full of paying taxes always for the families. isn't there already ace for that ?!
another reason to not vote for her!!! 🤣🤣🤣
i walk around this city, around the orange cones, the detours, the potholes, the small businesses getting choked into bankruptcy by the debilitating infrastructure works and road closures and this is where this imbecile's priorities lie?  baby packs?
can't wait to vote this moron out.
no. sorry, no. that's enough. it is not the role of a municipal administration to take care of this. already our taxes go to many programs for families (including helping families who are already owners, to buy housing on the island up to $ 630,000!)
$2,000,000. really? good grief. i'm so glad i live close to montreal but just outside of it and am not under her ridiculous thumb.
it's a small gesture but definitely useful for any parents, especially first time parents or those who have premature kids (aka their little bundle of joy decides to pop out a lil earlier...). would be extra cool if they partnered with montreal/quebec based fabricants to support local businesses. obviously more needs to be done to support new families, but this is a move in the right direction.
oh geez i'm over the moon. just what we need! giving more freebies to parents.
-_-
it’s not the municipal’s job to do that.
it takes an uneducated screeching electorate for this kind of proposal to be popular.
ok these oddly specific weather stats are a bit ridiculous lol
is "specific" the right word for this?  11°c is just as specific as 20°c, it's just not as nice looking a number.
on top of this, today, the reported weather are reported at the dorval airport and already has bias (example: traces of snow while not snowing due to winds and the absences of building). now you going back 100 years ago? trust me, give me a temperature meter and depending where i am on the island, it will be different.
to the guy that posted that crap graphic, global warming is real and these data do not take in account all records we reaches this year.
i actually like[mcgill's land acknowledgement]( and is much more nuanced and conciliatory than what we've seen the habs do:
>*"mcgill university is on land which has long served as a site of  meeting and exchange amongst indigenous peoples, including the haudenosaunee and anishinabeg nations. we acknowledge and thank the diverse indigenous peoples whose presence marks this territory on which peoples of the world now gather."*
it doesn't grant stewardship to any group, acknowledges past contribution, has an attitude of "vivre ensemble", is not exclusive to any one indigenous group ('indigenous peoples, **including')**, and recognizes contemporary contributions that made montreal what it is. it places montreal first and foremost as a place of meeting and exchange, a role it had since *la grande paix de montréal*, where it served as a site of meeting and exchange between the first nations and the french. 
overall, if you're gonna have an acknowledgement, i find that this one is the best. it's inclusive, relevant, modern, and conciliatory.
i believe that there are reasonable grounds for arguing that the montreal territory is unceded indigenous territory, but it is simply historically indefensible to argue that it is unceded * mohawk * territory. i don't think there are many historians who seriously defend this point of view, which is limited to a handful of activists.
it is not because there are mohawk reserves in the suburbs of montreal in 2021 that the territory is traditionally mohawk. the story is much more complex (and interesting) than that.
i love the habs but they shouldn't be getting involved in this debate. they also have a huge potential for myth-making and i can understand how the nationalist-minded people can be horrified by this decision.
the fact that anglade immediately leans on the side of politically correct, despite the admitted historical lie, shows that the plq has already returned to its traditional reflexes. this despite the turn that she predicted to want to make the party take.
rich from the molson family.
did any of these rich white men ever consider asking the various nations about this? just curious here... my guess is "no"
this is indeed historically false, according to several historians and experts. i trust them more than wokes who try to make us feel guilty if we don't think like them, even if they don't give a damn about the facts, accuracy, thoroughness and context \ *.
\ * the notion of context is also what poses the most problem to the woke movement, which generally does not know what to do with it, given their usual cultural and historical ignorance.
(to downvote, it's the little arrow here at the bottom).
i would like people to talk about the fact that the french canadians did not necessarily agree with the treaty of paris and that on that account quebec too could be considered as a territory claimed and conquered by force ... just saying
acknowledgments like this do jack shit. it’s white people patting themselves on the back for “doing a good deed”. are you planning on giving back the land? no? then your acknowledgment is empty air.
"acknowledges past contributions" and "recognize contemporary contributions" how? i don't mean to sound ignorant or rude, but i fail to see this as a tangible contribution since there wasn't an owner
very good point!
i prefer this one from the peer support centre at mcgill:
> the peer support centre operates as part of mcgill university, which is located on the unceded territories of indigenous peoples, including the haudenosaunee and anishinabeg nations, which has long served as a site of meeting and exchange. more specifically, our campus is built on territory that has long acted as a site of meeting and exchange amongst the kanien’kehá:ka peoples, who are the rightful stewards of these lands and waters. we are settlers here on tiohtià:ke (montréal), which is situated in the larger turtle island (north america). we must understand and work against the ways in which colonial violence manifests in all facets of life, including but not limited to, restricted access to and oppression within mental and physical care sectors, which can and have been used as weapons of colonialism.
in the 16th century, at the time that jacques cartier arrived in the st-lawrence river valley, it's indisputable that montreal was populated by groups of people characterized by archaeologists as iroquoians--they had a distinctive style of ceramics, practised agriculture and lived in longhouses, and had been living in this region for centuries.
linguistically and culturally, they had much in common with neighbouring iroquoian peoples such as the wendat and the haudenosaunee (i.e., the people of the longhouse, whose eastern door was defended by the mohawks.) (look at the [vocabulary]( that cartier compiled and see the similarities between st-lawrence iroquoian and mohawk words.)
there is evidence of considerable exchange and interaction between the mohawk river valley and the st-lawrence river at this time--if you look at a map, you'll realize that for people used to travel in canoes, the lake champlain-richelieu river system was a virtual highway that invited constant interaction (hunting, fishing, trading, raiding, marrying) between peoples living at either end of the waterway.
and in fact, there are iroquoian artifacts from the 14th-17th centuries that have been unearthed along this entire river-lake system, leading archaeologists to conclude that there was a complex and varied iroquoian social and cultural world that encompassed the entire territory, from the finger lakes of present-day new york to the st-lawrence river valley.
this population was dynamic, and one of the shifts that took place during the course of the late 16th century was the abandonment of settlements in the st-lawrence river valley--warfare being the most commonly posited cause, but the evidence is not definitive. 
it seems that the greatest share of the iroquoians who left montreal and other parts of the st-lawrence river valley wound up in mohawk communities north of the mohawk river (some archaeological evidence from pottery and pipes provides evidence of this migration; see the work of james pendergast).
it is almost certain, however, that the people who migrated into mohawk territory continued to hunt and fish in montreal and surrounding areas well into the 17th century. when maisonneuve and the french "founded" montreal--bearing in mind that this was an act of colonial conquest--they were almost immediately attacked by mohawks who were engaging in regular hunting and raiding expeditions to the st-lawrence during the summer. 
the jesuit priest barthélemy vimont (jesuit relations, vol. 24, chapter 12) remarked in 1642 that "in former years, the iroquois came in rather large bands at certain times in the summer, and afterward left the river free: but, this present year, they have changed their plan, and have separated themselves into small bands of twenty, thirty, fifty, or a hundred at the most, along all the passages and places of the river; and when one band goes away, another succeeds it."
embroiled in increasingly violent warfare, many mohawks--following a broader pattern of northward and westward migration that characterized iroquoia in the second half of the 17th century--eventually decided to permanently establish agricultural villages in the st-lawrence river valley by the 1660s.
while these villages were ethnically and linguistically diverse, it's almost certain that a large share of their inhabitants were descended from the people who lived in st-lawrence iroquoian settlements centuries earlier.
so yes, it is complicated and nuanced--but then again, one wouldn't say that the french don't have sovereignty over their own territory because they're not all descended from the gauls, do we? and i don't think it's that much of a stretch to describe montreal as traditional mohawk territory.
> the story is much more complex (and interesting) than that.
yes!
corporate virtue signalling at its finest.
mainly from the molson family who have a lot to apologize for for their own past.
let's apologize for setting the parliament on fire. to apologize for the actions * of others * is hypocritical.
let's say that the gang of multi millionaires that is the habs team could, from a materialistic perspective, do so much more.
but hey, slogans are free!
it's like a reflex that's almost impossible to eliminate. they react with emotions first and then, perhaps, they reflect or inquire.
dont worry they probably have a whole diversity inclusion and equity team working round the clock, the have paid their progressive indulgence and have been absolved of their sins... for now.
crap, i got the wrong arrow ...
one mistake? no
one big fucking mistake? very well could be
i dunno depends on the crime.. i guess if you worked for the cops and sold sensitive info to criminals is not a good thing for your reputation .
the guy lied for years..... but so did denis coderre. so he should be safe.
as he said, he reaped the consequences of his actions and he is aware of his wrong-doing. prosper is an exceptional candidate who has a major chance at making a difference in people’s lives. i don’t think that we should shun people forever for a f***-up when they have taken accountability for said mistakes and are aiming to do better! he’s a better candidate than most people running, regardless of his history.
dont think coderre lied about a murder investigation though.
i guess attila the hun was a good guy, even though he killed thousands... deep down, he did good for his peeps
people literally get canceled for less.. 
worse still, those found guilty of high treason and espionage, that's life imprisonment.
that we know of*
maybe not a murder case, but adding all the lies and half-truth he ever put up.. that sure adds up to a murder case…  gerald tremblay would be real proud of him…
wtf..
i guess if americans can turn a blind eye to trump, you can do the same to satisfy your narrative
this is a better option because sherbrooke street has the potential to be rearranged and more friendly to pedestrians (widen sidewalks, have terraces, bike path, more trees, etc.) but with the rem viaduct the potential will be lost forever.
i like the first proposition, especially for the correspondence with radisson vs hb and not so much because it's underground (i live in the east and i don't mind an aerial route over sherbrooke).
for those unfamiliar with the area, radisson has a large bus terminal for buses coming from different suburbs, while the hb terminal is more for focusing on local buses.
i expected to see something ridiculous. on the contrary, it seems much more sense than what is currently proposed by the cdpq infra.
i am not against.
but it seems like a weird height / underground mix ??
yes n. the truth is that the population density east of pie-ix is probably insufficient to justify the costs of tunneling there using the rem's mode of financing. the government should make the difference longer.
frankly, montreal ...
choice 1: the lady who strives to improve our city (even if it is not perfect, the effort that is put in is remarkable)
choice 2: mr. corruption himself ...
like, c'mon guys! it shouldn't even be close.
i almost regret having left the island, just to be able to vote against coderre.
still very undecided, it's crazy all the same.
wow, i saw the breakdown, pis plante has 36% voting intention among those with a university degree, compared to coderre who has only 23%, ... thoughts?
lmao 5% for holness
> this is barely more than the 4% granted to the chef of montreal 2021, luc ménard.
who is that luc ménard, wtf?
interestingly, the last crop poll gave coderre a lead of 5% (before distribution of the undecided) and there, they are almost equal.
also, people who are very satisfied with valérie plante are more likely to be sure to vote. but coderre attracts 5% of voters among the oldest (who vote more).
nothing to play yet!
the amount of hate for anyone who says anything positive regarding any policy that coderre or holness proposés has led to an echo chamber in this subreddit.
and 5% for holness.
here i am again commenting on the terrible coderre campaign. because his campaign is entirely negative, his strategy is "vote for me because i am your only option". which, unfortunately, is not enough to make people want to vote for you. you just get deflated and already discouraged people. we saw what happened in the 2016 trump campaign (yes, there were a lot more issues than just the campaign), clinton was just emphasizing that she was better than her opponent and people just weren't excited to vote for her. valérie plante has roughly the same level of satisfaction that she had at the end of her term, and yet she had a much higher voting intention, people were more enthusiastic to vote for her, as she had both an “i am better than him” campaign but also major projects that have made people dream. i just don't understand why he constantly pulls out big projects and yet never capitalizes them. her entire campaign is fear-based, and while she gets people to vote for you, it's not enough to make people want to vote, especially the undecided.
valérie plante also has a terrible campaign, and i think she also relies on the tactic of fear a little too much, but not as much as coderre, she tries to bring a more positive approach to her campaign, by emphasizing on its neighborhood approach, but not enough in my opinion.
vote for balarama.
hopefully balarama can pull through. would be amazing to see these clowns fail.
frankly, is montreal a new party?
coderre = liberal. we saw at the federal level that it was enough to get elected from afar in the english-speaking sectors and a large part of the french-speaking population.
honestly, i didn't really have any intention to vote... until i heard our beloved coderre is coming back.
yeah, everyone should be voting for balarama holness instead of those two clowns.
tse!
wathever ... montreal is less and less livable .... it's imploding ..... but if montrealers re-read codrerre .... mouhahaha !!!! it really is the beginning of the end!
me too
yes, but at least you can vote for catherine.
you can buy 4 x 5kg bags at canadian tire.
>i'm looking for a lot of baking soda.
what unit of measurement are we talking about here? kg, tubs, pallets, tanks, fiftwheels, ten-wheelers, wagons or liners?
try a food service place like sysco, gfs, ideal foods, regitan, and dubord & rainville. some are open to the public, some are not.
could try aubut?
mayrand if i am not cheating on you
costco?
have you looked at bulk barn?
aubut, mayrand or look at bulkbarn
try les âmes fleurs. they sell it up to 22.68kg but they charge extra for delivery. 
or at the merci grocery store (
try calling brenntag in lachine.
bulk children
now if only somebody had a barn that sold items in bulk.
des "burger square per freedom eagle"
20 kg !!
lol i laughed too much 😂
a red line would give too much the impression on google maps that it is congestion all over the place;)
from what i understand, lines ab and c designate the three branches of the rem which will separate in the north of the island towards deux-montagnes, sainte-anne and the airport:  /default/files/2018-08/carte-rem-james-amend.jpg
presumably, the eastern rem is going to be line d (and up).
i don't really like the color because i find it ugly but it's good that it looks like those of the metro since the rem is a light metro and that will allow it to be distinguished from train lines
that map dates from the early planning stages and should probably be ignored. it also shows the outgoing numbered fare zones and it has provisional station names.
when the first rem trains were shown off to the media, [they had this diagram inside]( showing the [a1]( branches mentioned by op. (though i suspect they will have something different indicating the new lettered fare zones when they actually enter service.)
yes, it's a beautiful graphic and it's a shame that this is not the official version of cdpqi. to my knowledge, this is just an artistic version created to illustrate what the different types of sideboards would look like.
spot on! it seems that they want to mimic the parisian rer network, for which a letter was given to each line. their different branches have also a letter and a number. for example, a4 is the branch you want to take if you want to get off at disneyland paris station [line a map](
i am surprised at the rendering, it is very pretty!
beauty!
wow, this is surreal; the thumbnail looks more like a drawing than a photo
really beautiful photo, look like an intro for a dracula story.
really not bad!
beautiful, i love watching the full moon rise....not tonight though! waah!
damn! what’s the focal length on that lens?
superb photo, i love the quality of the colors and the rendering of details for the distance… do you use a telescope 🔭 (a real telescope? i have a nexstar 8se) or just an adjustable zoom clipped onto a mobile? i'm really impressed! nice job 😊🙌
angery mün
hi i’m just commenting on this post bc it’s recent. i’m looking for advice. :) my precious boyfriend is from montreal and moved to the us almost a year ago. i want to get him some things from “home” as a gift. what kind of things should i be looking for? we’re in tx by the way, so i’m trying to start early since some things may take a long time to get here.
important info: he is 29. software engineer. lived in montreal most of his life. mcgill & concordia grad.
and tonight (oct 20) you can see the moon like that again. look is ~ 18: 17
thanks! it clouded up a few minutes after, so we got lucky catching this. 
try and spit it tonight (oct 20) in the east starting at 6:17 pm
i was doing a workshop last night with a mother and her 7 year old son. it was the first time they’d come to a moonrise and they were blown away
thank you!
i actually was able to see it for just a few moments after it rose, but then it got covered by clouds again:
i used my telescope, with my phone attached to it. here’s the link to it:
focal length: 1250mm
yes! for this photo i used a c90 mak and my iphone xs (
an orange cone would most definitely make him laugh.
if it was me though, i'd love to get something like an expo jersey. pretty rare that people have those nowadays and it's nice nostalgic piece given his age.
ideas that may or may not apply depending on taste:  
montreal bagels (+smoked salmon and cream cheese?). can be frozen for transport.    
a "postcard" showing the worst that winter has to offer ([example1]( [example2]( so he does not miss the snow too much.   
quebec microbrew beers, or ice cider.  
maple syrup (bonus point if it comes with crêpes).   
[orange cone plushie](  
also, you can just make a new post. the sub is not that inactive.
i did see it later on, but was blurry and of course, that means rain. i actually have a really good view of the full moon and love watching it right from my front window. however, it's overcast right now.
there will surely be articles with a little more substance coming out in the next few days, but i wanted to get the scoop for the sub. edit: [afp article (edit 2: now it says ap ...)] ( wins-the-competition-frederic-chopin.php)
context: [the chopin competition] ( is an international classical piano competition based on the works of frédéric chopin, which takes place every 5 years. it is probably the most prestigious and competitive piano competition in the world. winning this competition almost automatically guarantees an overnight international concert career. some names you might recognize from past winners: martha argerich (1st place, 1965), maurizio pollini (1st place, 1960), krystian zimerman (1st place, 1975), vladimir ashkenazy (2nd place, 1955), daniil trifonov (3rd place, 2010), etc.
xiaoyu liu was born in paris but is raised and lives in montreal. he was trained by local masters such as richard raymond, at the montreal conservatory. he is currently studying with đặng thái sơn, a former winner of the competition, at the university of montreal. during an interview between the final and the unveiling of the results, xiaoyu liu revealed that in his spare time, he enjoys go-karting.
note that another canadian, torontonian jj jun li bui, finished 6th. they were the only two canadians in the final.
also, not only is this the first time that a canadian has won this contest, it is only the second time that canadians * make it to the finals *. the first and only other time that canadians had made it to the final was during the last edition, in 2015. quebecer charles richard-hamelin was then 2nd, and torontonian tony yike yang had finished 5th, becoming the youngest pianist to ever make the top 6, two achievements already remarkable in themselves. let's aim for 3 laureates for 2025, so to pianists who will be under 30 years old by this date: to your keyboards!
in short, montreal has much to be proud of!
the performance in question:
wow, incredible success for the conservatory / udem
thanks for sharing. i found it amazing!
yes thanks! he really torches. also cool that the contest puts everything online for free like that. [here is charles richard-hamelin in the final in 2015] ( who played the other concerto.
thank you for the link!
yes! between xiaoyu liu's victory today and charles richard-hamelin's 2nd place in 2015 (who was then also studying in montreal, with andré laplante and jean saulnier if i remember correctly — teachers from the conservatory and udem, respectively — and who had studied at mcgill in the past), i wouldn't be surprised if there is an influx of young prodigies from all over the world who come to montreal in the next few years to study.
we remember the coderre filter for integrity ...
well, it's not working.
it will be remembered that coderre was extremely aggressive in the media on this story, speaking of defamation ... obviously there is a public interest.
lol.
when you change your name ... that says it all.
> mr. coderre believes that the procedures for background checks on candidates wishing to run for his party are sufficient. "we have done all the checks, there is no problem," he said.
are you sure of that denis?
again????
> well, it's not working.
maybe yes. why are you assuming it's the corrupt that the filter rejects?
almost seems like for him currency frauds are not problems lolol
ah! you got a point.
it would even be logical. if you're using a filter for pathogens, you don't want it in your water.
so if you have an integrity filter ...
there have always been interactions / exchanges with organized crime (especially the mafia), but when your police force has reached the point of asking a criminal group to clean up an area, it shows how point our system is badly made and so incompetent ...
pretty crazy that in this article you have the police asking the mafia to get a handle on gun trade and an acknowledgement that the hells are responsible for the lack of fentanyl laced drug. can we get either of them to run patrols too?
many thanks to the rizzuto family!
i'm waiting for the district 31 episode on the subject before deciding.
it's not new, everything has always been like this except that in the past the media did not have the resources to publish it.
it's an open secret. certain crimes are tolerated to maintain the illusion of peace.
the rizzutos brought peace from violence in montreal’s streets before. it’s fairly well known that they brought the irish mob, the hatian street kings, the hells, the triads and the italian mob into an era of pragmatic cooperation back in the day, there was even a documentary about it at some point, you could probably find it on youtube.
a good point for coderre that. they worked for them for 4 years, they owe him that.
this is disheartening… when we ask for their protection (essentially), we’re legitimizing this parasitic crime organization.
yes, let's make a deal with the devil. that always works out fine.
the mafia is not accountable to the people. it's win-win… / s
it's a matter of choosing the least worst. the hells and the mafia are, not ironically, organized professionals who understand the consequence of their actions. i can't wait to see them take control of the street gangs.
i think that's also what bad blood covers (netflix)
it has always been like that, this is nothing new. the city can tolerate the non-violent criminal activities but public executions are too much for the population to handle.
they're already legitimized. you think saputo never had to deal with rizzuto?
lesser of two evils. organized crime is, as the name says, organized. they know that attention is bad for business, so they strive to keep a low profile and when there are conflicts, they deal with them quietly and with few collateral victims. the cops prefer to deal with that rather than with stupid kids who shoot up half a block with innocent victims because someone offended them on instagram/tiktok.
there will always be organized crime. the important thing is above all to leave the monopoly to the less worst.
police who stop people in certain areas: they are racists.
mafia who deal with the problem in the same sector: all good.
i am not against it. eradicating crime is a pipe dream.
about as realistic as the war on drugs ever being won (thank god america is gradually giving up that pointless battle)
it looks a lot like an expo 67 pavilion that no longer exists, doesn't it?
i think the best people to talk with are the archivists at the [cca]( canadian centre for architecture) they have a whole collection dedicated to [expo 67]( including a very deep collection of photos of the construction..
[found ]( picture for you & this [one](
based on this [site]( the location was originally for czechoslovakia but was turned into the "band shell" for 68,69,70 it is unclear if it was changed or removed for 71 "public safety".
if i understand correctly the b was indicative of this being a minor location compare to the ["main bandshell"]( so as the 2nd photo shows it would showcase smaller musical groups like the highschool band  ...if i had to take a guess similar construction techniques was used in the main shell as the smaller one so you might find more photos of that big one under construction .
my 2cents about creating a model (i am not an architect) depending what materials/machines you have available & what your prof is expecting from you  you could tackle this in different ways. i would be tempted to model the frame in sections and print them with a wood pla that can be sanded&stained this would make getting the angles super easy and you could recolor or use a regular pla to make the steel components as well if you wanted to print them separately, i would then find some really thin wood  veneer(the stuff on rolls) and use that to skin the frame/alternate is go get those little formica/counter laminate sample cards and cut them up  .this seems faster then getting(balsa wood?) and hand making the entire frame
oh if you don't mind please come back and share pictures of the finished model !
hello, i am an architecture student in the united states and i was wondering if anyone knows where this pavilion is located or has images of it. in my course, i was assigned to recreate this structure into a physical model and all the information i have on it is in the posted image. i have been dredging through google trying to find information and actual images of it to help with the recreation but with no luck. any help is much appreciated and i apologize if this is the incorrect subreddit for this type of post.
update: the structure was in expo 67, i found it in the background of birds eye view photos of the event. it's next to west germany`s pavilion. just need a photo of the structure now. thank you for those who commented.
update: it's in the great britain section of the expo.
you have the architect name.
you could do some historical googling.
[
you make me doubt my google skill.
do you have the year of construction or the location?
it was much bigger buildings, here it's a background for a show stage.
you sir are a god sent. thank you and i will contact them.
i'm pretty sure it doesn't exist anymore.
it looks like structure that was created for expo 67 and, as other said, it doesn't exist anymore. you  could try to reach this [organisation]( they have a huge set of archive document that might prove useful. good luck!
we'd love to see the model when you're done! and the research that went into it :)
bruh, all that left with the monorail. look for montreal of 1967-1970
i found that link and looked through their archived work with no avail. when you google the architect not much comes up that is relevant to this structure. his latter works are award winning though and are recognized.
an exact date and location no. all i can conclude from my limited google success and surmising is that it's in montreal along a waterfront of some sort and it was most likely built in the 60s. that's it.
another photo, in colour, is available at 
yup, the structure is mostly plywood!
thank you very much, i will contact the organization and see if i got lucky.
not directly relevant to your project, but if you want to put the structure in context, check the expo 67 site map (a little above and to the left of the ship in the seaway).
if you want to find more pictures, i suggest searching for the pics of the adjacent pavilions as the bandstand was one of the more minor structures of the fair.
thank you, that's a really nice photo of it. the photos i have found are of either exquisite clarity or very grainy. there doesn't seem to be a middle point.
i agree and gave been saying this for years. the cdn-ndg is too large to run efficiently. it's nothing to do with "division"
the borough is already literally cut in two thanks to the highway... so there is some logic in this.
i honestly never understood this. it’s by far the largest borough, even the geographical shape doesn’t make sense. cut it down!
yes, with decarie as the limit between the two districts
be careful what you say, it may be libel. denis trusts him.
i'm convinced 5eme av store is a front. even when things were busy i never say anyone inside and they have a bunch of locations all close to eachother. let's be honest.. a good chunk of those stores are a bit strange
lol 5th avenue is not a good example, everyone knows it is only for money laundering.
these kinds of shopping experiences today feel tacky, cheap and outdated unfortunately. it feels like a holdover from a time when the whole underground thing was still a novelty, probably as recently as the early 2000's. sadly, going into these stores these days just feels kind of...weird. i could see why they aren't getting much business. would probably do better if montreal had a larger population (e.g. look at japan where you have businesses tucked away in all these little books and crannies where the sun never shines but they have the population + culture to support that).
it also doesn't help that many montreal store owners are terribly behind the times. how many stores in the city feel like they belong in the year 1992? i live right next to st. hubert plaza where the modern sits right next to the bizzarely outdated and it's very plain to see. walking into some of these stores feels like taking a step back in time. i get that most of these stores probably don't have the money to invest but entering them is often not very pleasant, if i'm honest. it might work fine in lower income neighborhoods but downtown montreal is anything but these days.
in the long run, even when everyone has their “hybrid telework / face-to-face” work schedule, there will likely be an oversupply in the city center. it's a lot better to concentrate activity and surface traffic on streets like sainte-catherine, which are attractive to a lot more people. the basement shops, part of the space offer will have to find another vocation. 1,700 businesses are enormous.
much of the underground mtl could be an art trail in my opinion.
it's sad ... i love the montreal souterrain, even if it's mostly stores. it is unique in the world. in my opinion, the traffic will never come back to the way it used to be. there are tons of very happy people telecommuting ... and they won't want to go back to the office.
is the title a play on words? 😋
i rarely go downtown (and the montréal souterrain).  
i assume those shops used to cater to the office crowds at lunch time and when they leave in the evening.
i always have questions about that store (and some of the jewelry stores) in that section... i've never seen them busy, pandemic or not, and it's kinda depressing and sketchy. maybe they did well with a more student/buyer who likes to negotiate?
*money laundering*
are there econofitnesses in prison?
more than 25,000 households live in deplorable conditions in buildings where the owner is none other than the government.
if a private owner managed a building like the government does, the municipal authorities would condemn the building in less than 2 seconds and this owner would go to the news every week as well as before the tal to be punished with damages and interest and of prescriptions (and with good reason)
welp, you wanted the city as a landlord… something something berlin. /s
what if they renovate ... will they raise the rent too?
i think it's weird how much coverage he gets for how little traction he has.
we see the kind of "leadership" that holness exercises. whenever there is a problem, it is the fault of the other.
he has nothing to do with it. never.
in my opinion, his platform is already a red flag, but the elements of his personality that are starting to emerge confirms to me that this guy there just has nothing to do with being mayor of montreal.
how long have they been sitting on this
who the hell is balarama holiness?? lmao
is it me, or reading that didn't discredit him as a potential mayor in any way
edit: i feel like people forget what a politician, vying for positions of power, really is.
i mean, it was predictable from ten thousand miles away.
a dude who goes in the public light, trips over his own two feet on a constant basis, and spreads discord like it was a national sport?  **the media jerks off to that shit.**  for them, it's an absolute gold mine of viewers and clicks.  free money.  the stories just write themselves.
he has a lot of controversial ideas, while plante and coderre are campaigning much more moderate and calm.
plante and coderre still have most of the media coverage, it's just that holness has managed to get an interesting piece of it, for better or for worse.
is he one of the only three serious candidates for mayor of montreal? should we go the extra mile to shut up and hide our scandals in your opinion?
because he wants to challenge the francophone status quo. i think his ideas are ridiculous, but him gaining momentum while wanting montreal to be bilingual is welcomed by anglophones and hated by francophones so ….
> we see the kind of "leadership" that holness exercises.
leadercheap. purchased from dollarama.
news orgs "sit" on a lot of stories all the time for a lot of different reasons.
> balarama holiness
it is certain that he presents himself as a martyr after the elections.
"holness told cbc news he used the contact list from montreal in action to send emails for mouvement."
this is a big red flag for instance. thats not allowed at all.
it's you.
it gives me a better sense of how he really is and i don’t like it. i won’t be voting for him.
there's a dozen sentences of positivity in the middle of a sea of negativity, 50% of which comes from someone on his team...
it really should, guy is a total hack
if even after that, you consider it acceptable, that's your opinion, but let's say you can't really complain about coderre's ego / personality afterwards.
unfortunately montrealers don't want identity in their politics unless it's their own identity. the moment this hypocritical stance gets questioned it becomes an overall sad situation, comparable to a scared animal backed into a corner. example:
yeah i don't go for that, there's been many clowns who did not get this amount of coverage. that's why it's notable.
our city is so beautiful we are so lucky.
this is southwest of cohen if i'm wrong
this is a fantastic photo
well done! seize the right moment; the key to excellence in photography,
very beautiful photo!
thank you !
i still think that we should have a counter in the sidebar for the number of photos of this place posted on the sub

i assume "sanitation" is a code word for declaring certain areas blighted so that they can justify knocking them down.  also i don't know how effective basements and 3 story extensions are compared to instead zoning out single family detached homes.  none of that will have an impact without mandating sizes so that we get more middle and low income affordability.
it's not the worst plan i have heard, but it seems to pass over some low hanging fruit which i assume is because rich donors don't want those changes.  like restricting short term rentals and pied-à-terres seems like a majority would be in favor.  or do the majority of montreal actually like those?
in case the title isn't clear, this is an analysis of ensemble's platform. cult mtl is reviewing each of the party's platforms.
but who cares?

also, when this situation is dealt with, consider keeping two copies of all important data. all hard drives eventually die, the only question is how long it will be.

canada computer should be able to do a basic diagnostic for you.
i would suggest checking with another cable first to rule that possibility out,depending how comfortable you are with a screwdriver you could open it up depending the model it might be possible to plug in a cable directly to the drive with an inexpensive adapter cable (usually under 20.00) to see if it is a bad board/connector.
while i don't have any local suggestions i can tell you that services generally come under 3 categories 1) those that do the work themselves on site 2)companies that have an office or store front that they collect drives and mail them to a central lab  3)companies that send out to a 3rd party service(this tends to be the most expensive) not every drive repair needs to handled in a clean room or sent to drive savers and billed at 1000s of dollars
[ is local and they have been recommend on here a few times same with 
\[hdd recovery services\]([ (in ottawa but has mail in service) is well known and has very interesting \[youtube videos\]([
gonna keep this post close.  like dude said, “ it’s just a matter  of time ‘til they die.”
google's your friend.  easeus data recovery wizard is good.  pirate it...
you can usually open the case and it's a plain old hard drive inside.  sometimes the hard drive has a specific hardware connector that only goes out to usb, other times there's an adaptor from 'regular tower pc connector' on the disk to a usb thing.  if that's the case, you can try plugging it in to a tower pc in case the little usb board died.
oh for sure....thanks! 
vitaldata is right near by where i live.
thanks!
yes, i tried plugging it into another laptop, but i guess i can get another cable. 
i've heard of vitaldata, i'll check them out. no, i am not comfortable opening it up with a screwdriver, i've done some repairs but i'd rather not risk it in this case.
thanks again!
i fortunately saved a lot of data and documents on a thumb drive, clouds, etc so i could get back to work, all my work stuff is saved. i did lose some stuff that might be on that hdd but i'll live, and get a nice new hdd.
i'd also recommend hddrecovery in ottawa. their youtube channel speaks well to their knowledge. good luck.
wherever you choose, i would suggest doing some research on them, i've heard too many poor outcomes. it's like hiring a home contractor.
nope, there's no way. it's undemocratic and ridiculous, imo, but that's how it currently is.
elections mtl is such a cluster fuck. i couldn't register for mail voting because my license has my old address on it but i'm on the electorate list with my new one (obviously) i have the sticker from saaq on it. i told them "what happens when i show up with my voter card but my license isn't accepted. "bring proof of residence like deed etc"
unfortunately there is no way, unlike for elections canada you will not be able to register on the day of… i know it sucks, and i also wonder why they make it so difficult for people to go vote and register in the first place… i went to register yesterday and it was such a tideous process :(
did you try.. calling them?
you can give an evening of volunteering at the party of your choice. the impact will likely be greater than a vote.
🤯😩
municipal elections are won as much by low voter turnout as it is by winning the hearts of their electors.  my local counselor wins with less than 4p0 total votes in his favour usually.
is that like... texting but with my mouth?
nice try mtlblog!
its soaring real estate prices
bars closed. downtown's empty. rents skyrocketing. half of the streets are blocked. can't drink. can't fuck. can't sleep. can't drive. 
new bike paths are great but a cool city they don't make.
that sounds like a trick question.... 😅
when the canadian was able to score goals ...
construction cones or potholes...
the sweet life.
still a few glory in montreal

hey we want a “world class city” ^/s
homebrew shops are a good bet. i've heard fire extinguisher places too, but dunno if they'd do sodastream, as i think it is a different thread or something. unfortunately, the homebrew shops are all a little far flung depending on where you are.
[deleted]
you should be able to buy/exchange empty bottles with filled one where they sell them (you get a discount when exchanging bottles)  
i get mine from the quincaillerie home hardware on st-laurent (corner vallière) (they reuse the bottles and they refill on site.)
if you have 2 tanks you can register a free pick up!!
get the co2 tank adaptor and get a big bottle of it at messer gas etc.
abp extinguishers in laval, from memory it was about $ 25 to fill a 20lb.
this guy in pointe-claire will swap your bottles for $8 each and has a loyalty card. good operation.  
hufill.com , they have 6 service points, 10$ for exchanges

there's a section of the montrealers site for resources, including [co2 refills]( i've used globe in lachine a bunch of times (but not in years, now). unsure if they do the tiny sodastream tanks; my refills were 15-20lbs, back then.
thank you everyone! so many choices! 😃
you can ask *any* questions about montreal to denis coderre at [dcoderre@vmtl.com](mailto:dcoderre@vmtl.com) 😆
dude !!! thank you!
i've been looking for a place not too far from my good for a while.
it's just 4 to 5 times more expansive than any other type of co2 refill
i don’t know if you were trying to be funny here but oh boy change career now.
yeah... political irony and subtility on reddit never work really well.
next time, i'll try to make fart jokes and explain them.
kids are mean. but at least this gives police some more insight into unraveling this gang war that’s spread to schools
no class, no respect, no empathy ... truly the worst human waste imaginable.
the joy of social networks. 😶
i don't want to flair this "elections 2021" but given that they ask the opinion of no less than three candidates in this article, seems appropriate.
[this?](
if it's not this or that, it's gotta be [the other thing](
the site of a million detoured west island buses whenever the 20 east of dorval is being worked on. or at least it used to be.
we sure are using the word 'tunnel' loosely here.
[this](
i'm 99% certain it's the spot posted by fr-_-mage. 
it was the narrowness of it that struck me. thanks everyone for helping me dig!
let's wish for some traffic tonight then :)
suspension a20-o around 13-n?
st. remi tunnel perhaps?
that's the first thing that came to my mind.
this must be it! not exactly how i remembered it (it's been a few years, i thought it was a natural rock formation).
thank you!!
it’s not on the way from lachine to the west island.
that's the first thing i thought even though it doesn't totally match the op description
u/fr-_-mage pick your flair
i came back to go shopping at provigo and on my way home, big police roadblock, ambulances, blocked streets. a young woman, attacked in broad daylight. 50 meters from my home. awful.
according to several witnesses who spoke to journalists present at the scene, she is said to have died. hope these are just false rumors.
good grief this is getting really terrible. 
not the targeted/ gang violence we were seeing primarily earlier in the year. how awful.
yvon said it, it's made fucked up.
already made a non-guilty plea. i bet the motherfucker is trying to get out on temporary insanity... hope they don't fall for his bullshit.
in milton park, not the plateau
what are we at the 16th feminicide this year in quebec? disgusting.
edith: 17th
this is awful! do we know if it was random or if they knew each other?
either way, i hope she pulls through!
this does not sound good
he stayed with her. didn't try to run away like the was feeling he loss of her, that he just caused.
we just had a massive gas leak yesterday too, shits been unlucky up on the hill.
i literally was just in that area on monday night looking for an apartment. womp womp.
the article has been updated, his death has been confirmed: /
>as the altercation continued, the man pulled out a knife and "stabbed   
the woman several times in her upper body," said montreal police   
spokesperson raphael bergeron.
we don't know what happened yet, but it feels like yet another domestic violence /feminicide case...
he said that 20 years ago. it must be made extra omega fucked up now.
technically part of the board
she died
people who get into fights etc, usually know each other. it's rare to get into an argument with a total stranger.
he was her ex-roommate.
edit: just saw new info on rc that he was her ex-partner.
this is just so sad.
the murderer stayed next to the victim after he was done , so i’m guessing they knew each other.
oh no :( that’s tragic
very well done 👍
quebec should be on permanent utc-4 (eastern daylight time / atlantic standard time) with no time change, and i will die on this hill
[this map is a great visual indicator of the offset of solar time]( 
you can see that montreal is near the central white band of the eastern time zone, meaning that noon on the clock is pretty close to the peak rise of the sun.
using the other examples in the video, percé is much closer to solar noon for at while thunder bay is almost at solar noon for ct, explaining the nearly two hour difference in sunset times. 
some other oddities on that map include france and spain using the aptly-named central european time despite each lying on the prime meridian, and the brutal application of beijing time in western china, resulting in a 3.5 hour offset across the afghan border.
of course this map is demonstrating standard time. where daylight saving time is observed, everyone takes a giant leap towards the red side for later sunrises (and sunsets).
great content. earned yourself a sub
excellent! i had also bought your glasses to watch the eclipse of june 10, 2021. excellent personalized service, thank you again.
i love it when someone explains something unintuitive so clearly.
thank you for taking the time and effort for doing this.
thank you for this video! as a montrealer who has had to travel to edmonton during winter, i must say that being in an office tower and seeing the sun rise on the (mostly flat) horizon well after 8am has made quite an impression on me. edmonton is so dark and cold in the winter mornings, yet so beautiful at the same time...
i always attributed this to edmonton's northern latitude. it never occurred to me that our relative position within our timezones also played a part. 👍
the merit in this video is palpable and substantial.
therefore, on behalf of the montreal reddit community, i recognize your valuable contribution by awarding you this medal of appreciation. 🏅
very well done!  i really enjoyed that and learned a lot!
nice video...   i'm going to keep it handy when debating whether *standard* or *daylight savings* time is the better one to have year round -- no doubt where people live in their timezone affects their opinion!
i'm also an edmontonian living in montreal. thought the same thing! til!
love your content. i also saw your video for the latest eclipse but i had not the strenght of character required to get up at 5am to see the sun be partially hidden behind the moon heheheh
really cool stuff
that’s great! what do you think of daylight saving time then ? according to me it’s a big reason why people hate winter sunsets.
i want to fight to stick with summer time all year long
excellent !!
hahahahahah. our shortest day, i think we get just over eight hours. it’s great if your a vampire or a albino but you also gotta like the cold. like really cold. like why would you live there. it’s too dam cold.
thank you very much!
absolutely agree. time changes also cause an increase in incidence of strokes, heart attacks, and car crashes. down with standard time!!
as a developer i first agree, then remember that everywhere else in the world will still observe daylight savings, leaving me in the same mess.
> some other oddities on that map include france and spain using the aptly-named central european time despite each lying on the prime meridian
from memory, the french (and perhaps also the spaniards?) were in the same zone as the british until the second world war. for logistical reasons, they switched to the cet which was the time of the germans.
ahahahah what a circus esti.
ballarama and his beautiful band of clowns lol
so expected that it's going to be shattered, there will be more drama before d-day i think. to be continued…
ben qu'in.
he got bogged down from a to z in this kind of crazy adventure with holness. not surprised to see him leave, there wasn't much else for him to do after everything that had happened.
i don't take municipal politics seriously most of the time. even then, this election was only a circus. this is exceptional.
> the pressure has been very strong since the announcement of the merger of the two parties, continues mr holness. "i feel like tupac, it shoots everywhere," he said, referring to rapper tupac shakur, assassinated on september 13, 1996 in las vegas.
anyone have inside info / gossip about what happened here?
(apart from the evidence that it was an impossible marriage at the base this fusion between politicians too ideologically different)
music from the office that goes into the background,
jim halpert ?!!
he just destroyed his political career before it even started. good job marc-antoine.
so the merger of the two parties is aborted. mdr what a fiasco.
but it was predictable, desjardins wanted to slow down the decline of french in montreal, holness wanted to accelerate it. it's like, a major point of contention, isn't it? how were they going to come together on this?
a little late to extricate yourself from holness.  balarama is not a serious candidate and desjardins' rep took a hit here
woof. i feel like there is a lot more to come.
(surprised pikachu face)
francophones against referendums? what universe am i in?
when i see this campaign there, i imagine the meme of the dog with the house on fire who says: everything is fine
it is common knowledge that holness is a crosseur, if desjardins was cheap enough to trust him, he only has to blame himself.
the guy didn't realize that lying to his "co-boss" isn't just bad for his relationship with him, but also with the voters.
how to trust holness when he himself betrays his world.
he doesn't think he's a 7-up flat, man.
the same guy who once compared himself to obama. he doesn't seem very sane.
do you know what he is talking about in the referendum at least?
i am interested. do you have any examples of past stocks?
and how can you trust desjardins in the future now that everyone has seen how they got bogged down?
after buying, take a good long look at it while its still new. soak in and enjoy its untarnished beauty. it'll be scratched and dented from life in montréal soon enough.
most stolen cars are the "mass-market" cars, cr-v is #1 i believe.
if i were you i'll be more concerned about the potholes than having the car stolen. that and the hazardous behaviors of other luxury cars owners.
i wouldn't worry, those are very common in montreal generally and parked day and night on the street in most areas.
the real safety issues with luxury cars here are all the knobs that have them and can't drive for shit.
the shitty roads and winter did more damage to my car than any vandalism.
your car won't get targeted anymore than any other unless someone is particularly angry/drunk and is feeling super "fuck the rich" that day.
a stock car from the dealership isn't going to draw any attention, it won't be any more likely to get stolen unless it's one of those very specific cars that get targeted for theft (a lexus gx/lx for example) parked outside overnight is just asking to get stolen.
meh, i had a car stolen and it was the oldest and most banged up in the garage.
you have very little to worry about in montreal. you see tons of em everywhere even exotics in the summer.
i see high end porsche everywhere in montreal and especially downtown, you guys here seem to really love porsche. i've seen quite a few lamborghinis here too, urus in particular several times. high end bmws and mercedes are a regular occurence. 
but of course these cars get damaged by jealous people all the time everywhere in the world, montreal is obviously non exception. you should always be ready for this to happen no matter what vehicle you drive.
as long as you have indoor parking for protection/winter you're fine.
some lexus models are among the most stolen cars in quebec so i would take that into consideration too.
you’ll be fine. you can park it overnight no problem no one will care.
it'll be ok.
you're pretty safe. i'd just be warry of parallel parking downtown because some people literally bump into your car to get out of their spot. get a dashcam, and make it a habit of taking a picture of the car infront and behind you every time you park. sounds hectic but it's literally 45 seconds of your life
it's going to be ok, but if it's going to be your daily commute, it's still gonna wear pretty fast.   
i'd personnaly commute by bike/subway and have a pleasure vehicle for week-ends and stuff.
thieves are targeting toyota and lexus in boucherville
if you get something with low profile tires, be very careful where you drive. i had 11 flats in 5 years. started with 650$/tire and now i buy the cheapest i find, since i have 5 brands of tires in 2 sets...
and don't be surprised if people park touching your car, if you find boot prints on your windshield for some reason... or if people hit it in a private parking at work where you pay 400$/month to park...
besides that, it's awesome :)
wrap your keys in foil, they won’t be able to scan for a car key signal
might be vandalized. cut tires, keyed, broken mirrors. its a common occurrence downtown. outside of it hit or miss. just petty smashed window for whatever. happens to all cars. maybe badges stolen... car thefts happen all over town, no stopping that. a friend of mine in st henri had his audi trashed up pretty good a few years ago.
i've seen cars get dinged up from bikes. mirrors broken off or scratched paint. i've also seen it from cars parking. 
if say it's something not to worry much about but don't be shocked if it happens. parking anywhere on the street you risk damage
if you do get a lease get the damage excess plan..bmw has a good one
sad, the guy was going to retire in 2022 on top of that
:(
it’s a really gnarly section of the river. i would not venture out there in a boat, and doubly not at night.  kayakers and surfers go out there, but they’re super familiar with the place, and they don’t rely on motors to get out of trouble.
what were those boaters thinking, hanging out upstream from there? even looking from the bird sanctuary you can tell those waters are no joke, once you’re in the current, you’re going down, over the ledge and through the waves - if you’re lucky and don’t get shredded in the shallow sections.
those firefighters are very courageous to head out there like that. foolhardy almost. sending a helicopter directly may have been a safer way to handle it.
rip
it's always so sad when a firefighter loses their life.
according to testimonies, it would either be a part of his equipment which would have remained stuck in the structure of the boat or the current which kept him stuck under the capsized boat. what an excruciating ending. thoughts of family and colleagues.
the testimonies of confreres and citizens flock to barracks 64:
[firefighter lacroix's locker at fire station 64] (
that locker picture is heartbreaking. i hope the two rescued boaters put their lives to the best possible use after this.
[removed]
f
well the old saying. firefighters are the only ones running into a burning building. this was the water rescue team as well at house 34 in lachine. they deal with all sorts of water rescues on the st lawrence. iirc we don't have a chopper based sar team locally 
but yes the current is very powerful in that area and up river. maybe the people on the boat had a mechanical problem and drifted down river. i've seen people trying to swim near rene levesque park all the time near the mercier.

sorry i was thinking about 34e av for some reason
if you don't mind hanging out with ancients, i'm always down for a long walk on a nice day!
it would be helpful to specify your preferred area ;)
damn, verdun's too far for this to be practical.
i love long walks, but i don't run so much. i did lots of gyming pre-pandemic, but put that on pause for covid. i also bike a lot. if that interests you, feel free to dm =d
may i recommend the discord server associated with /r/makefriendsmtl/
there are lots of people looking for workout buds.
you could try east laurier running club. not too far from rpp
i've been neglecting exercice since the beginning of  the pandemic, i would love to start with long walks or some hiking!
i tend to do walks around the mount from the mile end
hello :),
the discord of r/makefriendsmtl/ is nice, i'm on it.
i live next to laurier parc and i'm usually out for a run or walk at least 5 times per week (i can't stand staying in for more than 48hr \^\^).
i usually go around petite patrie/laurier/la fontaine by walk during the evening (45min/1h). i run one or two times per week (less than 10 km).
during weekend, when i have the occasion i can sustain bigger walks (up to 5h in the city), usually the goal is to try new pastry places xd.
i won't mind someone to discuss with by doing that \^\^. en francais ça me va aussi.
don't know if you're still looking but i'm down for a workout buddy. i'm even willing to to go to the gym haha. i'm not in bad shape but i completely lost my abs 😅
>my name is virginie, i'm a 29f. my first language is french
so why did you write your post in english?
hey :) thank you!!! ancient????
i am in la petite patrie :)
wow thanks!
wow i love it thanks
hi! you look new on reddit. let me help you: reddit is an english-speaking platform used mainly by anglo-saxon men between the ages of 18 and 35 in technological spheres. like many asian city subs filled with anglo-saxon expats who fit this profile, / r / montreal is no exception.
being an anglo-saxon platform, many french speakers also use reddit to learn english. i hope it doesn't hurt you too much!
fart it will do you good ❤️
disnosaur. fossil.
like a worn out, beaten down couch, ready for the curb
i'm in my 50s. doesn't seem quite so ancient from where i'm standing, but it might do from where you're standing.
i'm in pretty good shape though. i can't run for shit, but i can walk alright. haven't gone for a 20kms walk in a while, but i often do 10-15.
if you had spent a little time on this sub-reddit, you yourself would have noticed that it also speaks french. the over-representation of anglophones and anglo-saxon expatriates is not a justification for acting like a colonized.
we don't talk much about the blue line or the rose during the municipal campaign.
is it because of that this morning to see a-40 e and jarry mega traffic service in lacordaire?
there is very interesting information on the stm website concerning the new stations: [ //www.stm.info/fr/infos/etat-du-service/travaux/future-station-lacordaire)
among other things, the famous expropriated pharmacy / medical clinic will only be used to build a second aedicule. the good news is that at the last news these kiosks were probably going to be removed given the explosion in costs.
i really wish this blue line had gone more north toward montreal north or st-michel would of really help connect them to the rest of the city.
just too late for my studies lool

the caq officially caned the rose for the benefit of the eastern rem (the cdpq has also started the call for tenders today).
sucks to suck.
at least $ 100m has been spent by the plante administration for the pink line fire.
it is overflowing a lot because the pandemic has hurt public transport, but cars are back and even more numerous.
jean-talon and pie-ix are also under construction. it overflows everywhere.
there was a po at this location prior to the start of the blue line discussions.
lord, they've handled the expropriations crooked. stores useful for an entire neighborhood, a shopping center where all families go? no big deal, we're going to act like crazy. i am thinking of center le boulevard among others (where the former owner also seemed to be a not-so-famous sparrow).
fortunately they seem to want to correct things now, it is about time.
yea i still don't get why they have so many of the old cars, how many years has it been since they started the replacement?
the caq had already given its disagreement 4 years ago when it released this as an election promise ...
are you talking about petro-canada? this is the location of the main entrance, here i'm talking about the secondary.
regarding the shopping center, they wanted to expropriate only part of the parking lot but it is the owner who seems to have taken the opportunity to be expropriated in full by going through the courts. but indeed, big fiasco.
regarding the pharmaprix, i understand that the second entrance is useful for buses, but is it really necessary? and why not have it built in the park opposite? the city indicates that it does not want to reduce the green cover, but we could have removed parking lots from this same park to compensate.
it is good news that the quebec government has forced the artm to revise their ambitions downwards, otherwise the costs would explode and we would never have an extension.
i think the new cars don't fit in the blue line tunnel or something.
well, she did her job of trying to convince the government of quebec, which obviously doesn't listen to the experts and doesn't give a damn about montreal.
i mean, poly's mobility chair praises the rose line project in official reports and gets tabletted, because you want plante to do more. it was a magnificent and well thought out project, she wanted to embark the population of montreal in order to force legault's hand but it is too thick. i'm sure she's the first to be disappointed.
no before, there were 2 gas stations around the corner.
indeed the owner wanted to make easy money and he won. makes you sweat.
what is weird for the shopping center is that there is also a maxi / winners parking lot rarely used more than 30%, within 10 steps of the shopping center which was expropriated. a little imagination could have avoided the problem (although i do not know all the details). and to read you, i understand that they also lacked imagination for the pharmaprix.
but hey, artm is not going to destroy the center in the end and it will entrust its management to experts. too little too late perhaps, but at least the district will keep a gathering point and services and the arrival of the metro will greatly increase the attraction, i hope.
i live in one of the fourplexes that i own and i have no issues with tenants.  they are great tenants because i applied the same rules to select them as the bank applies to me when granting a mortgage.
if you become a proprietaire-occupant, you need to run the place like a business.  you don't give out your personal phone.  you don't answer emails off-hours and you don't react to anything until the next business day, minimum.
you are not a tenant's slave.  you are the owner of a business that they patronize and as a business owner there are many ways to offer great service to tenants without you becoming their slave.
the tenants i inherited when i first purchased this place were all deadbeats.  one by one i kicked them out.  none of them paid on time.  don't take shit so you won't have to deal with shit.
having said all this, running a business shouldn't be underestimated.  it still is a lot of work maintaining a building and requires someone with both handyman and organizational skills.
is it me or the article doesn't explain the attraction these “other buyers” would have for 900k plexes with 33k annual revenue? because these investor buyers were non-existent in the last 5 years when the prices were lower. plexes in already well-established working-class neighborhoods were sold almost exclusively to owner-occupiers, while those that needed to be razed were then sold to investors.
imagine the owner who buys this building at 900k $ in which a unit is rented less than 1000 $ per month. do you see the pressure he or she will have to increase this rent, legally or not? speculation is funny on wall street, but it shouldn't be allowed on an asset that is as essential as a house.
never live amongst your tennant's
i don't understand why you're being downvoted. i'm a landlord and everything you said is correct.
my old landlord had the same rules about business hours. it was fun when my apartment got flooded on a friday night and they refused to answer any of my calls or emails until the next monday.
i pm’d you.
as in investor 900k for a duplex making 33 780 (\~1410 a month per rental), that's 26x rents... that's just terrible as an investment, that means that i need to raise rents to at least 60k to break even, good luck finding renters at \~2400  a month, and legally i cant even increase them much.
lets say you put all the money and improvements possible to make that apartments renting at 1400 worth 2400 now...well theirs the next trap within 5 years you will be re evaluated by the city and taxes will be increased to match the new property value, so you just increased expenses again, so a probably not cash flowing anymore.
> lesson learned the hard way but so true. each buyer wishing to be an owner occupant with other units in the building should inquire before embarking on this.
can you elaborate please ? i feel like living with tenants above gives you better control. for exemple a tenant will maybe not do huge noisy parties if the landlord lives below ?
lesson learned the hard way but so true. each buyer wishing to be an owner occupant with other units in the building should inquire before embarking on this.
my recommended way of doing it is, have a property manager have tenant issue be through them and never through you. 
you get to live like an owner with out the rest of the tenants knowing so and if there is a complaint to the pm about you so what its your building. 
yes it costs money for a pm but its peace of mind and you can expense it.
which means plexes go to the real estate speculators.  i'm not sure renters want that either.
this sub is filled with tenants who feel that living in clean, perfectly maintained, functional housing located close to where they work is their "right" and that they should all have equal access to this, regardless of their income, just like they have access to medicare.
of course, this is a complete disconnect from reality.
but tenants often have no first-hand experience with the sacrifices and hard work one needs to make to gather funds to purchase and maintain a property, or that the very government that they count on to somehow miraculously deliver them this housing, is the one that makes it so unaffordable.
for example, tenants don't know about loi r-20 that makes it illegal for me, the landlord, to paint or fix my apartments myself.  they don't know that their taxes are being used to fund a state-run mafia outfit like the ccq that forces me to hire professional painters at ridiculous rates which result in high costs that i'll pass on to them in the next raise.
[
they don't know that the government continues to do nothing about the mafia-like real estate agent associations that enforce a 5% commission "tax" on just about every real estate transaction in this country.  think about this: many buyers today can only gather a minimal 5% downpayment for their homes -- well, that 5% goes directly into the pockets of the real estate agents involved in that transaction.  if a seller tries to avoid this and sell it on his own, this is what happens: [
making a 1400$ apartment worth 2400$ will cost you 100k
plex's are just investment properties. they for people who want extra income to help pay their mortgage while living in one of the units.
they more will complain about eveything little thing, harass you at all hours. send you a text the moment is snows to clean the snow or how the parking situation is bad. throw your lifestyle in your face etc. they'll still have those loud parties.
not sure why my comment is getting downvoted but it's also sorta normal here
i would be curious to know more about your opinion on this?
it's getting to that point. i no longer live amongst the tennants. however i've already started shopping a management company
well no.  until recently, live in landlords actually cared about the property and maintained things.  now they've been priced out and replaced by faceless entities that don't actually care about the property.  end result is far worse conditions for the renter and the creation of slums.
tsé.. because what montréal really needs is griffintown phase 2 par devimco.
> worse still, the consultation process did not bring the desired results, as the cities only retained the recommendations in line with their vision
oh no, the city defends its constituents instead of giving free rein to the slumlords! what a drama! i cry all the tears in my body!
> denis coderre, "the goal [...] is to establish a sandbox where everyone will be seated at the same table," he said.
what kind of fucked up sandboxes does fat coderre want to put in our parks?
the promoters: "it goes without saying that there are still plenty of chinese people who want to buy condos ..."
developers have a large share of responsibility in the present real estate bubble, which makes real estate rentals and purchases too expensive.
after being stuffed by glassy entrepreneurs in the 2000s (corruption of the reign of gerald tremblay), we are now getting screwed by glassy entrepreneurs who know very well that a large part of their condos are sold to figureheads. residing in canada to allow foreign companies and individuals to buy real estate that will remain empty for 10 years before being resold at 400% profit.
more square of mard than a square of sand
i'm surprised it doesn't happen more often.
i think (i could be wrong) the rules are simple for money couriers, if you get attacked you drop the money?
> i'm surprised it doesn't happen more often.
this is because on the one hand, the "risk vs reward" calculation is really bad for this kind of crime and on the other hand, the way this type of crime is designed, it filters the majority of potential criminals: that only attracts criminals with a high potential for violence, those who premeditate their actions (therefore not "opportunistic" criminals and thieves who pass by when the house is empty) and those who are "social" enough to be able to work as a team.
moreover, since the security truck robber knows he will face armed opposition, he must therefore prepare for violence: he must recruit at least one or two other accomplices and he must ensure that all accomplices agree on the same level of violence to use. if one goes "too far" then they are all responsible for murder and will spend 15+ years in it. if one accomplice isn't motivated enough, they could all get caught and spend 10+ years in them. the "acceptable range of violence" is therefore very narrow for successful crime, and then there is the aspect "keeping a secret with many" which is quite another story.
it is also important to note that there is no facebook / yellow pages of crime: these folks are hooking up with those who are available, so that brings up another set of potential problems.
it should also be remembered that the crime will be done in a public place, with potential witnesses and the presence of cameras everywhere. so you have to have masks and disguises, then a change of disguise and vehicles, then a way to destroy the evidence. with modern survey techniques, this is easier said than done!
finally, the loot is not as high as you might think, considering that it is not a "solo" plan so that there must be a split. this sharing can also cause tension, which can lead to getting caught even after a "perfect plan" because of jealousy or other human situations.
in short, in the end it is the risk of spending the majority of your adult life in prison versus the potential gain of a fraction of the contents of the truck, which you simply cannot spend frivolously without getting caught by the cra.

haha yeah in this case is that i had seen an interview with a reformed ex-bank robber who spoke that the prisons were full of guys making time for truck thefts that had gone wrong, so gotta believe that it marked me!
poutine is a full meal at the banquise. not just a snack you can take in between meals. it should either be your lunch or dinner
not to be mean, but bouillon bilk for dinner and then pied de cochon a 10pm… sounds like a lot of food in a short time lapse… bouillon is great, one of my favorite… i wouldn’t want to restrict myself because i have to eat so soon after… and pied de cochon is great, but a lot of food and calories at 10pm… maybe come back when you’ll have a better reservation ?
for your sunday, walk down the mountain and through the mural festival walls, grab a sandwich at les co'pains d'abord (rachel & st-denis), santropol (st-urbain & duluth) or a poutine at patati patata (rachel & st-laurent).
gibbys, why, oh why... it's a steakhouse, probably have better in to.
for more local authentic : pastaga (don't let the name fool you), hogan&beaufort...
you do bouillon bilk and au pied de cochon on the same night? cancel au pied de cochon.
she in old
montreal try olive and gourmando.
it likely won't be quick, as there is often a line-up, but maybe try arthur's on notre dame ouest in st-henri for lunch. 
don't forget bagels at either st-viateur or fairmout!
le 4e mur is a great speakeasy but there is also stilllife (make reservations) and atwater cocktail club. 
one of my favorite things to do in montreal is to catch a burlesque show at the wiggle room (pre-drinks at big in japan bar if it's still open).
omg i'm so excited for you! montreal is a great city for eating and strolling around. bienvenue :-)
>grabbing poutine from la banquise in the afternoon
la banquise does not have a good poutine, despite everyone recommending it.  they have a wide variety with many different combinations and they are open at 3am after the bars close.  la poule mouillee is better, and across the street.  
the croissants at kouign amann are amazing.  they are always hot, fresh from the oven. check the opening hours before going.  
the potato and cheese bread at boulangerie guillaume is addictive.  i usually eat the entire loaf, same day.  get the larger size.  for some reason, the half size does not taste the same.
i think you are trying to do too much within a short period of time. you don't live that far away and some of those meals will be very filling such as the poutine. sunday breakfast i would grab a full english breakfast at burgundy lion pub.
if you are driving.. factor in extra time for 401 being a disaster in either direction.
for a quick lunch before going to the mmfa, i'd suggest cafe aunja.
thanks for all the great comments and feedback! i've added a few stops to our list such as *patisserie au kouign amann* and changed our reservation at bouillon bilk from friday to saturday (bye bye gibbys). can't wait for the weekend!
in the old port i definitely recommend un po di piu - love that place. also second the other user's suggestion of olive & gourmando. 
if you want a quick bite when you get into town parma cafe near by has some good quick eats. 
arthur's is a popular breakfast brunch spot in st-henri was also mentioned and is solid, another breakfast option maybe on your sunday would be le passé composé.
on saturday for lunch, grab a chicken cutlet sandwich with spicy mayo at dispensa on william near mcgill. eat it in the old port whilst enjoying a cold beer.
edit: downvoted by a subway connaiseur. lulz.
if you don't get the kouign amann from patisserie au kouign amann, you will regret it
if you are looking for great food in chinatown try fleurs et cadeaux
re sunday: mount royal's a fairly substantial outing. instead of trying to cram something else in on sunday, i'd suggest committing the day to the mountain (assuming the weather's decent). you'll enjoy the experience more if you're not rushing to get to the next thing.
take the metro to cote-des-neiges on the blue line. pickup take out lunches and some refreshments (there are plenty of options in the neighbourhood). then take 90 minutes or so to check out notre dame des neiges cemetery (the entrance is on decelles, south of queen mary). we've been burying people up there for 250+ years. the monuments, the natural surroundings and the solitude of nddn are (imho) even nicer than mount royal park. it's more romantic too, in case you want to impress the gf with your thoughtfulnes.
make your way to the gate on remembrance road here:
cross the street and check out the park for a couple of hours. if you want to stop for coffee (or need a toilet) in the park your options are beaver lake chalet, smith house and the chalet at the lookout. smith house usually has some neat historic exhibits if that interests you.
from the lookout you can walk down to to the top of peel street and head back to your hotel. follow the promenade fleuve-montagne if you want to check some landmarks out, or go down your own way.
the oratory's just a couple of blocks from cote-des-neiges metro. if you're out in the neighbourhood early enough i suppose you can try to squeeze that in along with your mountain walk. it's pretty damn huge too though. i'd allow two hours to walk to it from the metro, look the place over and walk back to the cemetery entrance.
enjoy your stay.
la maison publique is my favorite restaurant in the world. can't recommend it enough.
the hunting and fishing club is in old montreal and is top notch french gastronomy.
one of the best wine waiters in quebec also works there.
quick tip for gibby’s: if it’s not what you asked for, or the wellington is dry, send it back. don’t let the snotty waiters bully you!
this is my high school, it happened right after the end of the school day. i was in the hallway when i saw him enter the school, i was one of the first teenagers to call 911 while my teachers were doing cpr. i couldn't sleep today
[deleted]
16 year old me used to get off the 161 at that intersection twice a week to go to violin practice. i’d walk back and get snacks from euro-marché in the winter or a drink at the 2nd cup in the summer. 
almost a decade later, and the place is unchanged. same teens and middle aged working people crowding the bus stop, same uncles at the tim’s, same filipino businesses, same hellish traffic because of the parked cars on vh, and i think the robotics banner on the school was still on display recently?
i can’t imagine murder happening there. ngl, this hit different.
wtf is happening to this city? i feel it was never this bad growing up. are the amount of shootings going up, or are we just hearing about them more often because of reddit?
prioritize your own wellbeing and make sure you speak to a therapist. what you witnessed can take years to resolve. you did a great job calling 911. hang in there.
i don't think the city has ever been this bad.
growing up we had biker wars and mob wars, the former leaving well over 100 deaths & a little boy blown up by a car bomb. it seems scarier because of todays 24/7 news cycle.
as i said it was way worse. you just hear about it more now thanks to 24/7 news cycle
it's always the same reddit user that posts the bad montreal news, check his post history
it was much worst, i dont know if you forgot or you simply dont know but montreal was a lot more violent years ago. 
you hear about one crime today and think it's the standard but it isen't, back then it was so common we didnt hear about it unless it was something bigger. now things get reportee more, its good but it gives the wrong impression.
i feel like crying, i know who died, his nickname that everyone called him was twizzy and he was in sec 5. i was with my science teacher and a group of classmates outside when the firefighters and ambulance took him on a stretcher.
oh yes it has and much much worse. we just enjoyed years of calm. who remembers car bombs going off ? i do.
i'm just glad i stayed home today. seeing the homicide unit on a way to workout isnt cool. i'm also the mom of an adult teen male. this stuff horrifies me.
the jeep blowing up an the bumper killing the kid was the turning point not only in the public's eye but also in the field between the groups. it brought negative attention.
it was also way worse for women in the 70s-80s with tons of rape/murder cases and "disparitions" which were in fact murder cases with no suspect.
it was way worst in the 70s.
the number of shooting this year is 4 times what it was in 2016 and much higher than it was during the biker wars.
montréal was the murder capital of canada in the freaking 60s...
good lawd. it’s making scared i ain’t gonna lie.
i don't care, i appreciate his posts (lol i actually checked his post history real quick and i've clicked them all) and as far as i'm concerned i encourage op to keep posting and keeping us informed.
thanks op!
jesus, you're right. multiple posts per day. what's the / u / eric_bousquet problem?
they took him to us. i'm a nurse and i work in the emergency room. i was the first one there when the ambulance brought him to us. we had a huge team of emergency doctors and nurses, cardiothoracic surgeons, respiratory therapists, support workers, admins etc... i guarantee you that we did absolutely everything we could to try and save him.
> the officers were looking for a suspect described as a black 18-year-old man whose height was 1.85 metres, whereas burke stands at 1.70 metres and was 54 years old. burke and the suspect were also wearing different styles of clothing. 
lol, jesus. open and shut case, jean-philippe!
> the judge found auger and théorêt guilty of wrongfully arresting, handcuffing and searching burke; failing to inform him of the motives for their arrest, using excessive force and being disrespectful toward him. 
> 
> mcmahon also said they were "negligent or careless of the health and safety of monsieur burke."
"why don't people like us!?!!"
for the ethics committee to find a police officer at fault, i can't imagine how egregious the facts they were presented must have been. just reading the article makes me angry, and we know the police must have hidden the best.
> "what struck us back when [burke] first contacted us is this phenomenon of jumping on any black person that they could find at the time even if the suspect description just does not match his profile," niemi said.
 > "we want a decision that clearly reflects the principle that black lives matter, and hopefully in this case we will have that." 
i don't remember which sitcom made that joke/observation (i think it's *everybody hates chris*), but there's a scene where a convenience gets robbed and the police asks the owner to describe the perp. the owner goes "black guy, medium complexion, about 6 feet tall and around 170-180 pounds, medium built, he had a tat..." and the mind of the officer goes "black guy, black black black black black black" while the owner gives a detailed description. 
it's a trope for a reason, it happens very often.
funny how /r/quebec doesn't talk about any of this but are the firsts to fight agaisn't any news calling them racist lmao.
as a french canadian quebecer, i've never seen more racist and angry people online and irl
the photo with the labatt dry 7.1% is amazing.
wait - but blanchette and legault said we have no racism problems in quebec?
did they lie to me?
what??? since when????? wtf??????? 
/s
what a surprise. i'm shocked. what will be the next revelation. that we have to breathe to live.
(/ s just in case)
yet again... 
** surprised pikachu face **
i am just here for the comments.
a step in the right direction, but meaningless without actual consequences. fingers crossed.
why is this a surprise? have none of you ever lived montreal?
>sanctions for the officers based on the ethics board decision are expected in the coming months. 
does anyone know what kind of sanction could apply here?
systemic. racism.
whaattttt noo way.....who would have known
i thought it was the beaverton article...
i'm a brown guy, police stopped me and asked me for id because they were looking for a white guy with totally different hair. he even showed me the picture. i tell him that the dude in the picture is white to which he replies you match the clothing description. i was dumbfounded, honestly.
yeah... i'm generally critical of this kind of complaint but it certainly seems warrented in this case.
edit: what the fuck? i said i agree with the guy who complained about this! and by being critical i mean that every complaint should be evaluated on it's own merits without bias.
theres a chapelle joke thats eerily similar.
/ r / quebec is a sub host of identity reactionaries.
if a topic isn't about how quebec is a minority that faces nasty discrimination from english canada, then they're interested in fuck all.
"the quebec police are racist" / r / quebec: * * locusts * *
"a sub streamer accuses quebec of being racist because they are attacked by a group of racist identity quebecers" / r / quebec: * "it's the fucking war, how dare he say things like that about us! we are going to talk about it for three weeks! come on gang, brigadons! "*
"canadians will recognize native lands" / r / quebec: * "ostia that this is pointless and silly blah, and based on false history, damn that sjw wokes go too far" *
"do they even speak real french in quebec?" / r / quebec: * "this is the biggest affront and the most flagrant example of racism and discrimination in our modern society!" *
lol. go to an american city the same size and get back to us
not at all. if we look at the statistics, it is much lower than it was 15-40 years ago.
in another post, a few weeks ago, montreal was the second safest large city on the planet, just behind quebec.
that being said, what i would have liked to see is the number of police officers per 100,000 citizens and compare them with other cities in canada, as they did for the murders.
it stops in 2019 but crime is on the decline in montreal.
not even the most dangerous city in canada.
go to any city in afghanistan and its way more dangerous 🙄
montreal was *way safer* 15 years ago. no comparison.
not on the murder side anyway.
it is even more visible if you go there in homicide per 100,000 inhabitant.
we are at 0.97 whereas 15 years ago it was 1.5+.
indeed .... but gunshots and assaults by street gangs, there were not as many before.
meh, i've never heard a gunshot in the past 10 years in montreal.
if it wasn't media, i wouldn't even know about this "crisis".
so much the better. but, as they say, i have never been a victim of racism in my many years of life, if it wasn't media, i wouldn't even be aware of this "reality" ...
i am white but even without the media am not aware that quebec was even more racist before. just seeing my great-grandparents when i was younger who called me "little nigger". where again the data on poverty / employment from the many canadian censuses.
the data is there. montreal was more dangerous before. the current feeling that there is more violence now is irrational.
> "yes, there is a mobility squad, but it is stuck in traffic". -denis coderre
yes, we miss the coderre era so much when there was no construction, no traffic, no traffic jams. everything was very fluid when he was mayor so he will surely bring that back.
> mr. coderre then accused him of "playing politics at the expense of the victims".
and when someone got puncture, he was content to do nothing, or in forced labor, to force the cyclists to use the sidewalks under the viaducts. problem fixed. he does not make any policy on the backs of his citizens who are being killed (by cars), him! that's not at all what he just did by saying that!
obvious lies, filthy populism and sophisms, denis coderre, the politician, loathes me and i still cannot believe that people want to vote “for him” because it is “against plante”.
it's a bit of a rhetorical question but, what has projet montreal done to these people to make them want to bring tremblay and applebaum's party back to power again ?!
edit: i can't believe it. one person died * while he was mayor * and his “solution” was to keep cyclists out of the way and force them to use the sidewalk. the next administration is building and securing a bike path where this person died, and accuses this administration of playing politics at the expense of the victims! bin kin! worse you ?! aren't you supposed to be doing politics?
speaking of politics on the backs of victims and fallacies, i remember the pittbulls. how many victims of dangerous dogs, denis, for all the regulations and the media? wasn't that politics on the backs of the victims? how many people die from a dog attack in montreal per year, versus pedestrians and cyclists run over / hit by cars and trucks? would legislating against certain types of dogs be more politically profitable than making facilities safer for cyclists and pedestrians? it is clear that denis, him, is not doing that politics on the backs of the victims!
i hope so much that this compulsive liar and hypocrite will lose again and just disappear from public space for good.
coderre has to fire his campaign manager because whoever told him "take over the city" is a good logo is sabotaging him. that sounds so ... cultish.
a despicable character who has been lying to us in the face, without embarrassment, for years. but his campaign is going badly, and i have high hopes that he will be defeated once again. will he finally show us patience after this other defeat?
> they want to bring tremblay and applebaum's party back to power again
[same face, new gang of crosseurs / new face, same gang of crosseurs] (
plante's party siphons off our taxes for projects that only benefit 2 or 3 chou-chou neighborhoods, making access to our city more difficult. there is the montreal de plante and the rest of montreal.
my brother!
indeed, it's pretty blatant to see all these career politicians gravitate and stick around the same group, even if the party changes its name.
and if we do some quick research we can see that there are still several from tremblay's time that are still there and still there.
lionel perez, jean-marc gibeau, michel bissonnet, chantal rossi, alan desousa, aref salem, michèle d. biron, mario battista and lili-anne tremblay are still under the banner of ensemble montreal.
so the progression looks like union montreal -> team denis coderre -> ensemble montreal -> ensemble montreal - team denis coderre.
plus, how narcissistic do you have to be to create a party in your name, leave it after losing, give it time to get a new leader and a new name, then come back and take it over with your name and as the leader again? i'm looking forward to the party name going back to plain and simple "ensemble montréal".
as far as i know, the boroughs and their mayors generally have quite a bit of power, and it is they who decide a good part of the development in their territory. this is why some cycle paths stop suddenly between certain boroughs or even that snow removal is not equal everywhere. some boroughs prefer the policies of ensemble montreal and still elect candidates for this party. they decide a lot of things in their borough. and the residents of the central boroughs who vote for projet montréal also have the mayors and the amenities they want.
the city is terribly decentralized and to my knowledge, it is difficult for the mayor of the city to impose his will on all the districts. especially if they are in opposition.
as for access to the city, i remember that the demolition of the bonaventure expressway was completed while coderre was still mayor. [he posed on this thing.] ( modernite.php) except that to be fair, it is a project that dates from before it was in municipal politics in montreal. he just didn't stop it.
what makes access to our city difficult? what only benefits 2 or 3 neighborhoods? can you point to examples?
soon it will be * "together we are all denis coderre" *
i come from the ste-genevieve - ile-bizard district,
all the requests that my entourage made to the city (clarification of signage on a street which is also a school parking lot), improvement of a dog park, repair of a sidewalk, etc. were answered by "we are waiting for the 'downstream of the mother city'. whereas before the mayor had more power for "small matters".
access to the city? you just can't park anywhere. i left home this summer to cycle on the famous rev that my taxes paid, and no parking space. if i want to take the metro, it's the same thing. i have to go to laval to park.
i liked going shopping on st-hubert or having a drink in town from time to time with my wife. but the shopping is mirabel or carrefour laval, the drinks are ste-anne-de-bellevue or vieux longueil.
i am a computer consultant, my firm charges double the cost of travel for any client who is south of the metropolitan area between décarie and the 25.
the first point on local management, which does not go back well, does indeed seem to be something to improve for projet montréal. it must be conceded, that seems their weak point.
on the other hand, for access to the city, i do not understand how we can blame valérie plante directly, or projet montréal. it's a big city question. are you going to tell me that the car goes well in toronto or boston? that new york is not eliminating parking lots for bicycle lanes? especially since you are only talking about parking and cars.
the parking situation around metro stations was the same under coderre. did you expect projet montreal to expropriate land around metro stations to make more parking? how is this situation plante's fault? did coderre promise to do more park-and-ride parking near subways and allow people to park their cars there?
the work on plaza st-hubert is not project montreal. they were planned before valérie plante was mayor. [they were planned by the société de développement commercial de la plaza, * under denis coderre *] (
> "i am happy to announce that my administration will invest approximately $ 50 million to rebuild the infrastructure of plaza saint-hubert, redevelop the street and replace the marquee, which was in dire need of it. we are going to restore plaza saint-hubert to its nobility, propel it into the 21st century and offer montrealers a pleasant living space and a unique and attractive shopping experience. "
> -denis coderre
then the argument of "my taxes paid this and that and i cannot go there by tank", must be done anyway. we live in the same city. my taxes also pay for that and i'm fine with me. it clearly goes to a lot of the other citizens who pay for it as well. they even vote for it. do you want to. lots of other people pay taxes. your taxes do not give you more weight in another borough where citizens vote to spend them on something else. it has nothing to do with it. i have no children and i know very well that i have to pay for the education of the children of others. i take advantage of it otherwise.
the same goes for the rev. [the counters show that the track on st-denis is popular] ( -reseau-express-velo-cartonne.php). if that gets fewer people to use their cars, it creates less traffic and requires less parking. even if the rev itself removes parking, it is especially in residential areas on bellechasse. st-denis street retained most of the parking lot but lost one lane of traffic in both directions. the fact remains that according to the citizens and the people of the surroundings, it is indeed a success for them. even if you can't get there by car.
and then mobility parenthesis. the deux-montagnes commuter train could have brought you and your bike closer to the rev, if it was still in operation. however coderre and charest gave the line to the cdpq to build a light rail there. it was denis coderre himself who made the announcement.
> [on april 22, 2016, the mayor of montreal, denis coderre, and the ceo of the cdpq, michael sabia, announce a mega-project of slr called réseau électrique métropolitain (rem)] ( / wiki / r% c3% a9seau_express_m% c3% a9tropolitain # r% c3% a9seau_% c3% a9lectrique_m% c3% a9tropolitain)
you will be able to use the rem to get to the rev in a while. in the meantime, from the west, it is also possible to take the vaudreuil line commuter train. on the other hand, the north-south cycling facilities of the towns in the west of the island unfortunately leave much to be desired.
and then, from a person who sometimes makes the trip by bike, crosses ddo following de salaberry then crosses bois-de-liesse. super nice bike path in the park. then follow gouin, there is a cycle path practically the whole way. it'll bring you to rev on lajeunesse / berri in ahuntsic. it takes about 1h15 from ste-geneviève. it's easy to make a round trip in a few hours.
but if you absolutely want to come and try a bike path (which you partially paid for! 1! 1) with your car, wouldn't it be possible to park it in a park or a public parking lot? like the parking lot at parc du bois-de-liesse? or private parking? has valérie plante removed the parking lots at complexe desjardins? were those at the central station full? it is not possible to park in angrignon?
but i think about it, your plan to try the rev, from ste-geneviève, was to put your bike on your car, drag it to a metro, park there, take the metro with your bike to a station near the rev to be able to try it? did you intend to ride a bike in the story?
so, what would you expect from valérie plante and projet montréal for "access to the city"? what should they have done to get your vote? and what could denis coderre do to improve access to the city and rectify all that if he is elected? was it easier to travel under coderre? weren't the boroughs putting in one-sided ways and appeasement measures even though coderre was in power?
1st point - these requests never had to go back to the mother city, they are local requests, it is just since projet montréal has been in place that this is the case
2nd point - the st-hubert plaza and access to the city. what i am complaining about is not that i cannot drive into town, it is that intermodal arrangements are not being made. it's all well and good to have a metro, but you have to get there, the same goes for the commuter train and the rem. the parking lots available to get to the city are full and the city has chosen to narrow them down and prohibit parking nearby. in addition, they keep trying to block the eastern rem, which would help enormously in reducing congestion in montreal.
3rd point - the rev. the smart thing would have been to join him to the long tracks of the west island. let's say along gouin (which has no bike path west of the 13) or along lakeshore.
my plan was to take my bicycle but it's a bit suicidal gouin between pierrefonds and the 13.
i would have taken the bus, but not the right.
to keep my vote, projet montreal would have had to:
1. decentralize power as much as possible
2. increase fund transfers to the boroughs
3. tackle the real problem of the housing crisis
4. either facilitate access to the city center or stop breaking our bikes by telling us that we must go back.
i spoke at length to the two candidates who came
"artists" graffiti artists. sorry but balloon letters i find it hideous compared to a beautiful urban work.
[deleted]
the main reason i got into graffiti when i was younger was because i saw society as something that was owned by a small group of "rich people" who talked down to the rest of us through advertising and propaganda. i thought it unfair that only the few who could afford the ad space could have their opinions heard in the public sphere. i started putting up stickers, stencils, posters inside bus shelters, painting walls, trains etc... i was "bombing the system" by putting up my own messages. i wanted to show that it's not just the rich and powerful who have a say, but anyone who puts their mind to it and takes a bit of risk can be heard. after some years i got quite good and was painting professional murals and creating fine art and installations with the same mind set. but as popularity for murals grew, the messaging behind them quickly became friendly only to those who are funding them. apart from some festivals that grant artistic freedom like under pressure, the artist usually becomes a human printer at the service of public and private clients who just want to make a surface look pretty or be part of a trend without offending anyone. there's nothing wrong with making walls look more pretty, but to me, those murals, no matter how well executed they are, are often so boring i don't even notice them. but that's what you have to paint if you want to be at that level. if your work contains a strong message that is critical of corporate culture, you're probably not going to have corporate clients lined up around the block for your work (obviously) and when you make your living painting murals like in my case, that meant having to hide the message cleverly or just work as an artist assistant to other muralists and either not sign the work, or sign under a different name. graffiti is also boring too as it has become so deliberately terrible as to disassociate itself from mainstream public art that it's painful to look at without cringing. now we're in a situation where we have muralists consisting of former graffiti writers, painting commercial friendly murals getting crossed by the new generation of graffiti writers who see it all as a bunch of advertising and propaganda, because it pretty much is. even murals which critique the corporate system are crossed since they're created under the same commercial umbrella and are seen as part of the problem. going after the graffiti writers risks having all your murals destroyed in minutes by people who have nothing to lose. i've even had a fine art installation at hec crossed out by someone i've never even met. but that's what graffiti writers do, they attack the system. they write on what they can reach. unfortunately they have very little to say other than "fuck you" to the person who's nearest to them, even when that person is one of the only ones who might understand them most. considering the consequences of getting arrested, i find it disappointing to see how many writers still take that chance to paint the same old corny throws and tags like it was 1996 and act like they're "keeping it real" or that they're the first to do it like them. 
anyway, as long as it's fun to break the rules and you have lots of young people who have nothing to do, you're going to have a graffiti problem and no amount of buffing, mural painting, obstructions, or silicone anti-graffiti coating will make it go away.
[a good example] ( on bélanger.
> thank you for respecting the artists
> this mural was made by young people from the saint-michel district
(with a logo "no aerosol can" for illiterates)
the report is extremely well done. he gives voice to both camps and has a scientist who has studied the phenomenon ... rad's gang really have the turn!
taggers hurt the image of our city, i don’t know why we put up with it. if the only thing you have to contribute is your name in lowercase letters over a work of art, maybe it’s time you re-evaluate what you’re doing with your life. 
why montrealers are content to ruin works of art and shop fronts, i'll never understand.
i felt the same way about graffiti tags until i realized that there is no functional difference between someone's fugly spray-painted name and most outdoor advertisement. they all serve the same purpose -- capture eyeballs for brand recognition.
in fact, i consider graffiti more benign than ads because ultimately pressure-washing walls helps keep the city clean of grime. plus, taggers aren't trying to rent space in my head to buy their stuff, so they are probably the lesser of two evils -- one of them just happens to be normalized.
i still find it funny about taggers who don't like murals taking up the space of their tags, when their tags were not more desired by the owners.
i understand loving the adrenaline rush and the whole anti-establishment side and everything and everything, but hey, to each their own way of being an anarchist i guess. if at least they were just tagging big business buildings or whatever, but "tackling" absolutely everything, that's where it just becomes a nuisance, not a stance.
criminals whose avowed goal is just to do illegal things to visibly piss off people. it is high time that the spvm carried out targeted operations to catch them.
because they are cellars.
i knew a lot of people in high school who did that, they were all real idiots who wanted to think they were badass and found excuses to justify that it was not just vandalism. without exception they were putting out some really stupid stuff to explain that it's part of the art to do it without permission, or that it wasn't fair that some people could decide what to do with a wall (like ... it's not just that a wall that we must all see belongs to someone in particular?), etc.
my wife and i went to lisbon several years ago. this city is by far one of the most beautiful and historic in the world but it, like montreal, is completely marred by the presence of graffiti. there is one every two feet on something that otherwise might have been appreciated for its beauty. for me, these "taggers" must be caught and the consequences of their actions should be very severe to discourage them. if they have a talent, let them show it by creating a masterpiece in a deprived corner of the city, but signing and re-signing their nickname does not embellish anything.
there are not enough pig tags
like dogs urinating to demarcate their territory
i find that there is a lack of acab tags in montreal. i think police brutality issues would be better resolved if there were 3-4 more acab tags
great video. i'm always so disappointed in the lack of nuance or understanding whenever this conversation comes up, so it's nice to see the reporting go into a bit. 
i get not liking tagging (especially in this context) but just burying your head in the sand and refusing to understand why it happens is dumb and childish.
both are rubbish, it's better to just break stuff.
if we sum it up, graffiti artists want to fuck up the shit. they have an anarchic and claiming side. then what they have to understand ... is that they are paying the city to erase them. i imagine that one day, there is one who will get caught by another and get screwed in the face ...
monke, a little out of the way! murals are not just in montreal. all the big cities where i have traveled and lived have the same problem.
lets be honest here, there are a lot of really awful murals. montreal is going overboard with them if you ask me. the motto for most murals in montreal seems to be: colours and shapes, just fill the wall with colours and shapes. there is rarely any connection to the neighbourhood or space that it is taking up, its all just completely random crap. we are forced to look at these massive artworks every day, in my opinion more consideration should be taken with each mural.
because they are garbage people.
i share david meren's opinion. i think that to recognize that the territory of montreal was occupied by nations a few decades before its foundation is a good thing, it allows to make a historical reminder and to promote reconciliation (even if in the case of the canadian, it is purely to gain political points), but if we do this recognition, it is imperative to recognize the two other nations that claim to have inhabited the island, namely the algonquins and the hurons. in the case of the algonquins in addition, we know that they knew the territory of montreal very well when champlain came.
symbolic gesture with nothing concrete to help these people.
an empty gesture...very neo-liberal and so freaking shallow.
brown imperialism good white imperalism bad.
the problem is that the archaeological record proves that no one except the algonquins of the st. lawrence, an extinct tribe, lived in montreal. worse still, according to the historical register, it was the mohawks who would have exterminated them.
> reconciliation
i don't like the recent use of this word. reconciliation is bilateral, it goes both ways. what we are seeing is autoflagellation.
yes but you don't understand the idea behind.
who are their friends? arrows in the ground, well, that's not enough to help the cause. the facts are not important here, there. but have you thought about the emotion?
and who are their friends?
and that's how history is written.
but this story is very progressive they say. so it is. with the feathers in the ass and the whole orchestra.
> i think that to recognize that the territory of montreal was occupied by nations a few decades before its foundation is a good thing
it's super disputed and historically inaccurate. but hey ... the wokes are damned factual
i thought the hurons came from the great lakes region?
the hochelagians were killed by disease and either by the hurons or the mohawks, but they took refuge among the three nations according to ethnohistoric studies. this is why the three nations claim that their ancestors inhabited the island.
uh, didn't viel get killed by the hurons in ahuntsic?
if memory serves me well, i learned that at school.
it's not disputed at all that the st. lawrence valley was inhabited by the st. lawrence iroquois, what are you talking about?
indeed, but archaeological studies have allowed us to know that they beat the iroquoians of the st.lawrence west of lake saint-françois (~ 60km west of montreal), which is why they may have -being beaten hochelaga too.
the territory was visited temporarily by several nations, if i remember correctly a study, there were fishing camps on the south shore.
most of the tribes encountered by champlain will tell him that the adsl died in battles with the haudenosaunee league and mainly the mohawks. the traces of pottery found in excavations prove quite conclusively that nothing of the adsl culture remained among the mohawks (or elsewhere) and the slavery of war thesis is more likely than the refuge.
father viel drowned! they had tried to cross overly strong rapids.
what many seem to repeat (not to feel bad) is that the island of montreal was not inhabited when the europeans were conquered.
what i was able to learn in my history lessons is that the region was inhabited and used by the three amerindian clans, and that the island was mainly used as a place of gathering and exchange (barter). also, given that the amerindians were mostly nomadic peoples, it seems easy to me to claim that they do not reside in this or that place.
in short, these negative reactions to reconciliation measures seem strangely similar to those that surfaced during the rise of feminism, which can be explained by insecure individuals who feel guilty and / or attacked.
> the traces of pottery found in excavations prove quite conclusively that nothing of the adsl culture remained among the mohawks (or elsewhere) and the thesis of war slavery is more likely than the refuge.
do you have a link, i would be interested in reading more
i think i'll go fishing at paps tonight (we're going to go fish anyway: p) ~~ and check the plaque again .. i'm sure i've seen "by the huron wicked" or something similar on the monument plaque ~~
edit: 
> the story of the drowning of father récollet nicolas viel and his apprentice ahuntsic in the saults (rapids) of rivière-des-prairies. in our toponymic column today, i will explain where the name sault-aux-récollets and ahuntsic come from.
excuse my ignorance, but i don't understand the meaning of the word "rushed" on the plate, the only meaning i find there is "that they (ahuntsic and viel) were rushed (rushed, pushed a) into the rapids and thus drowned dead
if anyone else has details, don't you hesitate.
> in short, these negative reactions to reconciliation measures seem strangely similar to those that surfaced during the rise of feminism, which can be explained by insecure individuals who feel guilty and / or attacked.
well yes ... you should educate yourself properly before taking on secondary 3 style silliness.
yes i will send it to you later i must start working, no time to find them right now.
isn't there a legend also attached to this story? that if you walk by the edge of the river at night, you can see someone completely soaked sitting on the bank?

i wonder if he knows how to lear.
greasy. so, so greasy.

seriously i think it's a requirement to fall into that category.
*the* king lear
while of course i want a park, i don't think that $700m is going to happen any time soon. 
what i'd like to see as a stop gap is to sell the land to someone with the provision that some percentage of it be used for a park. i have my doubts that we could necessarily recoup the entire investment, but i'd bet people would take condos over an open trench any day.
being near numerous metro stations and being generally well served by local businesses, it is a good way to use now useless land.
napkin calculations show that at about $4k per sq m, jean talon to sherbrooke could sell for $500m, possibly more as there are few huge empty lots near metros still available. factor in the increased tax revenue from the useful land, it could very well be feasible. not to mention of course how awful an open highway is just awful for residents for health and wellbeing.
it would be easier to tarp over the decarie expressway than to tarp over coderre's ego.
i was beyond sick of this asshole the last time around. having him pop back up and seeing his name back in the news is like some stephen king jack in the box shit.
i would much rather use those funds to induce demand for public transit and bike travel in areas that have been designed for cars. and by that i mean neighborhoods, not an important structural addon to the highway. you'd probably get a much better pay off than you would with a $700m bandaid.
why does coderre love combining highways and parks?  he just comes off as someone who has never set foot in a park...
that travesty on bonaventure is only enjoyable when traffic is closed off...who wants to sit in a narrow park surrounded by 4-6 lanes of car traffic?
another project for coderre? got there, what, 395 projects ??
i just want to say that's this proposal has been out for a week already and coderre's party still hasn't updated their plan to reflect the image, or the image to reflect their platform
literally, the part he says he wants to cover is the part left uncovered in the photo.
how is it cult mtl picks up on this and la presse and the gazette don't?
crazy idea! why would qc gov elate the west end ........open cavendish build more metro stations to west island if anything for west end. fix our roads for fuckes sake! the metropolitan is about to have a disaster coming soon . you ever look at that concrete that so shoddy on the met? crappy mafia construction. infrastructure is key .
even if it doesn't recoup the entire investment it would at least reduce the amount of air pollution coming off the highway and into cdn.
sorry, am i understanding correctly that you want to sell the space over the expressway and leave covering + building on top to the owners? that's a massive can of worms engineering-wise, and probably a very bad idea. 
it's not impossible to build over a trench/tunnel, but the last thing we want is a grab bag of private developers doing the bare minimum and not being around in 30 years when things are falling apart, or closing the highway on hundreds of separate occasions for all kinds of construction and inspection. 
just developing the requirements and coordinating things to make sure construction follows those requirements would cost the city a pretty good chunk of the sale price. 
plus the price of covering being built into the sale price of these homes means nothing would be affordable. a condo that costs $500k normally would probably cost double just from the cost of all the other work going into it.
imo until the blue bonnets project gets completed i don’t see the cost being feasible, after completion though it’s certainly possible!
someone needs to figure out how much co2 could be captured and scrubbed clean if the whole trench was covered over.
in fairness, this would be on top of the expressway, and he did say that he wants to reduce traffic lanes on either side of the park. i don't think that's actually feasible, because if i recall correctly, the surface roads are three lanes not including the ramps and the inner lanes have parking. 
i'd take park over exposed highway trenhc any day.
that said, the image coderre is using shows the queen mary to cote-ste-catherine section as open, not covered. he goofed.
exactly!
one guess would be that the gazette will endorse coderre and don't want to throw too much shade on him.
and the noise, and the general ugliness/scar.
maybe noise pollution but the air will still be transferred through ventilation structures.
how? the covered sections would need to be ventilated and end up right back on top. 
it will help with noise and general beauty of the area. although decarie on both sides is pretty shit in terms of 'beauty"
as far as engineering goes, its a matter of getting the plans and ensuring they follow through on it. the engineering work would be at the expense of the developer and the requirement for the government would be for confirming their work both in their calculations and on the job site. you don't just give them carte blanche to do whatever. the government can set the building standards and validate the work before the construction above.
it's also not the first time something like this is done. this is similar to the hudson yards project in nyc (similar in size) where they built towers over a passenger rail yard. being the owner of the land, they have an incentive to build it to last.
is the financial incentive there now? i don't know, but it will at some point and i don't want to see us try holding out for a $700m park.
they've already built buildings over the ville marie - the cdpq office is over a section that was once exposed and open. ditto the palais des congres. and a park was built over it as well, recently, place des montrealaises.
hopefully they can be done in tandem with a comprehensive transit plan! i vote for electrifying the lucien l'allier train to at least montreal west and running frequent small, fast trains, finishing cavendish and running a high quality bus service from st-laurent till that train.
drink driving maybe. then just leave the car and when cops knock on your door: "wait what?!? my lambo should be in the garage!!".
ferris bueller's night off
lol someone bought a little joy ride
i can't wait for it to happen at kenny you hen
it's going to be hard to find the owner. / s
he didn’t kill anyone.. could be drunk driving and leaving b4 police arrive or actually stolen car, could also be insurance fraud
there’s a lambo dealership like 5 minutes from there. it was probably a rental or a company car
i was waiting for someone to post it,
this is what the west island has become bunch of rich spoiled yuppies
"hello ossifer, i sink someone stole my lam... \**hick\** ...  lambogini. i sink it was blue"
lol now you guys post it ? this happened like 2 days ago
i was a little hot
technically not montreal. ;) the spot where this happened is right at the borders between ddo, pointe-claire and dorval – all three of them being de-merged cities.
i've seen worse ... drunk guy turn his tank upside down in a pit not far from his house, walk to his house, sit on his front balcony with a crate of beer and hold a few and wait for the police. he says he lost control of his tank on an empty stomach and drank afterwards.
the police can do nothing about it because by drinking after the accident he contaminated the evidence. he just had a report for leaving the scene of the accident.
even if you can't prove the dui, doing this would still be criminal in many ways
insurance fraud
making a false report
interfering with an investigation
leaving the scene of an accident
dangerous driving
not to mention the dui itself which is harder to prove
*do ya think so?* /s
or bin take a * devious lick * at the scene of the accident
i roared with laughter 😂
i know him and he just had the tank and put it up for rent
it was 1-2 in the morning
as if it wasn’t before…?

if everyone goes outside and puts breeze in cane at the same time it should be less worse
welcome to east montreal! there are a bunch of smelly factories, refineries and the famous sewage treatment plant, but we stay there because it's the last place where houses are affordable. i also wonder why?
to have been caught in traffic by car, behind one of these trucks, it is indeed an absolutely putrid smell, impossible to describe. it's been maybe 15 years ago, and i haven't forgotten about that 5 minutes of horror!
so this factory was there almost 100 years ago, and people moved into the area knowing full well the factory is there, and probably paid a cheaper price for the house as a result. if indeed sanimax isn't respecting whatever standards now, thats on them. but, like the asphalt factories in montreal-est, there's nothing to be done, then its on the nearby residents.
these residents stand to profit immensely if they manage to get the factory to close down or move.
having visited the interior of this factory for work, i can assure you that the outside smell is like a little beer compared to what you smell inside. the show is special.
this was already the case in 2017 ...
better yet, une usine de febreeze to cancel it out checkmate
you just got my vote for the municipal elections
neighborhoods east of many cities around the world are like this, mainly because of the winds. the industrial revolution ensured that the bourgeoisie settled in the west, before the winds of the polluting factories. the plebs lived in poor neighborhoods after the factories (eg: pre-olympic east london, paris seine-st-denis).
it is the same in mtl, even stronger because of the presence of mount royal in the west.
it seems to me that there is no more refinery. there is just one petro-chemical plant left, but the large refinery near the lafarge quarry has not existed for a long time.
i drove these trucks there for a few years. imagine running that liquid all over you while you practice doing your trailer inspections.
the worst part of all this is that it is just fresh viscera that it has not even been 2 hours since it came out of the animal. i have already transported viscera that it has been lying around in the sun in summer for 4 days. i had had difficulty eating pork for a week.
when my friends wonder why i changed careers, i show them a video where one of my coworkers opens a garage door, and a river of blood comes out like in the shining.
it stinks of damn that factory there. from time to time, it smells as far as pointe-aux-trembles and laval. i don't know exactly what they do, but it seems abnormal to me to inconvenience people 5 or 10 km away.
actually lots of people moved to that area because it was cheap due to the refineries, quarry and rendering plants. my uncle and his family did because it was half of laval in the 70s
if you would have read the article, you would know that
> in june 2021 and 2018, the municipal court of montreal found sanimax guilty of polluting the air and water, deploring its “passivity” and the lack of credibility of its witnesses.
and
> according to the registry of lobbyists, the company wants to "avoid having to comply with current standards", deemed incompatible with its activities.
they want to avoid paying money, period. like any company that pollutes.
also, it was established 84 years ago. what was good 84 years ago isn't necessarily what is good today. it's for sure the area was a lot less dense. but anyways, it's in the ghetto and people *choose* to live there, right? so let's just forget it because it's not *our* problem!
😂
i am the plebs .....
edit: suncor's refinery.
do you have the video you can share with us?
but you all knew that before moving into the area...
ah indeed i forgot that one. it is the only refinery that remains.
pink camo pants?
without a leader who's willing to stand up to the police union, we're only ever going to see slow, small progress on this. which is *really* sad because i think police reform could be a big quality of life improvement for the city, while also saving money. 
ideally the police themselves would be interested in reform, but i guess if that was the case we probably wouldn't need it in the first place.
could we start by hiring and training some normal people to operate the traffic lights and direct traffic when needed? the thought of paying douchebags with guns and bad attitudes $75/hr each to stand around and push a button every rush hour turns my stomach. i stopped paying to ride the tour de l'isle when i learned the biggest line item in velo quebec's expenditures was overtime for the police.
body cams and fines no longer go in the city coffers would be steps forward.
don't even need to read it: it will look like it does right now because city hall doesn't want to get into a fight with their tax collectors.
100% this!
the police union is the one giving them a poor image. zero accountability (since they know the commissaire deontologie will never charge them), zero respect for the uniform (remember camo pants?) and zero consequences. there’s nothing for montreal police to be scared for when they abuse powers and/or break laws themselves. it’s a shame the police have such a crooked union. until they go, there will be no support or improvement for our officers or the spvm as an organization. 
hope a future mayor will take action to fix the issues and face the police union

intervention of the water rescue team in progress - 75th ave and lasalle
how the fuck did they capsize? rfibs are supposed to be extremely hard to flip, especially the rescue ones.  i have met people who have claim to have taken them out it 40ft high seas.
there is also this video which shows the situation.
this martin was found. he was trapped in his boat which sank at the start of the rapids.
the firefighter has been found under the boat... no word on their condition but doesn't seem good...
what kind of boat do they use?
police divers and a tow boat pulled the drowned firefighter and the service boat in which he was a prisoner out of the water.
[
later tonight? that might be too late.
they should seriously make a public announcement and ask drone owners to land a hand with the rescue.
they'll have a blast and if they can save a life, that'd be a win-win situation
[deleted]
hi there! saw the boats from up close and met the great people manning these vessels. selfless people with great intentions. unfortunatly, very little training is given for the white water rescue part of their contract. next to little knowledge is given to these people about the lachine and sainte-catherine rapids and the surrounding currents
hammerhead rescue boats.  they are specially made for rescue operations in rough waters and are used by fire and police all over.
of course the lachine rapids are \*extremely\* dangerous and rescuing people there is a very high risk operation, specially after sunset when you have no visibility.  we lost one boat there during training a few years ago (nobody was hurt).
it was a no drone zone they had 2 helicopters above the scene (sq and armed force).
that really pisses me off honestly. it seems to be a common theme here. save people lives? great, we will pay you less then a cashier at the saq and give you shit working conditions/equipment.
somehow i am shocked but not at all surprised.
i would really, really hope that their life-vests are equipped with a knife -- these should be standard issue for anyone going into rapids, they certainly are for recreational white-water paddlers.  getting trapped under a boat (presumably in the rigging) sounds like a terrible way to go, i feel bad for this firefighter.
>next to little knowledge is given to these people about the lachine and sainte-catherine rapids and the surrounding currents
with the construction of the seaway, we lost the know-how of the inhabitants of sainte-catherine and the mohawks of kahnawake, who knew the rapids very well.
if you only knew how many people without life jackets i see trying to pull them up.
i’m surprised they don’t use rib bots like military and coast guard operations.  some of those zodiacs are even self-righting
it also looks like rosborough boats that make that boat have military grade rib models.  the hammerhead is probably a decent boat but montreal’s needs are pretty extreme.  it’s very big water that the average canadian wouldn’t appreciate until seeing it.
those who know the rapids know how dangerous they are. sometimes i see people in boats that are not at all adapted, without a life jacket and it only takes a second to capsize and drown.
if i'm not mistaken, the speed is around 2m / s in the rapids.
it will blow, but for me it is on the contrary a big "red flag"
in the other surprising news:
* the water is wet
* the canadiens are more popular than the cf montreal
* people play spikeball in the parks in the summer
* more than it snows more than there is snow
hey that's a cr \ * sse of good news ...... especially for housing .... 🙄

one of the reasons why i don't vote for him ...
“no problem” the good denis
they know they can easily "negotiate" with him.
a small envelope during a private meeting off the ledgers (because he had stopped keeping the ledger) and voila, everything is approved.
i had no idea spikeball was a thing until today.
i wonder how much it costs to "negotiate" with the right coderre. if it's not too expensive, i'd like it, too, to slip him a little twenty piass so that he approves small projects.
you don't go to the parks too much i guess?
i am amazed, considering that several flights from montreal are currently on the ice, including from yul-shanghai
[removed]
i am not against.
does it look like it's just back to normal and that flights existed before covid?
"we announced today **the resumption of non-stop flights to delhi**, india, following the lifting of the government of canada restrictions"
lame, id prefer montreal to bombay :/
it's still 16 hours of flights !!
to go, i would take a minimum business seat.
india has a 20% vaccination rate (i know it is rising very quickly) and a population that reaches almost 1.4 billion with extremely densely populated cities with poor sanitation (even if it is improving quickly) if we get them. compares to cities in developed countries and even those of many developing countries. i hope the vaccine is effective enough to prevent direct importation of the variants.
lmao

> i am not against.

> does it look like it's just back to normal and that flights existed before covid?
they were banned until very recently...
there were direct flights between delhi and toronto / vancouver before the suspension last spring, but this is the first time that there have been direct flights between montreal and delhi.
great. maybe you won't benefit much from this flight then?
yes i think biz or 1st class is worth it for flights this damned long...
this is the same time that it takes mtl-gaspé by bus in total discomfort, and there are no other alternatives than the plane which costs the same price as mtl-paris. and still lucky that pal airlines took over, because air canada flushed the gaspé. when will the train return to service?
do you have any idea of the price ...
[removed]
you’re very sensitive
i will, one stop in delhi, hopefully the domestic terminal are in the same buildings and off to bom
1st class is like 8k + to india ....still worth it?
according to kayak, departure on december 5 for 2 weeks in business: $ 4,423 (13h flight):

otherwise, $ 1,000 with 2 connections and 50 hours of travel:

chaipo you, but the covid is a bit important, is it really the time to increase international flights? especially to countries with an inadequate vaccination rate? tell me which part of my comment is ill informed and half baked it would make me happy to go to bed less silly at night.
corporate virtue signalling at its finest
are they still going to play the national anthem that says canada is the land of our ancestors?
it should be noted that their press release was all wrong ... the mohawks arrived in the region after the french settlers. it is not the montrealers who live on unceded mohawk land, it is the mohawk reserves that are on land that has been ceded to them.
of course, pc culture never had anything to do with fact or truth.
the organization of the montreal canadiens insults montreal and quebec as a whole with these lies.
finally more politics in hockey
"so... should we go?"
"oh, no, no."
"so some of the money from the ticket sales is going to indigenous communities?"
"well, no."
“so is the money from the bottled water sold here going to first nations for clean drinking water?”
“no, that money goes to nestlé”
what an aberration
the cbc got this one right lmao
i see plenty of people losing their minds over the most minor of gestures once again. “omg this disturbs my hockey viewing so much”  🙄
i remember when people complaining incessantly about everything they didn’t like were considered ginormous babies.
i'm not invested in this at all either way - i'd much rather see concrete policies to help first nation communities than this type of symbolic gesture but i'm also totally fine with it - but what happens if the acknowledgments start to get booed by rowdy fans? i don't think they thought this through.
and what are they doing to make the land fair?
who cares? it is all part of damage control by the canadiens to make people think the team has honor. how can this team be respected in any way after they drafted a player that shared child porn with his teammates?
drop logan mailloux and i will begin to respect this team.
land claims of the mohawks are extremely weak from a historical perspective but , if this is to happen can it replace national anthems? 
its just horrible to watch people go through 2 performative pieces before i can watch hockey.
it is an empty and selfish gesture, but it is done everywhere else.
if that can just spare us an “ah ha !!! everyone does it except in montreal !!! racist quebecers !!! ” so i am for it.
it looks like i made the right decision in cancelling cable and not bothering with a subscription to the nhl. goodbye canadiens, good luck.
the video game company blizzard turned me against them years ago for that same reason. pro blm and pride all over the place, but oh the chinese ccp is making us big money. gotta protect our audience against hearing about the hong kong protest.
i give the habs no brownie points for this.
> corporate virtue signalling at its finest
"the land acknowledgment marks the first of several initiatives the canadiens will be unveiling throughout the year to support indigenous communities."
> corporate virtue signalling at its finest
it's definitely virtue signaling, but it will also serve as a means to raise awareness. i was at the game on saturday and felt the same way you did until the boy sitting next to me asked his grandfather what this was about since he recognized the word "mohawk" but didn't understand the rest. baby steps, i suppose.
they will change "goodbye" to "old buddies"
guess it's time to play locals like they did in the midsummer day victory
they will replace him with the boys of eric lapointe
there's a bit of an induced demand "if-you-build-it" situation. if you did run a frequent bus service shadowing the metro overnight, there would probably be a lot of people that could find it useful. with a reliable transit alternative, you could probably convince a fair number of shift workers to give up cars they currently consider an absolute necessity.
but it would take a long time for people to make that switch, and initially you would probably see pretty low ridership. and at a time of huge budget shortfalls for the stm, with service reductions likeliest in the short term, it's incredibly difficult to justify speculative routing in the hopes that ridership will eventually justify that capacity.
it's been a while since i took the night lines (i made it old and flat), but from memory, they work with limited stops ...
the frequency is really not there for example ... it's a shame that the technical limitations around the maintenance of the metro do not allow me 24 hours
i started to take the night buses, and frankly for some trips it is really efficient. as they are often not very full and with little traffic, i now have some routes where i prefer to take the bus than the last metro. the transit app also greatly helps to improve the experience.
but it's not everywhere. when you have to make a transfer, it gets a lot more complicated.
at these times there are communauto flex available at almost every two street corner, it's perfect (it depends how far you go, or well if you come out hot from a bar obviously forget that)
yesterday i took a bixi instead of an uber from the plateau to hoshlag. it feels good to help the planet 👍
when i went out the night before the pandemic, i did my best to take the night buses (like you said, service is infrequent). it has happened to me more than once that the bus never came, and after 30 minutes of waiting i had to take an uber ....
with nightlife heavily impacted by the pandemic, i'm not sure if the demand from employees working at night would justify more buses at night.
take a bixi / community
uber is good, inexpensive, and safe.
there are now beautiful 100% electric cars on the market. i don't see a better alternative.
that pretty sums up my thought.
also i don't understand why we're again threatened to have cuts in our métro and bus services... the stm says it needs a bailout and i can already imagine some people already upset with their request.
but the truth is that the service needs to be improved not downgraded if they want people to quit using their car. it makes no sense to wait over 8 min for the next train or 30 min for a bus...
we will have to wait for communauto to offer autonomous flex cars for this kind of situation 😅
i love bixi but unfortunately i'm not brave enough to use it when the temperatures drop a lot or to cycle in the middle of winter.
>also i don't understand why we're again threatened to have cuts in our métro and bus services
look how many people have stopped using public transit over the pandemic. i'm amazed they've lasted this long without having to make cuts, honestly.
people aren't going to need to go to the office 5 days a week anymore. parking at the sheraton costs only $13 if you're in by 9am and out by 6pm. do i want to pay $90.50 per month to ride stinky, poorly-ventilated public transit, or do i want to be comfortable in a car? if i'm going to the office 7 times or fewer a month, there's literally no price difference and i'll get to the office faster in my car.
there seems to be a misunderstanding that public transport should be profitable. 
if this were the case, it wouldn't be public. 
clearly each person who leaves the car at home helps all of us move around easier, so why do we expect to get this for free?
it's not necessarily for everyone, but i personally love to cycle in winter. you just have to dress properly (layers !!), equip yourself properly (you don't need a fat bike but not take off like a fixie) and finally a little tip of "wow fuck i'm badass to ride a bike in the snow "to feel superior to motorists (the ego boost serves as motivation to pedal more)
there is no winter ... it ends in november :( it starts in april, for example, so it's more than half of the year that we can use it .
2021 was the first year i started using it, and here is my rundown ...
for:
- only $ 90 if you buy the full season in advance, it's like $ 12 per month or so
- available quite a bit everywhere on the island, and even a little outside
- the radius gets bigger from where you can go vs. foot (obviously). i was amazed to see how ... we discovered lots of new restaurants in other boroughs this summer!
- the android application works very well; it is quite fast / intuitive and it shows interesting statistics (mileage, calories burned, etc.)
- i don't have to worry about storage logistics or the theft of my bicycle
- i am much fitter
versus:
- few bicycles chronically in some places
- bicycles really heavy and often in need of maintenance
- overabundance of electric bicycles in places ... and from what i understand, it will get worse next year. it's $ 0.10 / min more for an electric bixi (for those not strong in math, that's $ 3 for 30 min plus your $ 90)
- most seats are not high enough for tall (i would say 5'8 "or more) people to have comfortable legs
- i have to drag my helmet everywhere with me
- i cannot bring it with me on vacation or to sépaq on weekends
overall, i highly recommend. at $ 90 for the season, the minor inconveniences are minimal. but i'll buy myself one next year. sorry bixi!
do it
i sometimes fear that, facilitating access to property, it will be especially for people who are already quite well off but who cannot afford big houses in montreal because of the crazy prices versus allowing people who have average incomes to afford a property.
subsidizing demand just drives up prices. they see that not only did the program not work, but that things got worse, why continue down this path? it is hopeless.
about the only thing the city can do is raise taxes. raising property taxes puts downward pressure on prices. in the long run you pay the same mortgage + taxes, but the down payment required is lower to buy, and it is better to send the money to the city than to the banks. not popular with existing owners of course ...
the rest of the solution (of the problem, i would say) lies with the federal government.
they should subsidize new co-ops and put in place new rules such that the amount of rent would be calculated according to the income of the tenant (s) ...
by subsidy? how about you freeze property taxes instead? idk seems to me that there is a gap somewhere. are household revenues keeping up with housing costs? like property taxes ??
vote movement montreal instead of these clowns
i personally benefited from this program in 2019 for the purchase of a plex with my spouse (pregnant at the time). we are definitely in the middle class and will be able to stay in montreal for a long time thanks to this purchase which was made in part possible by this subsidy (about $ 6,500 saved in welcome taxes). i do agree, however, that not all measures that help people buy will solve the problem. the only way to rebalance supply and demand in the current market is to build more and better.
the other thing on the supply side is to increase construction, right? it's very municipal ... relax zoning, regulations and simplify the permit procedures to encourage construction and densification!
couldn't there be a moratorium to ban airbnb, or people from buying a 5th property or business etc? act on demand to reduce it.
you are speaking real sense here. housing is bid for, allowing everyone to have more money will see the price rise and people will get the same house for more money. therefore only sellers who have more than one property can cash out, at the expense of everyone else.
you are also totally correct to say that raising property taxes will lower prices. the overall price to individuals will be the same, but crucially the increased taxes will be captured by society, rather than privately.
i'm absolutely dismayed projet montreal are doing this, plante is demonstrating zero comprehension of the economic dynamic here.
montreal looks less attractive by the day.
afterwards, this measure aims to subsidize certain requests (families / first buyers). so yes, it may increase prices a bit, but not that much either, and above all, it can change the composition of the pool of buyers a bit.
after, indeed, if there are no other measures, it's complicated (but pm offers others so good).
they are already doing it with social housing. it's just a long time to set up ...
the program is just to allow families to be able to get a higher loan. i ask myself: if it increases demand without necessarily increasing supply, prices will go up anyway?
decreasing property taxes will decrease the monthly cost of carry on housing meaning people can borrow even more, raising property prices.
taxing the unimproved value of land will chase out speculators and make housing cheaper:
a big step would be temporary halt on welcome tax.
bilingualmontr é/ealvillebilingue
the construction already seems to be running at maximum, both in terms of labor and materials.
banning airbnb would be a good thing .. it's a hotel in disguise. i don't know if that would have enough influence on the prices. prohibiting people from buying multiple properties ... i'm not sure that's constitutional. a tax on unoccupied houses / apartments would be a good thing, it helped in vancouver (without settling anything, but it had a measurable effect)
not sure i understand your logic. raising taxes might slow down the market a bit, but they will not lower the prices (except if the raise is realllyyyy big). and higher taxes will just mean it will continue to be really difficult for new buyers to enter the market.
also, this scientific paper even suggest that a national property tax cut in sweden did not impact house prices. ([
this said, i'm absolutely not an expert in that field, so thats that.
not even, because the market (people, whatever) reacts to the subsidy announcement and prices go up even before a first buyer can benefit from the subsidy.
indeed.
demand side measures don't do shit.
as long as he doesn't shove rent control down our throats, it's not too bad
selling those dodge chargers they got and laying off the useless stm security would probably help with that.
transit systems all around the world suffered temporary shortfalls during covid, and governments are helping to plug those gaps, to varying degrees. the province needs to take action to address the gap until revenue returns to normal. that's simply what you do when there's a problem with an essential public service. 
(as for why it needs to be the province and not the city, it's a simple matter of revenue. if the city collected the bulk of income taxes then it would be a different story.)
for this particular issue i'd sure feel better with a plq, qs, or pq government than the one we have. it's been a hard sell in quebec to support montreal when almost every mna from the island is in the opposition. but i'll at least give them a chance to get this right before i judge them too harshly.
stop paying your executive so much. i’ve always felt the metro service to be inadequate in this city. buses are always late and the metro always had shutdowns on a weekly basis. not only that but they spend so much money on stm cops to avoid fare skipping, but i don’t think it compensates for the salary that these guards make.
[deleted]
[deleted]
i have lived all over the world and the stm is by far the worst public transit in a city i have lived in..seoul and vancouver had the best. the buses here show up when they feel like it and the metro stops working in peak rush hour regularly. it’s so bad that at age 32 i signed up for driving school, did that whole process and now drive everywhere even though i live the plateau. also, there was an incident with a drunk homeless man yelling on the metro and that was the last straw for me….the stm sucks at their job. took public transit my whole life but never again (in montreal anyway).
fml. it is time for our governments to realize the importance of public transit for the well-being of people and the economy.
every dollar invested in public transport yields better economic returns (roi) than a dollar invested in automobile infrastructure, in the long term.
drivers complain about the stm without realizing the billions spent on automobile infrastructure and all the subsidies for parking (not to mention that each user must buy and maintain their own vehicle!) the automobile as a means of transport by default is not not sustainable, it's a question of space!
with better public transportation, you can keep about the same tax rate and everyone who doesn't have a car saves thousands of dollars a year in costs and insurance. it is downright cheaper! economy 101.
cut your costs on "security": no wannabe cop cars, rent-a-cops, plus the recent development of wanting to arm these clowns
go see the source. don't trust journalists.
good, stop charging people 250$ if they forget to renew their opus card.
and the artm, or another way to drown the fish. skip to page 94 of the pdf.
can they move to a more on-demand model for lesser-used routes and off-peak hours?
perhaps they should have done cuts when they were locking the province trying to get us to social distance and closing down every other business.  i mean public transportation is a lot more concerning in terms of social distancing than say a book store.  instead they kept the system running at full scale at near empty capacity for months on end.
hell they probably could have used the buses as ubers and saved money during those months the system was so empty.
mouhahah !!! cr \ * sse, can not cut * more *! ......... there will stay 2 metro and 3 buses for the whole network !!!!! 😂😂😂
how real is the problem and how much of it is corporate accounting?
90 bucks for buses to be 10 minutes late and the orange line to fully stop afterwards. throw the whole thing out and redo your service, stm
maybe it's time to cut the stm useless cops/security already?
keep your car gassed up.
i'm not saying it's an easy job ... but drivers get paid crazy amounts for what they do. the dude's in the booth doing nothing also get paid way too much...
most drivers with a few years under their belt can pull off $100k annually with some ot.

it's more and more visible in the city center too ... 😒
it's good for a reason. if it becomes more visible as a problem, maybe he will have more pressure to have a solution. for commuters like me, it's easy to say that the homeless and homeless are a downtown problem ... but when it's at dix-30, our fairview complex, maybe we'll be more motivated to to assist.
pre-pandemic, when downtown was full of office workers, restaurant and bar clients, theatre-goers, hockey fans, etc., a pan-handler could get a decent take each day. when downtown emptied their source of alms disappeared. then merchants went almost exclusively to no-contact "tap and pay", and people stopped carrying cash. so even if i wanted to throw an itinerant a $2 coin, i don't have one in my pocket. i used to walk around with a small stack of cash and a handful of coin, now i just have my cards.
yah guess what no one is denying there is a problem, its just that no one is talking about why there is the problem. and its a ll about population increase.
you cant ~~double~~ have a 50% increase in the population of a city every 10 years and expect something different. there is no physical or material way any city can keep up with a population explosion like we are experiencing in the north america. we are actually just mimicking the trajectory of latin america in the middle of last century. in 50 years if population increases in the same way (immigration and rural to urban centers) we will have shantytowns.
we don't care about the peasants of the city center / s
nah. they will do as before and just move them elsewhere.
it's still sad as a conclusion ... we live so much in a nimby world
montreal growth rate is less than 1% yearly for the last decade.  it isn't and hasn't been a boom town for decades.
2011 population: 3.94 m.  2021 population 4.24.
so, we aren't doubling in population, but did grow by 300,000 which would constitute a major city itself.
so growth has thankfully been slow, because that number alone represents a lot of housing to develop.
yeah. no. not even close to double. try again.
i totally agree. funny thing is that people see this point of view as “racist” . there is simply a huge mismatch between the capacity our construction industry has for building , and the population growth we are having.
at +70k per year for the metro area, we're the 6th fastest growing metropolitan area in north america, toronto is #1 at +130k.
that is the metropolitan area, not the city itself
2001	   1,039,534
2011	   1,649,519
2021    ?  waiting for census numbers, but its going track. maybe an increase in metro vs urban because of covid flight.
that is not a 1% growth rate.  between the 2011 and 2016 censuses, montreal’s population grew by 3.34% and that is for the metro area not the city proper. density wise we are @ the same # as toronto.
my bad increase by 50%, double in 20 years. point still stands. population explosions is the the cause of the housing crisis
yah the neolib establishment/ corporate hegemony/ crony capitalist/ gloabalists whatever flavour of ideology you care to call it,  really has convinced people its racist/backwards to have a normal or negative population growth rate. 
the most laughable is the "socialist" calling for open borders, its like dont you know that it is a way to destroy labour's bargaining power?
can you find that source?  i'd be curious how long that has been going on for
the population of the city increased from 1 to 1.6 million from 2001 to 2006 because of the municipal mergers, not because of population growth. the size of the city basically doubled.
even your source says that jump was because of the urban merger, lmao
very bad and deceptive data there.  the forced mergers took place and some of those municipalities stayed with the city.  this was not a population boom but just some politicans redrawing taxation maps.
that's a reason why i think real estate will keep going up in montreal. also it's the second fastest growing city.
that area is a dumpster fire.
stop stabbing people
what the fuck?
> and you don't fear for your life.
luckily, but the crunch of osti crottez that it did has still not been apprehended yet.
uh ... hello?!? can we get a description of the fucking madman stabber that's roaming our streets right now?
i can't believe there is zero video frame ...
wtf? in broad daylight?
"what are you gonna do? stab me?"
defund the police... lol
stabbing people is bad :/
indeed.
it’s not the same person, and one was arrested.
you know very well pkoi there is never a description of the suspects.
don't you listen to the news?
i'd laugh but ....
oh i know, but i'm talking about the 2nd. do not tell me that since this morning, more than 12 hours, they have not got hold of the video evidence of the attack which took place in a building, in ville marie, near berri. there are cameras everywhere ...
this is the spvm youre talking about, not exactly known to be a top notch professional police department lol
true 😂
nothing new
they will not recruit in chslds
do they give out flyers and cookies? or even better fortnite cash?
2001-2010 vibes.
do you have to be vaccinated to join the gang?
[deleted]
yeah that's always been the case.
they should if they want to contraband granny's' recipes
unfortunately it's an even lower investment than that, they just have to give out self-esteem and a sense of belonging.
? the breed was not mentioned once either in the article or in the clip.
i do not really understand your comment. copaganda? i mean, you may disagree with police methods i guess, but it's not people with peace and love signs that intervene when there are literally shootings ...
we definitely need more workers in schools tho
xd touch
depending on which area of the city and the timing i'm interested. i'm english, chatty, and a really great cook/baker/cleaner. message me privately for contact info.
go on the fb page called “montreal cleaning collective”. ([link](
there’s tons of english speaking cleaning ladies!!! like tons!!! check out market place on facebook.
props for taking care of your mom, not everyone does.
which part of town
cleaning services are deemed "essential" and should never have stopped. ours is a crew of 3 (husband,wife and sister) and they are in and out in 1 hour. alas, they are fully booked. we found them facebook
i’m looking for one as well. have a dog, and need a clean freak .
first, i'm sure there's plenty of francophones that are perfectly able to clean a home.  just prepare written instructions in french and let the person work.  my cleaning lady can't stand clients that follow them around the house telling them how to do something.
otherwise, there's a massive amount of people willing to do this work that happen to be english speaking.
house cleaning is difficult to find and keep. so adding language requirement is just making it more difficult ...
edit: looks like many don't like my comment but seriously, i lost one cleaning lady during covid, another found a better job. the one i currently have isn't great but i can't complain, there is no one to replace her. facebook is full of people asking for help.
even hotels are having a hard time finding staff.
ouf, tough one, but if you have the luxury of choice, go with a portuguese or philipino
on it.  she's not super internet savvy (obviously) so she's only called a few places.  i'm sure i'll find something that works.
top part of lachine, basically montreal west.
oh i agree, but my mother is the chatty type, so i'm sure she'd want to be able to speak with the person, that's the only reason i'm looking some something language specific.
ya, she isn't having much luck so i'm asking around.  only know a few people that have it, and most of them lost it during covid.
what the fuck
they make the best chicken
yes i get it. do the internet sleuthing and hook her up :) hopefully she’ll get a mutually chatty person!
ill save this thread. i'll see if my cleaning lady would be "interested" she already grumbles coming here (i'm not far away from your mum)
i know a lot of recently arrived women that live around there, some are doing housekeeping. shouldn't be too hard to find in that area.
it is clear that that limits the choice ... my parents had housekeepers but very few spoke english.
i bet it's a next montreal ensemble candidate. he has the background
chest-bras-chest-barreaux
tabarnak ... is he 49 years old? steroids put stress on the body lol
south shore cops are extremely shady. weren’t they recently got caught for being in relation with catalytic converter thieves
we should test the police for steroids like we test athletes. sometimes we see that it is obvious that they are not natural. one could argue that it is legal for everyone, but until it is, the police should lead by example. there are also the side effects to consider as aggressiveness, and the fact that since it is not legal the dosage is not supervised by a doctor.
what shocks me is that he does his own stock. i always believed that it took a lot of knowledge to do that. it's not as easy as growing a pot.
what i don't understand is that all of this can be done in "semi-legality". find a doctor, tell him you have testosterone problems. a little money under the table and pif paf poof you are prescribed a ben legal testosterone replacement therapy.
but personally, i wouldn't buy stock that a dude makes in his garage.
what's his phone number?
it is amazing.
a next people's policeman?
this is what i also said to myself. looks like he's in his sixties ...
you're right, but most kids at the gym don't have an education in smart steroid use (yes yes it can!), so they're going to rely on the biggest dude in the place thinking that taking dianabol will automatically give you a safe dream shape. dianabol is a fast bulking steroid that is simple to produce, so it is taken as a pullule and not as an injection. knowing all this, it's easy to see why there is a market for poorly manufactured steroids: the lack of education. personally i think that should be part of the basics (like personal finance and basic taxation) but apparently the minister of education does not agree 😅).
911
really interesting, thank you!
i love this series on montreal, thank you.
i actually own a business that's across that specific tim hortons. it's insane how many cars (mostly customers) get towed everyday by that tow company .
example: one of my employees last year, when to tim hortons by car to pick up 2 boxes of donuts for our office as we usually do every week (because my employees ask and enjoy that treat) and she walked across to drop them off at our office before she drives off to one of customers. in 6 mins (walk to the office, drop and go back to the car at tim's), her car was gone. i paid her ticket but told all my employees to never go back to that tim hortons.
i understand sometimes you have non-customers who park their vehicule and leave for couple of hours (those should get towed).
this is so horrible what they do to actual customers  (most of these people are poor- i can see their faces when their car get towed) -- i paid for twp customers tickets. it's morally wrong and fraud "not sure i'm using the right word" .
to avoid all of this mess.
they should put a big  warning sign that says something like: customers or non-customers are not allowed to leave their vehicles in the parking lot if they leave the tim hortons premises or they will get towed.
this tim hortons la ... and mc do forward, they're both guarded by a security guard. it's one of the worst places for parking too.
when you get out of your tank, he watches you. if you do not enter the restaurant, immediately he calls the towing. and i'm sure they're not the only ones in montreal. the cash must flow in this kind of situation
man, people love to victim blame for a quick righteous fix. this is such, such a slippery slope...the problem is not that people are getting towed for using the tim's parking lot without actually going into said tim, that's not the point. it's that there's a towing company illegally holding your car against a 117$ ransom. justifying this type of practice will simply open the door to more businesses having a towing company parked 24/7 in front of their store and immediately tow everyone that's not instantly running inside the store and instantly driving off, milliseconds after exiting their shop. the next step is that they'll start charging more than 117$, and eventually they'll start towing actual customers. ex: 
"towing lucky luke"
besides, if he tows your car to their business, you don't need to pay. you ask for your car immediately and tell them to send the bill home to you, and you have no obligation to pay it.
it was the same problem before at tim hortons in verdun. as long as you parked your tank and put your foot on the sidewalk, there was a plow on a sun chair with a cibi that called an old tabarnak with its towing. it was blocking the parking lot all the time like a thick one. i complained to tim hortons head office telling them it was extremely abusive to do this. since then, the plow has disappeared.
the tim hortons owner isn't to blame neither is the tow truck company. however the article is correct they cannot "hold" your car and they can't tow your car if someone is in it. so i'm a bit confused at what sensationalism jdm is trying to get across
theres a guy with a cellphone that stands there all day watching where the parked customers go. hes already talking with the truck driver.
since when has cdn been considered "the west island of montreal"?
the question i ask myself is rather why are they so wild in this corner with the towing and the only legit answer i see is that there is a train station nearby and it is probably due to the lack of incentive parking for the world of st leonard and rdp who will take the train to centerville and as they have more space in the parking lot offered, they will park all day in the customer spaces of the mini-malls in the surrounding area.
ah, towing. one of the few industries that actually *prefers* to hire convicted criminals.
don't let yourself go, defend yourself.
when they say to call the police, does that mean calling 911 (normally reserved for emergencies) or a police station number?
it's a concern if everyone calls 911, congesting the line for people who really need it.
i mean isnt that rule kind of a given?? 
while i don’t agree with the shady towing tactics here, if i park at a grocery store’s free parking lot and walk to get coffee at a café next door even for a couple minutes, why would that be fair to the business? (especially those that have busy lots)
most signs usually say that it’s parking for customers for the duration of their visit (and not for the time to visit adjacent shops/businesses.) offering parking isn’t free to business owners either.
aka "parking reserved for customers"
it remains private land… if a * rando * is parked in my driveway, i won't wait long before bringing in a towing (true story…).
the towing mafia is never going to spit on a cash-making opportunity.
i've had a towing company come and put up signs at work. i tossed all the signs in the trash then called them asking to come get them. the owner was very stereotypical.. covered in gold chains and rings. tried to strong arm me into using his services then said what i did was illegal by tossing his property out. i told him to call the cops if he had a problem but first he would need to get off my property. he muttered around for a few mins and finally left. 
it's not a bad thing to have if there are people abusing the parking situation in a limited area. they business is likely getting 30-50$ commission off the deal under the table. while it might be easy to jump to victim bashing the signs are clearly visible. besides the truck isn't driving far with the car if they can come back that quick. there is also a law on how far they can take the car.
on the phone the company will say "we towed it to a secure yard etc" in order to strong arm you into paying when in reality it's a couple blocks away. it's such a grimy industry
the fees are set by the city though and the industry is pretty well regulated here in montreal. in ontario it's the wild west and in that video you posted
it's basically carnapping
this is r/montreal. people see cars and automatically assume bad. it is partisan politics at its fucking stupidest.
wow, coderre surrounds himself with candidates of questionable morals... like he has always done!
"respecting the highest ethical standards, dimitra is a member of a disciplinary committee of a professional order, one of the main objectives of which is the protection and the best interests of the public."
she is also involved in the greek community. she chaired the board of directors of a community home for the elderly. "
if i have learned anything from trumps and other crossers in this world she must cram the old ones too.
will there remain one of them less clean by the time the vote coudonc?
[new face, same gang of crosseurs.] (
no way !! people crooked in municipal politics?!? to montreal?!? in the coderre team?!? impossible! 🤣
the next to recruit is vincent lacroix.
"but what is she doing in the team of a 'former' liberal?" is a question that no one asks.
so cdn has the choice between an antivaxxer, a old persons scammer and a woman that has been city councillor of cdn for 8 years. jeez such a tough choice
tabarnak there are just damn scammers in the coderre team.
fuck away denis, fuck away.
why am i not surprised?
shocking
[deleted]
and coderre sees no problem there. not surprisingly, he himself has elastic ethics.
team culture is self selecting.
this is clearly the result of negligence in vetting, the candidate being deceptive, or, most likely, both.
suggesting coderre deliberately picks crooks over honest folks is idiotic.
and yet, a nasty bunch of idiots are going to vote for them because they "can't smell plante."
this is just the start, stay tuned for what's coming out next week !!!
spoiler: not
i invite you to also check coderre's candidate in ahuntsic, i don't know if she is crooked but her incompetence is legendary.
vicente lacrosse not all the same guy!
australian/canadian here, i've been living in montreal for 14 years. i've been to ta pies many times. i think they're pretty good, but they're not the best australian pies in the world.
i find their pastry to filling ratio to be too heavy on the pastry. i also find their meat (beef) pies have too much tomato flavour. as is customary, i prefer to add ketchup (tomato sauce in aus) to the top of the pie, i wonder if they bump up the tomato flavour in the pie so you don't need to add ketchup, although they have ketchup available at the restaurant too.
that said, if you went to five different bakeries in australia and bought a standard meat pie at each one you would get five slightly different pies, and people would probably disagree as to which one was the best.
the sausage rolls and lamingtons at ta are pretty good, and if you're looking for a bit of australiana in montreal it's a bit of fun to drop in. of interest, the owner/baker is originally from new zealand.
7.5/10 for the pies, i recommend.
i don't doubt they are very good, but it's not hard to be the best when you are the only one...
kiwi here, i reckon hugh jackman is only rating them so highly because he's comparing them to pies in australia.
they're kind of the only "australian pies" in montreal so it's a bit pointless calling them the best.  what's the competition? they are very tasty but i agree that they are calorie bombs and could use a higher filling to pastry ratio. had meat pies in australia many times.
web review says nz restaurant, shop front says nz restaurant, owner is kiwi...
how does this count as australian pies? weird.
thanks for putting this place on my culinary radar. i had the classic pie yesterday afternoon and the butter chicken one for breakfast. both were outstanding.
i may be completely ignorant ... but what is an australian pie? (yes i can watch the video to find out). but since when is this typical and important in the culture of montreal? from my point of view as a francophone ... it's 0.
i agree, it's a good pie but the pastry is too much. it's good but if they gave more filling and less pastry, especially around the edges, the pie would be better
thanks for the review. still though 7.5/10 is pretty solid. how are the sausage rolls?
it may be the best, but it's also the worst 🤔
exactly, australians stealing all the glory again. genuinely though, nz does better pies in general
do the kiwis have nuclear submarines?
their signage (at least before the reno) and [web site]( say both. the owners are a husband-and-wife team: he's a new zealander and she's a quebec-born australian citizen. so it sounds like they have all the bases covered.
it is because the culture of montreal is one of diversity, not of quebec hegemony.
a good cooking culture is one that is exposed to various sources, it is good that the world can taste it and try it. if you don't like new things you can always stay at home and eat locals pitch soup.
the sausage rolls are pretty good. it's been a while since i had one though. i picked up a couple last weekend but i haven't eaten them yet, they're still in the freezer.
a surprising find a while ago was the sausage roll from cocobun inside the berri metro, next door to the the pizza place. they call themselves a hong kong style bakery, which is a term i'm not familiar with at all, but their sausage roll was very similar to what you would find at bakeries in australia. since covid and work from home i'm no longer taking the metro every day, so i haven't been there for a long time. i'm not sure if they still make them, i don't see them on their website, and i don't know if the berri location is still open, but if you're going by a cocobun (there are a few of them) i suggest you take a look.
i did not know that "australian food" existed before i came across this link. i will admit that it doesn't make me want more ...

i'm just saying it's not montreal (this youtube channel usually relates typical montreal things). ps: i have visited 26 countries and all over the world and i have tasted hundreds of exotic dishes ... and you? 
why are you asking this question then?
> but since when is this typical and important in montreal culture?
i visited: you have as much time as you want to do it, not 30 minutes. by offering tickets every half hour, the botanical garden simply wants to ensure that crowds are minimized.
my visit lasted about 90 minutes.
i went with my wife and kid last week, buy your ticket online to avoid being the girl at the ticket office.
no one checks once you're inside, it took us about 1 hour to finish.
thank you for your answers, that answers my questions!
go there a little later in the evening. if you go early, you won't have the full experience.
i love the ile de la visitation! a corner of the countryside in the city!
not too far from home! it is a very beautiful place! :)
beautiful photo!
i love that they put more emphasis on the first nations garden this year. it seems appropriate to me following the events of the past year.
i also liked that they did not overload the chinese garden as was the case in previous years. fewer lanterns that allow you to better appreciate the garden.
i'm going tomorrow with friends, been a while since last i visited. is it worth it?
[deleted]
yes! the chinese garden is particularly gorgeous.
yeah, it was fun, found parking easily, lotsa kids roaming around, free tea at the japanese garden, an evening well spent...
it’s better than it was 2 years ago. just a little disappointed not to be able to buy a moon cake.
read the title again.
what did i miss, a question about the location of the event?
