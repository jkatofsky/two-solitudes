My family and I left Washington State on Sunday. I'm Canadian and haven't been to Canada in 20 months. We entered Canada at the Abbotsford crossing. It's pouring rain.
We didn't realize how serious it was until we got to Hope and the Transcanada and Yellowhead were closed. The only way out was the crowsnest pass. As we drove we passed an accident in the opposite lane. The lineup went for tens of kilometers. We now realized we were in the only working highway lane. We got to Princeton as the sun was setting.
My wife wanted to stay as we have a 5 month old baby and 13 month old dog. But I wanted to be in a city with resources. So I made the call to drive the 2 hours, in the storming dark, to drive to Kelowna. I was terrified I was making the wrong decision.
As we went up Highway 5A we steered around two boulders that were in the middle of the road. As well as three stopped vehicles half in our lane, half on the non-existant shoulder. We eventually caught up with a long train of vehicles led by one slow vehicle (no blame there). The train of vehicles growing behind us.
We arrived at the junction of 97C and *everyone* continued to go to Merritt for the night as it was only a few km away vs. a lot more for Kelowna. My wife (who is American and unfamiliar with the towns and roads) mentioned how scary it is to go in the opposite direction everyone else is going. All I said is, "every time I've driven through Merritt the weather has been terrible. We can't go there. It won't be safe." 
We arrived in Kelowna and honestly it didn't really hit us until a day after at how close we came to being stranded. Every town we visited was devastated up until Kelowna. It felt like we were in an apocalypse movie and we were the only family that made it out.
We spent two nights in Kelowna to wait the storm out as we continue  onto Edmonton to meet family. I write this from Invermere. We'll wait here another night if we need to.
Update: Made it to Edmonton safe!
I'd really like to see an acknowledgement of how unprepared we are. In the interest of scrimping by, we've neglected our infrastructure and supply chains. Some accountability for this mistake and a commitment to improving would go a long way.
Lots of panic buying in kelowna, definitely other places too no doubt. Shelves of superstore were empty, and thats not an exageration. Stay safe fellas.
Ok since there's a megathread here I'll repost what I put in the original post
According to city officials, the Barrowtown pump station is expected to fail in the coming hours, leading to what is believed to result in "catastrophic flooding" that may very well reek full and total devastation of Sumas Prairie. 
There is only a small hope of the prevention of total destruction of Sumas Prairie. 
All residents are ask to evacuate immediately, do not attempt to seek shelter or get into a more suitable area to prevent flooding. Leave and call 911 if you are currently unable to or are in need of assistance. (NOTE : Abbotsford Police urge those in need to call the 9-1-1 emergency number instead of the non-emergency number for immediate assistance)
UPDATE : Abbotsford Mayor Henry Braun will address media at 9PM PST (12AM EST)
u/jello_sweaters provided the following links to help those in need that have been impacted by the flooding.

Jesus. We will be trapped in our city if the sumas prairie floods and becomes a lake. It’ll take months to fix. Well, we can at least go east once they get the highway fixed that way
Edit: and access via Agassiz when that’s cleared.
Edit #2: panic has subsided because the Barrowtown pump station seems to be holding up. They were calling for it to fail in “7 hours” around 9pm. Let’s go, little station!
[deleted]
A century ago, Sumas in the Fraser Valley was a vast inland lake.
It is currently becoming a lake again, because the Noosack river in Washington has been diverted north (diverted south by the last eruption of Mt Baker) and the Barrowtown Pumping Station (the second busiest pumping station in North America) is failing after its pipes have burst. Several hundred thousand acres are about to be submerged beneath raging floodwaters, with no way to drain them.
This isn't the exciting thing, though. Nor is that every road and rail link out of the lower mainland is destroyed with no date of re-opening. They might have the longest and most treacherous route, the 99, open by next week.
https://twitter.com/KamilKaramali/status/1460691884041400322
Bobbing there in the Coquihalla River, where its protective road has been ripped off, is 200m of the Trans Mountain Pipeline. The 60+ year old, 300,000bpd oil & fuel link between the pacific coast and Alberta. This pipe carries 90% of the refined fuels supplied to British Columbia. It provides 10-15% of the unrefined supply for the refineries in Washington State. This is not the only location where it has been compromised. The road to either side of this location has been totally destroyed in both directions in multiple places.
I really did not have Vancouver, British Columbia down as the first place in North America to collapse due to a climate-change induced disaster, but here we are. It's happening.
We are about to watch some serious shit go down over the next few weeks.
Within our lifetimes we will see a time when pretty much every year, everywhere in BC, will have both heat and floods that are worse than this. Time to plan for a managed retreat. And definitely, definitely stop the breakneck development and population growth.
My wife works in environmental public health and I work with the government as a public health worker as well. I would say I was on the the more negative side of what the impacts of global warming would be, but this and other events unfolding are demonstrating even I was completely off with how bad this would be. I now believe that 2.5 degrees and higher will collapse most human societies. Canada also is going to fair much worse than smaller more nimble societies. We have such stretched out, costly infrastructure
As global warming due to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions continue, natural systems that were once relatively stable, measurable and predictable will become increasingly unstable. Developed societies like British Columbia will have to spend more and more time, money, resources, and attention to mitigating the consequences of that instability. But the problem is, climate change-induced natural disasters will not be a one-time thing. Yes, people will clean up after a flood or a typhoon. But the floods and the typhoons are going to happen again. Because the drivers of the natural disasters - human greenhouse gas emissions - have not gone away. Actually, they are just getting stronger.
The result for developed civilizations like British Columbia is that more and more resources will be devoted to responding to instabilities and attempting to maintain stabilities that were once gotten for free. Eventually, every developed civilization will start to run out of resources to be able to do so. 
It's like having a poisonous snake biting a patient's hand, that is continuously injecting venom into the patient's body, and doctors are unable to remove it. They respond by continuously injecting antivenom into the patient. The problem is, even if the antivenom works for a while, eventually you are going to run out of it. And cycling between high venom-high antivenom levels in the bloodstream is eventually going to cause problems in other organs of the body. There will be a positive feedback loop, sometimes in ways that the doctors can't even predict now, that will eventually kill the patient.
Some carbonate rock formations in Siberia are now emitting methane as a result of summer heat waves over the past two years. Something I've never heard of before and I don't think any scientist ever foresaw happening. It was/is an unknown unknown. And more of them will emerge as the climate crisis gets worse.
There’s a fire now at Sumas Mtn Rd & North Parallel (in the direct flood zone) 
It’s an RV store
Edit: the fire is out now [Abby PD has some pretty crazy photos of the damage](https://www.facebook.com/216416955042766/posts/6668004163217314/?d=n)
As someone who got flooded last year, I hope everyone stays safe. I also wish them the best of luck when they return home.
From the south good luck to Canada. I hope you are all ok and safe. I knew nothing about this until DDE highlighted in their video. This is the stuff I wish the news showed!!!!!
Stores in Chilliwack were restocked yesterday as if nothing had happened.  Mail and other courier freight is getting through.
It's raining again, though, and is expected to rain throughout the week, so hopefully the work that has been done and is ongoing will prevent any repeats of last week.  There are still a lot of people out here, including several hundred CAF, working extremely hard to help us recover from all of this.  I'd hate to see any of that hard work undone.
Looks like another one of those once in 200 years weather events guys!
any updates as to the impact short term or long term on rail?
Canadians were extremely generous when Australia was on fire in (our) summer 2019/20 and I would like to return the sentiment.
I don’t trust donations made through Red Cross go where they are intended and if it does it is too slow to help those who need assistance NOW. Is there any other appeals being organised for the BC floods? (Preferably not through religious organisations).
Is it possible to drive from Hope up to Prince George now since they have had some time to make alternate routes ?
I work in restoration, 
100 / 200 year flood are coming more and more...   
Wild fires every summer
It's not going to stop anytime soon, it will get worse and worse until we get kicked off the planet...

Just watch 5 minutes of her TED talk and you will vomit at the insincerity
Why would she give up all that white privilege to claim to be indigenous?
Queen of the self tanning cream and teeth whitener. Nothing about her is real.
There are a lot of these stories coming out. People making claims of indigenous heritage to make a few $$’s. They are fact checking a lot of people now..
When I worked for the Feds we had a few Pretendians get job. One was a Russian.
I am a Métis female whose grandfather was ashamed of being native due a residential school beating it out of him and she’s up there playing dress up for sympathy makes me far more than annoyed. It’s a indigenous health expert and I think that she is unqualified to assist people in dealing with issues of systemic racism in the medical system. The indigenous community has a long distrust in the medical community and having this person lie to take that position probably doesn’t help in that regard.
Can’t you just identify as whatever you want at this point?
would you look at that, we got ourselves our own Rachel Dolezal here lol
The CBC investigation - which is linked in this article - was really good. They weren't  damning her through their writing, they just let the evidence do it for itself.
It was a great read.
>Bourassa didn’t offer any genealogical evidence that she is Métis, Anishnaabe or Tlingit. Instead, she said she became Métis in her 20s, when she was adopted into the community by a Métis friend of her grandfather  
>She says she has been adopted into five other communities as well. She didn’t offer any explanation as to why she claimed to have been born into a family with Métis, Anishnaabe and Tlingit roots.  
>she identifies as Métis and that the elders who support her do not rely on “blood quantums” to assess Indigenous identity.
My grandfather's friend caught a 40 inch muskie once, maybe I can be the fisheries minister. Fucking hell, the government is so full of useless grifters it's unbelievable, they must be having a laugh at everyone else.
Did anyone else notice that NY Post refers to the CBC as “state-owned media” lmao
I'm surprised she did not hit back because she is not allowed to "identify as" whatever the fuck she feels like it lol
Open a door for the liars the cheaters , scammers and cons and they will walk right in and a lot of them will rise to the top be because we reward success at any cost.
She's a product of her times.
You cannot build a preferential system that has lucrative openings like this one reserved for a specific ethnicity without running into the odd person that's willing to fake it in order to get access to the opportunity.
The solution isn't to turf otherwise qualified people because they lack the right ethnicity, it's to get rid of the discriminatory structure in the first place. You do not, in any way, need to be Indigenous to be an expert on Indigenous health, any more than you need to be male to be an expert on men's health, or female to be an expert on women's health, etc.
The fucked up thing about the fIndians is that they're actively overwriting what little native history exists at a time when legitimate scholars are doing their best to recover and preserve what we have left before it's lost forever.  
We simply can't afford to have these weird self-hating white women running around espousing their weird teenaged fantasies because it's all getting recorded in history.  
It is shocking to think that there's a large number of people these days who think that all of the tribes spoke the same language, had the same traditions and believed they all lived on a place called "turtle island."  
Their actions are incredibly damaging.  
Even worse, they espouse a kind of racial hatred that can only be achieved by someone who is so self-hating they decided to pretend to be a member of another race. Someone who absolutely loathes their own race and is desperate to attack it from the position of an outsider, no matter how false that may be.  
It's a disgusting situation. They inflame racial tensions, destroy history and worst of all, they're paid handsomely to do it.  
This woman is an utter disgrace.
Lmao how many times has this happened its like in 2018 when a few american academics turned out to be dolezals
It's funny that there is so much white privilege white people have to pretend to be minorities.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/canada) if you have any questions or concerns.*
*the clinic receptionist gave her two options: get fully vaccinated or provide a negative COVID result within 24 hours of getting tested. She needed to provide the test result just to make an appointment, the woman said.  She would need another test the day before the appointment.*
So these women had a choice to get vaccinated or show a negative covid test within 24 hrs for a in person appointment or be scheduled for a virtual meeting. What am I missing here..?
This story is clickbait to create sympathy for unvaccinated.
Doctor asked to show negative test before services and patient refused.
>Berardi is particularly concerned about those who may have experienced unnecessary delays in getting needed surgeries, medication prescriptions or procedures like routine checkups. 
Oh the irony.
> Berardi is particularly concerned about those who may have experienced unnecessary delays in getting needed surgeries, medication prescriptions or procedures like routine checkups.
The hypocrisy is unreal. For the past 2 years, regular surgeries have been delayed across the board due to covid-19 patients needing urgent care. Doctors and nurses are exhausted. Even now that we have the vaccine, pockets of anti-vaxxer holdouts are still stubbornly clogging up the medical system. Thousands of normal people are suffering needlessly from chronic health conditions that are not their fault, and why? Because a small but significant chunk of the population like this woman refuse to get vaccinated and do their part to stop Covid. They don’t care about anyone or anything, except being able to feel a smug sense of satisfaction by playing “victim”.
And then the instant their destructive, antisocial vendetta causes them the *slightest* inconvenience, they’re suddenly “very concerned” about reduced access to the health care system. As if they haven’t been collectively imposing that same thing on the general population for the past year.
>Berardi would file a professional misconduct complaint with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Nova Scotia,  saying she was denied treatment based on her vaccination status. 
>Both the college — which regulates doctors — and the Nova Scotia government say vaccinated and unvaccinated patients deserve the same access to care.  
This is really the only pertinent policy here. Like it or not, if the college and the government of Nova Scotia has decided that there must be no difference in how vaccinated or unvaccinated people are treated, the doctor is wrong.
Denying unvaccinated patients healthcare is unacceptable. I say this as a family medicine resident. However, we only have half the story here. Maybe she was asked to get a Covid test or to take the last appointment of the day and refused. Maybe the physician thought that an in-person appointment wasn’t necessary. We won’t know the true story because only one of the parties is allowed to speak out.
I'm in ontario.  Our family doctor no longer sees patients with any symptoms.  She sends us/them to a cough and flu specialist.  It's a new service specifically to deal with colds and flus, so that COVID stays away from the family practices.
> Berardi is particularly concerned about those who may have experienced unnecessary delays in getting needed surgeries, medication prescriptions or procedures like routine checkups.
Apparently not concerned enough to get vaccinated.
It's stated pretty clearly in the College's Professional Standards and Guidelines for Ending the Physician-Patient Relationship that a physician can immediately discharge a patient if said patient "poses a safety risk to office staff, other patients, or the physician."
[https://cpsns.ns.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Ending-the-Physician-Patient-Relationship.pdf](https://cpsns.ns.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Ending-the-Physician-Patient-Relationship.pdf)
She was asked to show a negative covid test and refused. If she cant bother showing she's safe to have around others than fuck her.
I don't understand how anyone can see this as a good thing but alright, enjoy your "win"
No sympathy for her. All she had to do was get a negative covid test. Or get vaccinated. 
> Berardi is particularly concerned about those who may have experienced unnecessary delays in getting needed surgeries
I have multiple family members who have. Surgeries delayed because capacity was reallocated to covid cases in hospitals — case numbers driven largely by the unvaccinated.
My doctor has a vaccination requirement for in person visits. I love the idea that people who visit the doctor who are immunocompromised or elderly can sit in the waiting room knowing that they're as safe as they can be. It's not about the doctor its about all the other patients that are at risk by sharing the same space.
He has a right to refuse unsafe work
If the person seeking treatment refused to pay for a covid test, or show a negative result, then the refusal is justified. But if the non vaccinated person is negative and seeking care that we all pay for, the doctors shouldn't have grounds to refuse.
We don't need a goddamn covid apartheid here, these are still Canadians not monsters. I don't know the reason for their refusal to get vaccinated, but I do know that everyone needs medical care.
Everybody has the right to receive healthcare regardless of who they are or what they believe in. It's a fundamental right.
Covid has absolutely warped peoples sense of morality. 
Murderers and rapists get more compassion than people who haven’t gotten vaccinated against Covid 19.
I, for one, am surprised they even go to the doctors
Edit: to make it clear, I'm surprised because everything a doctor does is based on evidence-based medicine. That includes vaccines. So I'm surprised there are people who mistrust vaccines but trust a doctor to look after their health.
I am 100% pro-vaccine. That said, the doctor is in the wrong here.
> The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Nova Scotia policies regarding access to medical care state physicians cannot deny the unvaccinated in-person care.
As a care provider, he's not allowed to pick and choose which policies to follow. If he doesn't like it, he's free to find another profession elsewhere.

They give those things out to pretty much anyone.
From the outset we know that travel bans don't work.  People travel too fast so this variant is likely here already.  We need to start doing a better a job in living with it; COVID Zero is not attainable.
im so fucking fed up of this shit
South Africa, population 60 million with 35% vaccination rate, recorded 219 deaths from covid last week. Canada recorded 137.
South Africa is world leader when it comes to HIV prevalence. 30% of pregnant women have HIV there. More than 8 million adults have HIV, which takes out your immune system. If Omicron was as dangerous as they say, the death numbers would be much higher. 
Only 6% of Africa is vaccinated according to the Washington Post.
Source: Google tracker.
Why are we worried? Every country is taking the same actions they did when delta came out. 
Look how that turned out.
Wasn’t this the height of racism when Trump closed the borders to certain countries due to Covid? Now those who were saying it was racist are closing down borders to certain countries. Pick a lane already!
I have tickets to fly out to Bahamas this Christmas. Today is the last day to cancel to get a refund. What’s everyone’s guess on to if the travel restrictions will widen to be all countries (for example returning canadians from ANYWHERE will need to quarantine) ? For fully vax& returning with a neg PCR test. I don’t mind testing at all but can’t afford a 14 day quarantine
Many universities are going back to in person in January. It's gonna be interesting to see how this develops.
As with the delta variant. I'm sure Canada will actually do something after its here and full engrained in society.
Remember when we ask Trudeau to close border to China and he said it was racist. I would love to see how its not racist now to limit entry from africa.
I'm not cancelling my Christmas trip to England... I've not had a family Christmas's since I moved here 8 years ago. Had to cancel last 2 trips home so I don't care how long I have to isolate or if I get stuck over there with a travel ban. If they hadn't promised it was only 1 Christmas last year knowing this would become endemic, maybe if feel differently 🤷‍♂️
No thanks Jeff

If we just do a quick hard proper lockdown like Australia or New Zealand, this would all be over by now.
Travel bans buy us time. They are not an end-all, be-all, but they take what might unfold over days/weeks and spread it to many weeks. This gives local governments time to put other measures in place or otherwise react.
Of course, local governments seem mostly inept and so buying the additional weeks is probably not useful, but that's a different story.
> We need to start doing a better a job in living with it
What does that mean? 
What is it we are not doing today that we should do so we can say, screw it, bring every Greek letter for all I care because I did "this"... what is it?
This assumes their data is accurate.
>Only 6% of Africa is vaccinated according to the Washington Post.
Africa is a continent.

Trump's travel ban specifically from Muslim majority countries happened in 2017, a full two years before covid-19 became a thing.
You’re fine. I work in that business, they will not be adding any further restrictions beyond PCR. Canada has worked so hard over the last year to get this border open. Blanket restrictions will cause already fractured airlines to crumble.
Inflation he does not give  a fuck about, he still cares more about he new Bill C-10, and creating the ministry of truth.
Excuse me but Trudeau doesn't think about monetary policy
Someone in the press should ask him if he knows what inflation is.
Our current PM, hasn't changes his stripes in the 6 years he's been there. He has no plan. He and his team wings it. If you're good with that, you like him. 
Hopefully more and more people will come to realize a country the size and complex as Canada cannot be run by the seat of ones' pants.
We had a democratic election. He won…again. It’s not as if he was an unknown person with no track record. Canadians have known him since he was a child.
I have never voted for him.
Eastern Canada is happy. We live in a democracy and I accept their decision. I also look forward to a vote on Alberta independence if the day ever arises.
I hate this man!!
Lemme guess, it's Trudeau's fault? Lol
I doubt he has ever been to a grocery store, paid a hydro bill, or filled up a car with gas in his life. 
Inflation doesn't affect the ultra rich, it just presents opportunity for them to make even more money.
He has been asked. His answer is the same as it is for everything; “this government ensured the support of Canadians throughout this pandemic and will continue to support them in order to get the economy to rebound”.
He is too rich to care.
Nope, but he’s tossed gas on the fire, and does not give a shit it’s now an inferno.
Trudeau’s government has overseen the greatest increase in cost of living, housing, inflation and wealth inequality in Canada’s history over 6 years, not just Covid.
This was out of control pre-pandemic as well. These aren’t new issue, they have just been made worse by the pandemic.
So Yes, some of it is Trudeau’s fault, Canadian’s should not be giving him a “Covid Pass”. The Liberals should have been tackling these issues for years before Covid.
And it will be his fault when the Liberals do nothing to slow inflation.
sounds like he doesn't know just reading off the script
But the budget will balance itself remember.
Inflation is affecting every country, even big GDP ones like the USA.
The real reason?   IMF and their currency manipulation.  Doesn't matter what political party is in control.
It's the same story everywhere. The whole world is in the second gilded age.
Trudeau talks a big talk, now watch his walk - he appointed Steven Guilbeault, as his new minister of environment and climate change - an anti-nuclear-power activist.
Why?  Who benefits from the government's current approach to climate change?
I agree with this, Nuclear is relatively clean energy, and I live in Saskatchewan where we mine boatloads of Uranium, and have zero nuclear power.
On average, Ontario brought a new reactor online less than every 3 years, from 1970 through the early 1990s.  If we had maintained that rate we would have more than our current total electric generation capacity in nuclear.  We'd have to dump it at a loss and it'd probably cost a lot of tax money to subsidize.
That would not be a bad thing in this case.  Nuclear is not cheap but it is also not intolerably expensive, and we know how much it costs.  It's a reliable and mature technology at this point.
If we were willing to think more outside of the box, there are many amazing things nuclear energy could probably do.  Nuclear reactions can get as hot as you want, in terms of process heat.  That could be used directly with high efficiency to drive industrial processes.  We could synthesize carbon-neutral liquid fuels that burn for jet airplanes.  The British government is investing that for their military needs.  We could pipe the exhaust heat of reactors directly into our homes (relax -- after a few heat interchangers).  The Swedish already do that on a small scale.
This has all been possible since the 1970s, but fossil fuels have always been always a bit cheaper, and required no $10 billion capital outlays.  Once we shifted economically towards lower taxes and private capital investment, nothing on that scale was going to get built.  Hence the recent interest in probably less efficient but cheaper-up-front small modular reactors.
Just watch the radical environmentalists shoot this down all while we burn more fossil fuels waiting for the perfect solution
Edit spp
This. We also have the world's largest uranium and thorium reserves. Unfortunately they are in western Canada, because if they were in Ontario we probably would be in on this right now.
It's well past time actually, but when has Canada ever done the sensible thing in a timely fashion?
Any reasonable person with even the slightest background in science has clearly known this to be the case for a long time. The only danger of fission reactors is not properly storing the by products. Otherwise it's practically clean, low cost energy. Maybe that's why it's being lobbied against
You can power a small town with 1 reactor from a Nuclear Sub or Carrier so why not put the tech to good use.
Canada already has one of the cleanest electricity grids in the world: nearly 85% non-GHG emitting and getting better each year. 
But the bulk of Canada's emissions are not electricity, but transport, oil and gas production, agriculture/land-use, and building (AC/heating). Nuclear, wont necessarily address these.
Nuclear is our best bet. Especially with how clean it is relatively to how much potential energy it can produce.
Also these 'solar/wind are easy' people should really look into the reasons for the energy crisis in places like Europe or California.
Not saying we needn't invest in those as well but they aren't ready to deploy as baseload power in the Northern Hemisphere at least, nuclear would've been the thing to use in between if politicians had been forward thinking.
IMO we should have 1 nuclear plant for ever 2 million people. Minimum.
All cities/towns that rely on Gas/Diesel should be converting to SMR tech.
The time to get behind this was 20-30 years ago but the fossil fuel industry is quite strong and has been creating a lot of nuclear fud.
Now we've had a decade of underinvestment in nuclear and a supply shortage as well especially with Sprott buying up pounds from the spot market now worsening that. 
Fortunately it's abundant and minable but we need to invest in this rather than wasting money into renewables which aren't ready yet.
People don't really know how long it takes to commission and build any kind of power plant. The time for reevaluating this was a LONG TIME AGO.
I live in Ontario and I have been seeing SO many ads for nuclear energy. They all seem to be aimed at children. Most of them feature this animated nuclear power plant character talking about how great they are. Certainly they are preparing the next generation to be okay with nuclear (as they should be). I'm guessing Ontario plans to invest in nuclear once again, the Pickering plant is shutting down soon so I hope it's replaced with more nuclear
Thorium.
Thorium-based reactors are safer because the reaction can easily be stopped and because the operation does not have to take place under extreme pressures. Compared to uranium reactors, thorium reactors produce far less waste and the waste that is generated is much less radioactive and much shorter-lived.
Thorium also can't be used to make nuclear weapons.
Wow you don't say
Canada … has …. No money left …. For anything.

We’ve known this for at least a year.
Droplet protection is irrelevant against an airborne virus.
And Covid is airborne.
(May have helped a bit against the flu, however)
It was politically inconvenient to admit, however, that covid is airborne, since an airborne virus requires much more collective action and responsibility (air purifiers, ventilation, etc), while the spread of a droplet based virus could be blamed on individuals (hand-washing, etc). It’s political, and a political decision was made early on about which direction to go.
Most of the precautions we take are for show only but it does keep businesses open and give people sense of comfort when they're out and about
So we got fully plexinated for nothing?
Or are these people just anti-plex?
The Ontario science table sounds like a bunch of conspiracy theorists...:)
>All three agree. “There are plexiglass barriers that are absolutely OK,”  
 Jüni said, “if you have a checkout counter at a coffee shop. Where it’s  
 a problem (is) where you see (it) in schools or restaurants: there the   
plexiglass can impede ventilation and give people a wrong sense of   
security.”
From a common sense perspective, at Shoppers the dividers take up all the space at the cash to place the crap you buy lol! Haste equals waste.
Also, they have known sanitizing surfaces has minimal impact on the spread of Covid _for a year_. This is medical theater to reassure the phobic.
Everyone seems to have to shout (which produces more aerosols from what I understand) to be heard through them.
This article actually has "COVID-10" written. National Post can't even proof-read before publishing? Seems like something that any decent news outlet would catch...
I'd rather have the extra layer of security and not need it vs not have it and need it
I’m so sick of the anti-plexers putting my life at risk every time I go out. It’s literally just a piece of plexiglass. Deal with it.
Science is meant to be tested - not blindly believed at the first findings
>\> All three agree. “There are plexiglass barriers that are absolutely OK,”Jüni said, “if you have a checkout counter at a coffee shop. Where it’sa problem (is) where you see (it) in schools or restaurants: there theplexiglass can impede ventilation and give people a wrong sense ofsecurity.”
The article isn’t talking about dividers between people sitting at the same table...it’s about dividers separating different tables.  So it’s mostly a non-issue.
You'd think so, but the standard keeps lowering.
Sports at 13.
Boy, I really hope someone got fired for that blunder.
I agree. 
That’s why I always wear a helmet in my car. Race car drivers do it. It’s literally just a piece of hard plastic, not a big deal.
But that's the thing. It's not an extra layer of security, its an illusory waste of everyone's time and effort. 
According to this story, you don't need it full stop. You should encase yourself in hard plastic if it makes you individually feel better...
ok, but let’s be honest about it, that it’s protecting us against flu but not covid
Not unless we adopt their electoral system.
With our system, there's too much gain for the first place party to give up.
They have 7 parties in parliament. Mixed member proportional electoral system with 5% threshold. We have FPTP which always favors a two-party system (what the US has).
What fucking "success"? Merkel is still Chancellor, their new government hasn't even taken power yet.
Perhaps we should let this new government run for 9 to 12 months before calling it a success. Agreeing to come together is great, but successful usually means accomplishments. Right?
I mean, it's a *completely different electoral system.*
So, No, it doesn't offer lessons. What a stupid op ed.
>The Trudeau government has always been uninterested in Parliament, perhaps even a little afraid of it. This was true even when they had a majority, and became more visible in their first minority.
The only part of the article that makes sense.  No electoral system is going to fix having the wrong person in power.
The 'success' of having a neo-Nazi party garner a large share of the votes. We don't want that kind of success in Canada.
Super strange that the author had such praises for Germany here without spelling out the facts. I'm living in Germany right now and the whole reason for the weird coalition government is because the AfD, the super right Nazi-filled party, has become so popular and has managed to take so many of the seats. This forced the centre left and centre right parties to play ball just to keep the Neonazi party at bay.
For those who doubt the Neonazi tendencies of the AfD... During the first election with AfD, they posted signs in Berlin that stated "We make it ourselves" with a pregnant white blonde woman. This was their response to immigration. (I even have a photo if you don't believe me)
For those who praise the German electoral system, please realize that this system has also given an extreme amount of power to the worst people in this country. As a fully fledged party, the AfD will continue to get GOVERNMENT resources to fuel their horrible ideology.
I am very connected to this stuff and there are Neonazis in government, in positions of power, and have turned a blind eye to locally born terrorists and murderers. 
There as positive features of the German system, but this country is still learning how to be a democracy. It's sad to see this, but that's how Germany is given that democracy is comparatively new here vs places like Canada.
Let's hope Ontario can do a coalition to crush ford next year. Anything to get him out
Thank you for pointing this out. Building a team is great but it needs to demonstrate results. I hope for them to be successful.
No, but if may put constraints on what they can do
So they’re in a position of power *because* they received a significant share of the votes - and you think a better system would be one that figures out a way to shut out those votes because you disagree with them?
It’s one thing to have concerns but another to think your concerns justify the literal opposite of democracy.
This is completely false. AFD got 10% of the national vote, they couldn't even form a coalition with the CDU if they wanted to. They've had the same number of seats for the past few elections. The reason coalitions in Germany are difficult to maintain, is because the 3rd and 4th biggest parties (Liberals and Green) have too many key differences when it comes to environmental policy. Social Democrats and the Christian democrats aren't that far off on the political spectrum for the most part, which is why they've had so many previous coalitions, but without Merkel it seems the two parties won't be cooperating anytime soon.
I think that will be improbable, given the Ontario Liberal's recent announcement on overtly sexist riding nomination policies. Men tend to lean to the PC party, anyway, and I think that's about to become a deluge (and it should).
It depends on how you believe votes should be represented. If a party needs broad appeal everywhere, you prevent niche parties from accumulating power. This has obvious side effects, but nonetheless, you suppress fringe political entities. It's not perfect of course, but there is value.
No one would ever form a coalition with AfD (outside of the NDP in Thuringia, but that's another story) and you don't really get what happened. It's not about an AfD coalition. Rather, a minority government isn't allowed to rule in Germany, thus a coalition is required. If that cannot be reached, it triggers another election, which would have only helped AfD. No one wanted this, so the parties figured something out. It took more than half a year for a reason.
Shouldn't that cop, be like, I dunno, fired or something?
Or nah?
And in Canada, we give police offers a slap on the wrist when they should be fired

>Content, according to the decision, fired back: “but at least the police are shot back.”
As much as I don't agree with senseless violence occurring, no matter who perpetrates it, I can't say I'm as upset at this reply as I thought I would be.... lmao 
Also, I think the fact this took over 4 years for the police ethics committee, and over 3 years for the human rights tribunal either says we have a backed up system or a broken one.
The fact hes not immediately fired after the Human Rights Tribunal found him guilty of violating that mans human rights is why some people believe ACAB
Nah, cops are above the law. They get to make their own rules.
agreed.
Don't you know Canadian ceps are better than Canadian cops
Paid vacation is the best I can do.
I've looked at other source and they said:
>	The Laval police service told CTV News that it would apply sanctions and that "integrity, respect and diversity are at the heart of our service's values and guide our daily actions and our ongoing commitment to the Laval community."
Since the ruling just happened it's probably too early to believe that the police will get no consequences.
>Why do we trust the police with firearms over the average citizen?
Because we are morons.
the cop just said you are lucky you arent shot 
so the guy said you too 
thats fair play
"Since the ruling just happened it's probably too early to believe that the police will get no consequences." As a place holder I'm going to use the many past examples of cops gettign away with it.
"Because we are morons." We have evidence that the police are morons but the thing is they're morons who get away with it us normal morons we don't get away with it. So I ask yet again why do we trust the police with firearms over the average citizen?
I know, I know.
But let's not prematurely conclude that he didn't faced any consequences no matter how unlikely it is. That's all.
I meant that we are morons for holding that position.
"But let's not prematurely conclude that he didn't faced any consequences no matter how unlikely it is. That's all." Why? If something keeps happening over and over again at what point can we start assuming when something will happen yet again.
JT is forming a 'comitee' to 'manage' BC's recovery. My guess is that it will be full of massive mismanagement and imbezelment.
Also expecting, at-least 3 sexual assault accusations and someone gets called a racist.
And we should probably give a $900 million sole source contract to an organization that gives JTs family lots of money. That should help.
This should be common sense lmao.

Cause you know, there's a shortage of pine trees in Canada./s
People panicked about omnicron variant are turning them into toilet paper
Only a slight conflict of interest here.
Every year we hear the same thing 🙄
I think I'll avoid this shortage,  and go to the forrest, and just cut one down 🧠🤯😎
Actually illegal unless you own the land or are using it for campfire at that particular site if on crown land. Also illegal to move between zones
$5 for a tree permit in Alberta. You can cut 3 down under that permit, I believe. They sell permits wherever they sell hunting and fishing licenses.
Oh, I guess its different in Alberta, that's how it works here in Ontario

Makes sense. The stupid anti-vaxxers always seem to forget what a tiny minority are and how much real people are disgusted with them.
That's in step with last year when they [shared their freezers](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2020/12/15/this-ontario-health-unit-is-working-with-a-local-ice-cream-maker-to-store-the-covid-19-vaccine.html) with the Grey-Bruce health unit as vaccines started coming in. These guys demonstrate how a company should interact with a community.
Here's a little more incentive to love them .... Go get your 4$ off annual coupon. 
https://www.chapmans.ca/coupon/chapmans-4-annual-coupon-2021/
*Streisand Effect* offshoot.
As it should. Chapman’s has a history of treating their employees well and their ice cream is fantastic.
Any other products that the disease-riddled antivaxxers are avoiding? Useful info to know.
Not to sure where I'll keep four buckets of ice cream, but I'm glad I did my part.
I already switched to exclusively buying Chapman's a year or so ago, when I heard they were raising wages and such for their employees as a result of covid. There were a few positive news stories about them, can't recall the specifics, and I remembered they're a Canadian company too. I'll see what I can do about upping my icecream intake though.
I've never in my life bought Chapmn's ice cream but it's on my grocery list for this weekend.
Chapman's has donated a lot of money to their local hospice and schools. They have a hard time keeping employees because it's  barely above minimum wage in the middle of nowhere doing basic factory work.
There's always high turnover in that type of job but they don't have a lot of applicants that live nearby.
They could easily move production to Toronto but haven't.
I wish they'd sell higher end products without all the additives however
What we should really be upset about in the ice cream industry is how 90% of “ice cream” on the shelf is frozen dessert which isn’t even made from cream
The boycott was particularly stupid... the raise that the vaccinated workers got was equal to the cost of testing the unvaccinated worker.
>Chapman’s, a Markdale, Ont.-based ice cream manufacturer, became the target of a slew of anti-vaccination groups late last week after it instituted a new workplace rule that rewarded vaccinated employees with a $1-an-hour pay raise.
Well damn, now I guess I **have** to go out and buy a couple of my favourite flavours tomorrow. :D
They could just write “Alt right boycott backfires and causes [company name here] sales to skyrocket” and just repost the same article for every alt right boycott!
Fucking paywalls. Yes, there are ways around them, but it would be really nice to be able to click the link to the story, and then, now hear me out, just read the fucking story.
Took the kids to the store last night, told them they each get to pick one thing out of the freezer and keep it all for themselves as long as it said Chapman's on the box.  Fuck the anti-vaxxers.
I spent 220$ on icecream cause of this and im lactose intolerant.. all my neighbors getting chapmans this year lol yup I support.. def not on the other side of the fense here. Sorry boycotters.. I think you are outnumbered here. We will hold the companies up that you boycott and you will just be wasting your time and effort where it need not be spent.
See that antivaxers, you're a small minority and you will always be a small minority
the anti-covid, pro-science crowd need to start speaking up. Tell your employers you don't want anti-science idiots risking your health, tell your favourite stores and restaurants their careful safe measures make you feel safe and want to support them even more. If they only hear idiots they will have an impact.
Who doesn't love chapman's???  They use zero coconut or palm oil. All cream or milk in their ice cream
It’a important to remember that in most provinces, SCOP is voluntary for retailers.
Oh god. Having worked retailer, EVERY time an article like this hits the news you get a slew of jackasses demanding free stuff, whether its related to the article or not.
Yep!  SCOP ftw.
Gotten it a few times st Canadian Tire.  Some cashiers automatically gave it to me without mo asking, and some had to be prompted - as if they were hoping that I wouldn't know about it.
One manager at shoppers drug mart was sneaky AF, as I vaguely remembered that the item had a sale tag and the price, and I was charged full price.  He asked me to wait at the cash while he went to check and he said "nope, it's not on sale".  After I paid, I went back to the item location and surely enough, he removed the sale tag.  Ugh.
This is nothing new. But glad people are being reminded of it.
That's why I always take a photo of the tags when I buy things on sale at Shoppers. That's happened to me more than once before.  Also, if it rings up wrong, I offer to go back and look *with* the employee so they can't do this.
Some stores try to point to the end date of the sale that's printed on the shelf sale tag. However it's always in miniscule point size type so easy to miss. In Quebec I believe this excuse is not valid and a refund/discount must be issued as the onus is on the store to remove out of date sales tags.
Damn what a bitch lol
Ya lesson learned.  I would definitely go back with them every time now, but not like it happens that often.
Taking a pic of each item is good practice, but definitely takes a bit of effort.  Lol
I don't believe that's a valid excuse under the SCOP program  either.  If you actually read the sticker signs for the SCOP it actually says "If the scanned price of a non-ticketed item is higher than the shelf price, or any other displayed price," which would cover an expired sign as it would be a displayed price.
yup, so are our consumer protection as well.
Chief Louie is such a kickass man, he turned his band from an impoverished reservation into a thriving concern including tourism and construction businesses.
He doesn't mince words, and has taken flack for it, but you can't argue with success. He once mentioned seeing a young native man working at a Tim's (IIRC) and told the kid that he was a real warrior for working hard to better himself.
Dude rocks, and should be an example to anyone, Native or not, that if you want to improve it has to come from within.
If you tell people often enough that they are victims and that their life is somebody else's fault, then they start to believe it and give up.  I really like this guy telling people to be proud
Chief Clarence Louie is an amazing businessman that turned Osoyoos BC into a thriving, prosperous Band. 
 From Wikipedia:
He started the Osoyoos Indian Band Development Corporation (OIBDC) in 1988.[2] Through the corporation's efforts, the previously impoverished band started or acquired nine businesses, including tourism, construction, and recreation companies. The band now employs 700 people including non-First Nations. A high-profile business started by the OIBDC during Louie's tenure is Nk'Mip Cellars, the first aboriginal-owned winery in North America.
It's encouraging to read an article talking about difficulties First Nations are facing in their communities and not have it devolve into a condemnation of federal/provincial government for not having fixed it yet.
Great read. One thing I found interesting was his use of scolding. Scolding/shaming is a really common tactic today, but more often than not it is counterproductive. His scolding/shaming worked on the other hand because he had respect for the people he scolded and they respected him. While most shaming nowadays is between people/groups that can't stand each other to begin with.
Also, I thought this article was an interesting demonstration in moral foundation theory. Usually most articles about indigenous issues are coded in WEIRD/progressive moral language. This wasn't and spoke to me more as a result. As a right winger, this is the kinda language you use to to get a lot of us to open up our wallets.
How do the windows break?
Pride of ownership?  I thought the homes were owned by the band council.
Good article.
Rez kicking kinda sucks for the communities where those people end up, but at least someone is saying what everyone is thinking
I sure hope that his words are taken seriously in the 300 reservations he visited.
I won't hold my breath though.
Not just natives could learn from that. My local city council is pretty lax with repairs and graffiti in many areas. It definitely detects from the "value" of a neighborhood
They should be responsible for fixing their own windows as I would be if mine got broken
Thanks for posting this. His book is now on my Amazon wishlist
I had a native girlfriend and her house was the same, they just don't give a shit, holes in the walls, broken windows, broken doors. They did it all themselves because they fight with each other about stupid stuff and start breaking things. They are lucky they were even allowed to live there, they owed the landlord so much money and trashed the place. This was in a city, not a reserve.
This is a way of thinking that should be applied to everyone. We are all caretakers in some way.
This is an inspiring story.
That guy kicks ass! Wish there would be more people like him in Canada.

This is the kind of leadership this country needs. I would love a complete political overhaul where the new system is heavily based on FN principles of fulfilling your duty and coming to a consensus despite different interests. Partisanship would be strongly, strong discouraged.
Who breaks the windows
Start with the drugs not the windows plz

Who cares. ICU usage has been stuck in the same 130s range for the past month, despite irrelevant cases rising. Down from 160s throughout mid-September. Ontario Public Health said they won't even consider cancelling surgeries unless it passes the 250 threshold now, as they have increased operational capacity over the past few months. 
But if course, the irresponsible hysterical media needs to do their FEAR MONGERING and DOOM SCROLLING headlines about irrelevant case counts.
Yawn…
Boring!!! Find some real news, this narrative is played out and old!!
omicron hitting right at the seasonal increase, restriction fatigue, waning immunity of the double vaxxed, low booster uptake. Its going to be a bleak winter.
Hospitilizations lags cases though right?
Calm down it's literally just a number. People aren't freaking out the way you think they are.
Except for the hysterical clickbait irresponsible media.
How is this irresponsible?

At some point the unvaccinated need to be triaged to the end of the line.
Has the government thought of providing more room for healthcare, clearly this is a bigger issue than just covid alone, before covid people were waiting for surgeries. This truly shows how are tax dollars are being wasted
In the amount of time that any province had to prepare for today's headlines is equal to the amount of time it would have taken to build a whole new hospital or at the very least set up temporary accomodations for the so called un-vax. The army setup and then dismantled a field style hospital in my hometown cuz they couldn't find a use for it. Media said they were at capacity but yet never needed to use it?? Mask up, wash up, grow up
Wonder when our shit head hospitals admins are going to do their jobs and take blame for their share of the fuck ups? This is shit thats been going on for over a decade, so I call bullshit that its ALL covids fault. 
All covid is doing is proving to us how much we took for granted
Why are there 4 covid outbreaks at this hospital though? 
Yes I know they have covid patients who are contagious. But hospitals are supposed to be able to limit contagious spread.
Something I never see mentioned in relation to the pathetic state of our healthcare system is the fact it's apparently *so bad* we actually cannot go to war anymore. That's literally not an exageration unless we want hundreds or thousands of our troops to die from lack of treatment, which would be unbelievably pathetic.
[Here are our casualties from **one day** on D-Day](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/d-day-casualties-by-country)
>Canada lost just fewer than 1,000 men. About 340 were killed, 574 wounded, and 47 were taken prisoner.
**Just over one week's worth of fighting would overwhelm our entire national healthcare system, that is fucking pathetic**.
Of course what's absolutely never mentioned is that the Liberal government (i only mention party to show this isn't a left-right issue) at the time had some foresight. Between 1939-1941 (we had to wait until 1941 to see real action) Canada trained *~30,000 nurses* and hundreds of proffesional doctors. We additonally built dozens of semi-permanent and permanent hospital. As a result no Canadian troops died due to lack of treatment on our soil.
[removed]
Why arent we using the field hospitals we built and equipped at the start of this. Seems ridiculous. Its been 2 years. Our ICU's were already full before covid as well. Been 2 years and no progress whatsoever.
Fuck y'all antivax and antimask.
An unpopular opinion, but shouldn't we more focusing on enhancing our healthcare system? Train more healthcare people, adjust our eating habits. In Soviet era, without going into the issue if it was bad or good, most student girls were required to take medical training, so why not include it in our schools? Better learning means less hesitancy vis-a-vis medicine, and you end up with trained people in case of emergenvy, or who can treat small issues without clogging the hospitals. In my opinion the vaccine is not the only solution, and we have to be prepared in case something other/worse comes in. In our situation we didn't learn from covid and our approach are still the same.
We have this chance of improving all the system, why not do it? Because convincing someone to get a vaccine through media and repressing them will only push them further from the idea. And to be honsest the media isn't helping.
A lot of people do not have faith in the medical system, since even before the covid, waiting times were horrible in hospitals and you were treated there like a number.
However I still believe that life is grey, but the media and social media are portraying it as black or white.
There needs to be a balance, why is there such high priority for COVID patients when there are more serious issue patients too?
Weird how the vaccination status of those infected isn’t brought up.
This is why people hate anti vaxers
The unvaxxed should be redirected to special 'U-Serve Covid-Centers' where the unvaxxed doctors and nurses all work.
Something I never see brought up with this kind of stuff is the influx of immigrants we have coming into Canada without upgrading our infrastructure.
I'm all for immigration... but we need to make sure we're upgrading our country to support new Canadians.
We need to push people into the medical field, so we have enough people and we upgrade our facilities. 
I feel like this was a problem before covid and now it is obviously worse.
Why does she need to be in ICU in her post-op rather than acute care? Sounds like bullshit to me
There better not be beds taken up by those who refuse to vaccinate. Just saying.
"what does it matter if I don't get vaccinated, it's my body my choice".
Sure, but your people are disproportionately clogging up our ICUs, and throwing off elective surgeries, cancer screenings and treatments, and things like this and so much more.
Every time I read this sub I’m amazed at the fucking stupidity of most Canadians.
I know the Nautical Science program at BCIT was very popular. It's one of the careers I was strongly considering but decided it would make family life far too difficult.  
As with most industries that complain about shortages, I'd bet if they committed to strong on-the-job training for people without post-secondary, or offered to pay for the post secondary training up front, I'm sure they'd get the recruits they're looking for.
Canadian seafarers simply cannot compete internationally when seafarers from developing countries are paid so little and seafarers from other developed countries (UK for example) don't pay income tax. 
A Canadian onboard an offshore vessel working internationally will receive 30-40% less net salary compared to British coworkers, there is simply no incentive for being away from your family 6+months of the year working 12 hours per day in usually stressful environments, fatigue in seafarers is an ongoing problem. 
The domestic industry is extremely limited, your options are working on the great lakes, offshore NS or NFL or the Coast Guard. 
I am a Canadian with a British license and the bureaucracy around obtaining a Canadian license is ridiculous. It takes months to have your documents assessed and then you only are given 12 months to meet all the requirements (additional exams and courses which only run a limited number of times per year). 
It is simply not feasible especially when you're on a vessel for 6 of those months.
This is an older article, however we are still critically short on personnel in the industry. High paying careers are to be had for those motivated. 
Ordinary Seaman (deckhands) and other unlicensed crew on the Great Lakes are exempt from MED requirements for their first 6 months, all you need is a marine medical and a discharge book. 
To become a deck officer or engineer, the completion a 3 year cadet program is required, plus 1 year of sea service as a cadet. The NSCC offers these programs at their Port Hawkesbury campus. There are also schools in Newfoundland, Ontario, BC and Quebec. There are also shorter Bridgewatch Rating courses that will get you qualified to sail as an Able Seaman.
Employment Nova Scotia offers a skills development program that will pay for most, or all of your schooling expenses. Maybe other provinces have a similar program?
 https://novascotia.ca/employmentnovascotia/programs/skills-development.asp
Going to sea was the best decision I ever made. My career on the Great Lakes has given me everything I wanted in life and allows me to comfortably support my family.
Once again another artificial shortage, too much training and hardship to become employed in a particular industry, then call it a “shortage’
This is something I would have been interested in back when I finished high school. It would be nice if our education system would make teens more aware that this is an option rather than pushing everyone towards university.
I sailed as a night cook, second cook and chief cook, 18 years. It's great money, sure, time off sure, but the bullshit that goes with the job is not worth it. Cut back on crew, but more workload, more so called guests staying on board, if your a smoker, forget about it, your smoking outside, not in the comfort of your room. You want to go ashore to shop for personal needs. Expensive cab rides, there and back. Usually docks for loading and unloading are in the middle of no where land. But chances are she rolls in at midnight someplace, your working the next day, and that's it, she leaving the dock in a few hours. Let's see, if the usual backstabbing, pretend friendships and disgusting behavior of some of the crew isn't  enough to turn you off,  the long hours, than perhaps the lack of sleep, working 7 days a week, 12-14 hour days, some work more, some less, on your vacation you smell like deisal and grease no matter how many times you shower, spending the first week getting your land legs back, spending your hard earned cash, paying to save a broken relationship that sooner or later can't be saved. If this sounds like something you might enjoy, pursue your dreams. And that's just the tip of it.
Not many people signing up for a domestic industry like that when they see all the ships changing flags...
I never even thought of this when I was younger.  I suppose there wasn’t as much of a need then.
Do they hire tradespeople and can I work as one onboard a ship?
Maybe launch a migrant worker program? 🤔
It is hard on the family life, it was definitely easier when I was young and single. However there's no way I'd make this kind of money working ashore. The plus side is that when I'm home, I'm home. I get months off at a time to be completely engaged with my family. 
Some companies will help pay for the courses people need to upgrade their licenses. Some companies also offer large bonuses for anyone who does upgrade their license.
The problem with paying for peoples schooling outright is the very high drop out rate. My class started with 28 people, only 8 finished the 3 years of schooling and only 6 actually got their license.
>I'd bet if they committed to strong on-the-job training for people without post-secondary, or offered to pay for the post secondary training up front
I'd commit to a life on the seas in an instant if someone did that.
I bet they also don’t want to pay more then he absolute minimum they can get away with
> Murley has already been offered a lucrative job from a shipping company, including money to cover the rest of his education.
Well seems like one guy in the article is getting funding.
TC is pretty ridiculous to be honest.
There is lots of work on the Lakers, every company up here is crying for people in all positions.
What about the Arctic? Not that I'm interested, jw about the shipping ups to remote areas.
Wow. Thank you so much for the info. I feel like it might be a little late for me though.
>High paying careers are to be had for those motivated. 
What's considered high paying in your industry?
I've always wanted to get into the industry, but I'm not sure where to look. It would be super cool if you could provide me with some links to get started within the great lakes area.
Unlicensed crew can start with no training and minimal up front expenses.
Of course that’s what the cost savings are
There is absolutely no reason for the Rogers takeover of Shaw to be approved. Everything Rogers has promised will be cut back or never realised. And that’s before we get to the reduction of competition in an already uncompetitive market.
Has there ever been a single merger ever that didnt lead to cutting a bunch of duplicate staff?
Mergers cost jobs and make shit more expensive, why do we keep pretending otherwise?
Obviously.
**May?**
The best way to maximize profits is to be a monopoly.
In theory, job cuts should lead to price reductions in a competitive market. But, we know the Canadian telecom industry is an oligopoly, so really, the benefits of this new efficiency will only accrue to the shareholders. Workers get fucked, customers get nothing, owners get richer.
*MAY* 
They seriously think we are all idiots... The only way this could try will ever be able to reign in these telecoms is through nationalization
That’s not the most important problem here!
Businesses will merge and reduce costs by laying off redundant staff. That in itself is not a problem. It’s inefficient to employ people doing tasks that do not need to be done.
The problem is the outsized pricing power this resulting entity will have, further raising prices and collecting rent.
“may” 
lol.
Well duh!
Has there ever been a merger that didn't?
Of all the variables in our economy, the loss of jobs from this deal are a guarantee
Is there a light at the end of the tunnel for appropriately priced internet and cellular service? Or will we be oppressed by the Robeltelus cartel forever?
No shit, that's the point. Then wait a year and Jack up prices. Thanks CRTC.
Says common sense
The question is - will any customers see those savings?
They're called "synergies" and are one of many factors in determining the bonuses paid to the M&A specialists.
Job cuts and refusing to guarantee that they won't increase fees.... sounds like a great deal..../s
> May lead to job cuts… 
They wouldn’t have it any other way. Less jobs, higher rates to consumers, less choice in the “free market”.
Thanks to Don Braid for covering this. Something needs to be done.
Govs think we can take kids out of bad situations, plop 'em in 'better' things'll work out
Kids need support of stable families. If families are spending their time at jobs/finding food\&amp;shelter, what do they have 'left in the tank' to stabilize kids? Start w supporting families
If you can't afford to take care of your children, don't have any in the first place.
But let’s worry about the 1 COVID death this week
Not only is the country failing these kids but ultimately destroying any chance for them to be productive, functioning adults. Child abuse and neglect is the leading cause for many mental health issues,  affects how you form relationships, and that this type of stress has long term implications on neurological and physiological development. This is controversial but perhaps the child benefit should be used towards benefiting all children rather than at the mercy of how the parents spend it. 
I used to help with those holiday fund a family type events but I had to stop. Every time our group would raise money for an awesome game system or something the kids wanted, the family would be thankful and happy. Then a few weeks later, we would find out the game system would be sold “to pay for bills” but the parents would just be smoking more or drinking more. It got tiring trying to help the kids have a fun holiday when their parents just took advantage of the situation and used it for selfish ends. Children deserve better. The cycle of poverty and abuse and neglect needs to end.
If they're dying of overdoses, maybe the problem is that more and more powerful drugs are hitting the streets. Trust the media to try to blame social workers, the only people who are trying to help these kids.
UCP supporters: we're pro-life.  We should not be allowing people to have abortions.  
Also UCP anti-abortion supporters: They made their choices. It's not our responsibility to care for them. 
This is why the anti-abortion crowd sucks. If you're not willing to see resources are adequate enough to sustain and nurture life, then why oppose abortion at all cost? Raped? Have the baby. Incest? Have the baby. Unstable, abusive relationship? Have the baby. Ask these people for financial or meaningful support,they're nowhere to be seen. They're too busy funding some anti-vaxx/anti-mask/pro-pipeline agenda, or building a megachurch.
We have thousands of couples waitlisted for adoptions and jammed pack foster homes. There's a pretty obvious solution.
Clearly the solution is to give more tax credits to oil companies
If kids are taken from their parents, it’s not because the parents spend too much time working.
People who can’t afford to raise children properly, but have them anyway, are the main cause of poverty.
What does that have to do with the children dying in government care??
Sometimes. I knew a few families that had their kids in foster care because neither parent wanted them once they got divorced. The half assed legal system would go back and forth between the parents while the kids waited in foster for years because no one wanted them.
"Only rich people should be allowed to have children."
Ok but this isn't the issue at hand.
>Also UCP anti-abortion supporters: They made their choices. It's not our responsibility to care for them. 
This is a bit of a strawman argument. We can and should have less kids in foster car, but the way to get there is by providing more options for adoptions. We have thousands of parents adopting from abroad, or waitlisted domestically. Then we have packed full foster homes of kids whose parents are unable to care for them. The solution is to get those kids into good homes, which we have plenty of.
If you are suggesting that the children be adopted, you are ignoring that parents and children have rights to remain in contact with each other, and the goal is family reunification.  Children aren't widgets that function the same if they're moved from one machine to another; there is real trauma involved in removing children from their families and  communities.
Also; people hoping to adopt usually want healthy newborns, not kids in the foster care system.
Maybe they should ban opioids from kids 16 to 19.
Thank you for this :)
The solution to all Alberta’s problems. Maybe they will donate some money to pay for better foster care! Or maybe they will pay shareholders. It’s hard to say.

Damn only 2.6% spoilage that's pretty good.
> Alberta reported disposing of 10 per cent of its doses
Why am I not surprised?
Does anyone know our cost per dose?
The third world countries are all suffering because they have no vaccine. This is shameful
Im guessing the expired ones were mostly AstraZen? Lots of people anecdotally refused to get it.
This is precisely why they need to offer boosters to those who want them.
Canada has administered 60 million doses.
While we don't want to have to discard any vaccine, it's a much less dramatic headline if we say "*Canadian vaccination programs experienced 2% wastage*".
Since governments are involved I’d expect a tremendous amount of waste.   We will never know the real number.
It's very easy. If you want to blame people for wastage blame the anti-vaxxers first.
They are the ones dodging their duty to vaccinate, dodging their duty to look out for their selves and the wellbeing of people around them.
*Heavy Breathing* - Anti Vaxxer probably
Meanwhile in South Africa....
Nah.
As of the date of that article, Alberta wasted approx. 675,000 of Canada's 1,016,669 wasted doses.
If you exclude Alberta, the national 2.6% wastage rate drops to less than 0.9%.
If the entire rest of the country can pull off a 0.9% rate, 2.6% is a complete disgrace in comparison.
A million babies that could have been vaccinated
Only AstraZeneca, at $8.18 per dose, only because it was revealed accidentally. The costs for other vaccines remain secret.
I had AZ for my 1st shot, would have taken it again for the 2nd but it wasn't offered anywhere.
🙄
Nah, it's even easier to just blame the vaxed for not becoming immune like social media implied using the word immunized. Don't bother replying because I don't care.
What about South Africa?
> If the entire rest of the country 
You didn't read the article. 
That's an informal count that doesn't include any data from Ontario, and there's no mention of other large provinces like Quebec and BC.
A diplomatic boycott?
That  means a whole bunch pf people are not going to get a free ride and expenses to be spectators at an Olympics??
We should never have had diplomatic attendees anyway.
A full boycott is necessary. If our elected officials are unwilling to act, we must boycott the Olympics as individual Canadians.
Don't go. I'm all for recognizing our Olympians but not China for it's human rights abuses.
This is what we're reduced to? Diplomatic boycotts are the most that can even be contemplated? Who cares or even notices if foreign politicians attend the Opening Ceremonies of the Olympic Games?
meaningless theatre
We should be boycotting almost everything to do with China. They're the Nazi Germany of our generation.
With Beijing’s treatment of Canada and the threat of this new Omicron variant, there is only one prudent course of action:
Prop up the housing market.
Then Beijing can BAN international student visa to Canada.
Been boycotting all things IOC since experiencing the utter bullshittery of Vancouver 2010. 
It’s just one massive grift for CoSports and elitist.
Who gives a shit? If we're not willing to fully boycott then we're not willing to say anything meaningful.
We shouldn't be participating in these games *at all*. China is run by murderers and they are staging the Olympics to reinforce their hold on power. The CCP would have hissy fit over it, but they can all get fucked. The don't deserve a seat at the same table as democratically elected governments.
Will not be watching the Olympics.
Remember to thank the CCP for the current state of the world!
Unlikely given the Trudeau Liberal groveling towards the Chinese Communist Party.
There is no way Trudeau would go against China in any form.
CPC commentators are triggered this morning.
Why not let the Canadian men's/women's hockey teams spank the absolute crap out of the Chinese?  Loosing face like that would hurt a lot more than a symbolic diplomatic move.
I hope so. I feel bad for our athletes, but this is a stand we need to take as a country!
Fuck  Xi and her terrorist gang of war criminals. The Uyghur people are suffering a genocide  , concentration camps are being run and another holocaust is taking place.
Where's Peng Shuai?
With our experience with the two Michael's and hostage diplomacy and now missing Peng Shuai, it is not safe for our athletes to go to China.
It will never happen. No one wants to re-visit a war that had vague and unachievable objectives, where troops were sent in by a government initially to avoid an even worse deployment to Iraq, and kept there by another government to score political points at home, without armour or airlift capability, and initially even without desert camo.
Calling it "Canada's Vietnam" may be overstating the case, but it was ill-advised, pointless, and a waste of lives, money and opportunity.
I think a key point to bring up is how some NATO nations did their role, some punched above their weight while others did as little as humanely possible.
How about ways to evacuate the abandoned people overland? Any plans in place?
All nations should be discussing what went down IMO whether it's Estonia or Germany.
Imagine all the useful stuff that could have been paid for instead of throwing it into a money pit. The government is always complaining that they can't afford to fight poverty, or invest more in healthcare or education, or switch to renewable energy, etc., but somehow that money just manifested when it came time to send troops to Afghanistan.
It was a NATO mission, was it not? Let NATO do it. 
The real stick in the eye for a lot of people (I suspect Brewster, the author) is that NATO lost their foothold in that part of Eurasia. The true shame is the [quarter of a million dead.](https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/human/civilians/afghan)
It was a fiasco from start to finish, and was unwinnable under any circumstance. They live there, we do not. They only ever needed to wait.
Holy shit. 
If the Dutch are looking into it... you know it's bad. 
I mean... Rwanda. 
That was the Dutch.
Not our problem
So now they're gonna have to buy a microscope.
US*
But it would have to start with us admitting we had no noble ambitions - Chretien just didn't want to be roped into Iraq so he got us into Afghanistan. Those who served deserve all our respect, and those who put them in the conflict and kept them there for all the wrong reasons deserve all our endless disrespect.
Obviously.
 The largest military adventure of the last two decades. 
Executed by a coalition of the wealthiest nations led by the only hyper-power. 
Ended in complete catastrophe. 
Over $1 trillion wasted. Over 250,000 dead.
If someone's not looking into that then someone's not doing their job.
Vietnam was at least defending an invasion.
I think the goals were vague because the stated ones were not the real ones. Afghanistan is smack in the middle of Iran, Russia (via some stans) and China--a Belt Road nexus point and control of that was the real prize. 
It is a modern center of a [Mackinder island.](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-mackinders-heartland-theory-4068393) where it was once Ukraine if China's economic weight didn't shift that center Eastwards.
Now China is free to stabilize Afghanistan and run high speed rail through it. The US will have a tougher time destabilizing Xinjiang, which is very close too.
That is not what they talk about but MacKinder island is lost to them now and that is huge.
Not sure what we can do for them. We have no ability to do stuff inside Afghanistan anymore. The only thing that might work is if they can escape/Taliban let them flee to Pakistan and we can help them pretty easily from there.
It's not that hard to figure out.
A punitive mission against terrorists that should have lasted a couple weeks became a "nation building mission" with no reasonable endgame, no exit strategy, and only half-hearted support for the installed government.
No, a lot of them in fact do not live there
I'm not sure what criteria you set for what constitutes "winning" but we did what we set out to do.  If it weren't for Trump, the Taliban would have been in shambles and ISIS would have been smashed.  Not defeated, because you can't defeat a global organization with conventional warfare, but certainly driven out of Afghanistan with the kinds of costly losses that will make them think twice about launching large scale attacks on the US and allied countries in the future.
That, and putting a bullet in Bin Laden's head.
Calling it a "fiasco" is not only ignorant, it's profoundly disrespectful to the service men and women who accomplished the things they did.
At least get your countries right.
Albania is a fine country and they’ll integrate perfectly , why don’t they stay there, refugees don’t get to pick and choose where they go , they go where it’s safe and that’s that
What did they expect with Justin Trudeau in charge?
Cmon Justin. We need these 'fugees to work jobs Canadians won't because wages are too low. Who will ensure record profits for corps if you aren't depressing wages?
barbari > bannock
Because Canada needs these immigrants to work all the jobs that are currently available that aren't paying a living wage. Yay, let's make things worse!
That’s what TFWs are for. Bringing in refugees from war torn countries doesn’t help Canada.
Why don’t we go back to the good ol days where teenagers worked those jobs to get work experience and make some spending money.
Working fast food, grocery store or pumping gas were all entry level jobs.
Were being the key word. My partner and I had a discussion around that very thing the other week, how those jobs should be for kids who need life experience; not people who are grown adults trying to fund their lives.
Edit: spelling
Way to go boys. Sturgeon are magnificent creatures.

And then she promptly performed an open heart procedure. Amazing...hold on, Im being told it's actually a type of fish.
Awesome
they are! like modern days dinosaurs
Guess you're writing all the new Animal Crossing jokes then, eh?
Those dikes don't like to be stressed out
Why do people forget about chilliwack being under a flood watch back around 2010 because of excess snow melt. This has been an issues for way longer then anyone in charge wants to admit.
No one is in charge, is why. They knew for years.
So I guess BC is the real Texas of Canada?
SHOCKING REVELATION: Most bathtubs will overflow if you fill them with too much water.
If you drain a lake and build at the bottom of this lake don't act surprised when that shyt flooded. 
No one is willing to call out this bs, instead they are chanting global warming where it does not belong.
If you poke a hive you get stung
INB4: blame the Liberals for not doing anything while ignoring the fact that the NDP has been in power since 2017
2015 was global warming....no rain or snow there.
I didn't know they had dikes. Are there lots of dikes?
But... the overflow drain! You know that funny shiny shield like thing at the front of the tub?!
I have never seen a bathtub without an overflow drain
Both things can be true.
In which time they've dealt with pipeline issues, a pandemic, massive fires...
Yeah, most don't drain fast enough.
They don't always work.
If only our governments could do more than one thing at a time eh?
Really? Do you have a story you want to share?
That can, but there's still limits especially when these things affect the availability of skilled personnel, access, and funds.
The word unprecedented gets thrown around a lot but the combination of shit hitting BC over the last several years has been crazy
he doesnt
just lies to fit his prerogative
Christ on a bike, the infrastructure is riding on a thin line.
That is an older photo. Crews have done a LOT of work since then. Here's a [more recent photo](https://flickr.com/photos/tranbc/51706794728/) that was taken only 4 days after OP's photo. The BC Ministry of Transport has a lot of [photos of the work being done](https://flickr.com/photos/tranbc) on all the repairs.
If you have the time, take a look at what going on with Highway 5 (Coquihalla) in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsUxzRHEHjI
We're often critical of how long it takes Governments and contractors to act. But in this case the BC Transportation ministry, rail companies, and contractors are making some great progress.
[You can see a ton of progress photos on various highways and roads here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tranbc/)
[source](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tranbc/51698456868/in/photostream/)
Highways in BC are and always have been miraculous. The landscape is not conducive to travel.
Unreal how all of Fibre to millions of people was riding on one highway. I'm now confident it's this way in a lot of places. Yikes.
How current is that pic?  The foundations on the trestle look dodgy AF
Looking at the erosion at the bottom left, can't believe any of that slope is stable
it looks like the movie set for temple of doom.
Nice photo, reminiscent of Ed Burtynsky.
I assume that location is repaired already seeing CP was running trains yesterday and CN plans on running trains today. Hopefully the repairs hold up to the rain that’s expected to come.
rocks the size of cars is the long term fix, not more gravel and pillers into the bed rock
It's the geography of the Province, and it's only going to become more vulnerable. And there is no magical bullet. There are limits to how much you can engineer anything that effectively cuts into the sides of canyons and mountains.
One dead chinee for every mile of track...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE3ISzalVuo
It’s wild. I’m surprised they saved that rail bridge. I guess the piles weren’t affected and go way deeper than what’s exposed
I appreciate that those photos weren't taken with potatoes.
Damn, those images of highway 8 are insane! How on earth are they going to repair all of that, the river is where the road used to be.
Wow - it IS just a series of tubes. I always thought it was something you could just dump something on, like a big truck. Huh.
There's three highways, 1,3 and 5 that go through the southern interior. Number 5 is the high capacity route, but its had multiple bridge washouts
It's been cut a few time, about 3 years ago there was some kind of cave in that cut the line and caused massive outage.
I was working for tech support back then for a company who's product depend on telecommunication and customer were surprise to learn their internet were down, they never check properly...
Look closer, there is no support under a small part of that track on the right and a much longer limp noodle on the left. That would in no way support a train. There is another route along Hwy 5 that was used, but I believe it got shut down again

I wish we’d seriously consider tidal energy. Bay of fundy has the highest tides in the world, more water flows through there then all of the rivers in the world combined, there’s a considerable amount of energy that could be harvested but we aren’t considering it as a serious option.
I’m glad we will make Emera money, while local rates climb YoY
We export everything else we could use, might as well export our electricity as well. We'll probably export it and buy it back at an increased price.
In Maine lobster fishermen are a massive barrier to offshore wind. Lobster fishermen aren't a less powerful lobby group in NS by any means.
Excellent!
It's worth considering. Could be a good option to supplement the grid, even if it doing it at a large scale turns out to be a bad idea.
It isn't a wind turbine exporting region anymore
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.5548428
🤣
Better hope hurricane visits don't become more frequent.
Kind of like how Europe is having such a good time with theirs….when are people going to wake up.
Hydro-Q and the Province won't stand for that
*when it's windy
So NS want to exterminate birds and destroy their tourism industry now?
There was a demonstration project a few years ago but it looks like it turned into a bit of a disaster with the turbine getting damaged and the company going bankrupt.
https://globalnews.ca/news/4644316/cape-sharp-tidal-turbine-damaged/
It was seriously considered. It's not a great option.
There is at least one company working on it. They have encountered a lot of issues because it's a new technology, but I am hoping they make it work eventually. Sometimes these things take time to get right
They've tried numerous prototypes but the bay keeps on destroying them. The last one went bankrupt and left Nova Scotia on the hook for millions of dollars to remove it from the water. 
There's also a lot of opposition to it from environmental activists.
All the river combined? Damn that's insane and mind blowing!
It looks like they did a feasibility study in the 70s that cited a potential 5k MW from the bay of fundy alone.
And here we see the native .22 caliber beginning its annual migration to Compton. Though smaller than it's 9mm and .45 counterparts, it's diminished size grants it unparalleled aerial agility as it makes the annual trip down south for the winter.
Kind of a strange headline. Bullets don't "fly" on their own. A more descriptive headline would be "RCMP detachment in B.C. fired upon"
Has ammunition become sentient?
anyone look into what the fire department was doing at the time? might be getting some revenge for the RCMP doing a mag dump and run of a firehall in NS
Better check the GPS of which RCMP car was in the area, they may have mistaken it for a firehall.
Maybe someone thought it was a firehall where innocent people were sheltering?
It was just a desk pop.
Smelled gunpowder, eh? Bullshit.
Judging by how the RCMP can shoot up a firehall with no repercussions then shooter in this situation must allowed to get away scot free.
Stop resisting.
Read the article, did an RCMP employee accidently fire off their weapon in the office? That doesn't seem like a very safe workplace...
RCMP and local police often times have quite a vivid imagination. I wouldn’t be surprised of reports of “flying bullets”.
PPC supporter?
I don't know anything about guns so how is 22 smaller than 9?
Or alternatively:
"B.C. RCMP detachment gets the N.S. fire hall treatment"
Need that hard hitting frantic prose
Lmao stop
Gator needs his gat
Any of you read?  Someone shot up the detachment in vanderhoof. Shot through the windows there was 12 people working in the building.
https://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/r2f2cm/police_capturing_the_shooter_in_vanderhoof/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Really?
Seems dystopian... this doesn't seem like a positive story.
I'd be thrilled if I finally have coverage for my medical conditions compared to not having the coverage.
A Calgary City Councillor raped a teenager at gunpoint. 
>"During the course of the sexual assault, in order to overcome her resistance to the sexual assault, he produced his Calgary Police Service handgun.”
>Chu said he didn’t know she was 16 at the time because they were in a licensed establishment that would have barred minors.
That doesn't mean shit - that particular venue (Husky House) was known for not exactly being on top of verifying patron's ages, and he was **a police officer who was on-duty**.
Disgusting behaviour, and he should have been charged with a crime instead of the onus being on the victim to have to file a civil suit.
C’mon guys he said sorry, it’s not like the legal system can do anything more here. Victims just need to just stop victiming and criminals will stop criminackening.
Pervert.
Oh, ok, so that makes it ok /s
That makes his sex crimes against a minor all better eh!
Oh Chu, you're such a garbage human being. Did you apologize to your wife after pointing your gun at her too and threatening to kill yourself if she left you (which she did)?
Just resign you piece of shit.
So this guy groomed and raped a child but he said *sorry*?
Good lord this human is despicable. There has to be a way he can be removed from serving on council.
I think this police officer should be commended for apologizing.
Most police officers do not apologize after destroying someone's life.
Great to see that both sides exercised restraint and no life was taken - Blue Lives Matter.
Remember folks this was one bad apple. So you should move along. Where both sides vaccinated?
The point of the article is to highlight Reddit whataboutary when minorities talk about the systematic racism.
That's depraved.
He lied about everything - he said he met her at a pub, but he met her at Husky House which is a restaurant and NOT an 18+ establishment. The article below has better details.
[In a statement to CTV News on Monday, Chu maintains he did not know the girl was underage saying, “in 1997 when I was 34 years old, I met a woman at a licensed establishment where all persons are required to be 18 years of age or older and show identification. A witness confirmed Mr. Chu’s account of the facts and an internal hearing found that her allegations were without merit.”](https://calgary.ctvnews.ca/documents-reveal-sean-chu-admitted-to-consensual-sexual-acts-with-teen-girl-while-a-calgary-police-officer-1.5628292)
[However, information obtained by CTV News indicates that the girl was not at an 18-plus licensed establishment, but that she was at a restaurant called the Husky House and Chu was only there at the request of another officer to drive the girl home when he touched her leg. CTV News has learned that instead of dropping her off at her home, he took her to his home where the girl alleged he sexually assaulted her and where she alleged Chu pulled out his Calgary Police Service handgun.](https://calgary.ctvnews.ca/documents-reveal-sean-chu-admitted-to-consensual-sexual-acts-with-teen-girl-while-a-calgary-police-officer-1.5628292) 
[Furthermore, according to information obtained by CTV News, Chu had met the girl during an unrelated police investigation when she was 14 years old, two years before the sexual encounter.](https://calgary.ctvnews.ca/documents-reveal-sean-chu-admitted-to-consensual-sexual-acts-with-teen-girl-while-a-calgary-police-officer-1.5628292)
>most of canada 
*sigh* no change for vancouver then
Boy would that ever be nice.
Finally the transitory inflation is over!
And by Christmas week it will have risen to around 20% more than current prices.
This is just wool being pulled, don't fall for it folks.
Yeah, only to go up $.50 by new year’s
Thanks Omicron
Anything higher than 1.00 per liter is too high. There's not a real difference between fucking me in the ass and fucking me in the ass slightly less
Oh good. Inflation will be less noticeable if the number that everyone sees everywhere every day is lowered.
up 3-4 cents from yesterday in bc
Time to stock up!
Down 3cents today in Regina Saskatchewan.
Thanks Trudeau
If it goes down to around a dollar again im buying a tank truck and draining all of my accounts and maxxing out my credit cards. I usually spend $30 every 2 days for work. Its now up to $45. Fuckin ridiculous. Over $50 more a week. $250 extra this last month. Sure stings
Doubtful.
Fake news!
The headline is abit skewed. Oil flash-crashed on Friday. It just so happened to be a 1/2 day of trading after US markets were closed Thanksgiving. Also, last Friday of the month. Oil will be back up very soon. As will the pumps.
I think there should be supply management for gas. $6/L for gas because it is just so hard for Husky and Cenovus to compete. We should let the hardworking gas corporations set the price independent of international markets. 
/s if anybody was wondering.
There'll be a change all right - Vancouver prices will rise to make up for the losses across the rest of Canada.
CPI is going back to 2% in December, pfew !
So don't fill up my car at a cheaper price because I would have been duped?
* flooding on Sumas Prairie in British Columbia has ruined farmers' land, crops and homes
* story details one family's experience over the summer heat wave and subsequent flooding this fall
* speaking more generally, about 4000 tons of stored and unharvested vegetables have been ruined in Sumas Prairie and Fort Langley
* blueberry farmers also affected (blueberries are Canada's top fruit export)
   * a large portion of this crop is grown in Abbotsford -- there are worries for next year's crop and because of the nature of blueberry-growing, crop yields could be affected for the next six years
My comments: This is something we should all be worried about: the Fraser Valley is British Columbia's breadbasket and  one of Canada's key growing areas; its flooding directly affects the food security and economic well-being of British Columbia, specifically, and Canada, generally.
Weather and crop destruction like this is also coming for other parts of Canada in the near- and mid-term.
Vertical grow solutions. They ain’t pretty, but we gonna need em
If the former Sumas Lake area is prone to flooding with extreme precipitation, would it be a good idea to diversify our farmland/food production areas?  Instead of relying on one main agricultural area, (that would otherwise be underwater without a monumental amount of engineering intervention) we should have many smaller agricultural zones throughout the Province to supplement these flood-prone areas, and increase our regional food security.
The part I found alarming was even when the water leaves, there will be worries of contamination in the soil. A lot of pollutants are in that water, how it will effect crops is yet to be seen. People really should consider growing a garden next spring our veggies are surely due to rise in cost because of this.
I don't want to alarm anyone, but the flooding has also damaged marijuana crops.
Can’t drain a lake and wounded why you flood out
Interesting context: a short video about flooding around Abbotsford, BC
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiC5QURBYmQ
I am curious what percentage of this are feeds BC, what percent feeds Canada (west, central & east) and what percent feeds the world. I didnt see that in the article but depending on those figures it could have major consequences for years to come
Time to build a wall to prevent American water from ruining our crops
You’re really killin it with these summations 👍
Only if cost is no issue. And with vertical farms, costs are no issue!
Its unlikely people are going to be willing to pay the cost of food grown in a vertical farm. Our food staples like grain, potatoes, and beans are better grown outdoors and ship easily. The produce that grows in greenhouses are usually things people can just cut out. Not many people would pay $20 for a pint of blueberries.
Not many areas in Canada with temperate temperatures all year long. And that's just the obvious limiting factor.
That is a good idea. There's also the fact that the flooding in the Fraser Valley was in part caused by flooding of the Nooksack River in Washington State; something Canada had no control over. See for example: 
https://bc.ctvnews.ca/trudeau-and-biden-discussed-problem-of-floodwaters-spilling-into-b-c-from-wash-state-1.5684122
There is agriculture all over the province but not everything grows everywhere.   The things we grow in the valley are likely things that do not (or it's not efficient ) to grow in the Okannagan.  We can't grow tree fruits well in the lower mainland  (well not yet, climate change might change that)
Very good point. I hadn't thought of that.
Good.
thank you, kind Redditor :)
I think being underwater is also a limiting factor.
Why is that good?
its the teenagers that have it the worst. They will remember the time before covid that will never return, kids adapt and accept because they dont know any different
Great timing Omicron, did you not think of the kids?  What a thoughtless bastard you are.
[Some of you may die, but it's sacrifice I am willing to make](https://youtu.be/hiKuxfcSrEU)
I've given up. People who wanted the shot have it and COVID is not going away. Let's keep the borders semi shut down until it's truly over but policing the population is truly pointless
Time for EEEVVVVVVEEERRYYOOOONNEE to get back to normal.
Inb4 some pedantic Redditor is Pedantic.
> The recent Health Canada approval of the Pfizer vaccine for children ages 5 to 11 is good news, as long as it is used to support, and not further restrict, children. It is important to leave space for families to make informed decisions based on their personal contexts, and not to use this as an opportunity to impose vaccine mandates on school children.
It takes them a very long time to reach their main point. Remember their first point, though: the vaccine is safe and effective. The sooner we immunize, the sooner life returns to normal and all of the other points they ramble on about become moot.
Oh my gawd a well reasoned logical article from mainstream media not calling for vaccine mandates for children. Can’t it be Canada that you are getting out of your Covid hangover?
Omicron?
> According to  a pre-print study that compiled multi-country data, the chance a child will be hospitalized if infected is between one in 500 and one in 1,000. 
So when you do the math that is a massive unnecessary load on the hospitals without even considering the possible long term side efforts from having it.
[deleted]
Yes they do. I have 2 teenagers now and at the start of this pandemic I had one. My daughters friend became seriously depressed to the point of self harm since most teenage girls are very social people who love being in groups and doing things as said group. 
I have been genuinely far more concerned for those under 18 the longer this goes on. It may be time to face the reality that as we are vaccinating young people we need to rapidly get life back to normal for the sake of the mental health of millions of Canadians. 
If need be lock up the elderly and those severely at risk of serious harm and boost them every six months. They are a much smaller group and far easier to protect.
remember preAIDS?  it was dope
\*doubt*
At this point I'd prefer for any promise of normalcy that  you base on assumed science, to actually be based on real science.
So let's wait for real evidence that vaccines will end it, like how many boosters do we need, what level of vaccination is required, what will normal be like then and so forth.
Its an opinion piece in the national post
always gonna be variants. always gonna be people not boostered up to the latest update.
gotta move on.
The new enemy of Optimus Prime.

Please cite the full paragraph
> Yet even this risk may be an overestimate: according to a study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal , nearly 40 per cent of children who were considered hospitalized with COVID-19 in 2020 were there for unrelated reasons. Furthermore, data from Public Health England found that unvaccinated children are at a lower risk of hospitalization when compared with fully vaccinated 40–49-year-olds. And the delta variant, while more transmissible, does not appear to cause more severe disease in children or adults .
I don't believe this data.  The number of deaths under 18 is virtually zero.  If there were that many hospitalizations I would expect many more deaths, unless they are just precautionary ER visits.
How many of these hospitalizations = ICU?
Inflation is affecting me much more than the virus.  Inflation doesn't care about our feelings, but it fucks us a lot harder than this stupid virus unless you're an 80 year old on reddit.
The virus also doesn't really seem to do much of anything to the infinitely vast majority of healthy people who make healthy choices. Maybe these people should get their lives back. Just saying...

being a sub sucks bad
you dont get regular hours and they treat you like garbo
I applied they would not hire me. I teach at a private college right now.
Yeah I'm a student teacher right now and the school I work at is desperate for subs
We got 70 year old retirees working almost every day of the week because there is no one else. Teacher morale is not good
Just awful. I subbed for a couple of years after UNI. They call you at 6AM sporadically to show up 2 hours later at some random school in the county. Pay sucks balls too. Not to mention the catty asshole teachers treat you like dirt because you are a "part timer". God forbid I end up working at an elementary school as a male. Misandry is a real issue in that field. Cant believe anyone would do that job.
Most of the subs in my district are 70+ , lol.
Imagine a 75 year old teaching high school students.
too bad they chased me out of the profession during the last teacher shortage decades ago....😩
Please stop complaining on the media that you cant find anyone to work for you.  It is not the pandemic fault.  It is only your fault.
And this is good for every business right now that has a manpower shortage.   Offer more and you will not have a problem to hire and keep people.
The pay vs educational requirement is brutal. makes no financial sense to be a teacher right now.
Article Summary:
* Depending where you're living in Canada, a shortage of teachers has been a perennial issue for schools. However, COVID-19 has made it worse, spreading the problem to more classrooms and prompting education experts to call for both short-term solutions as well as longer-lasting efforts to fill the gap.
* In areas where a shortage of educators is most pronounced, district officials may be relying on hiring uncertified teachers. This can be difficult decision, since a certified teacher typically spends five to six years specifically studying for a career in education in college or university, and continually upgrades with professional development and new training.
* Some areas in B.C. are employing uncertified staffers in classrooms "not just on a day-by-day basis, but all year long,"
* Ontario's Durham District school board posted an ad searching for "uncertified emergency teachers."
* Provinces and territories have made slight moves to address the issue. For example, the Ontario government announced in early 2021 it would temporarily allow students close to completing teacher-education programs to work as teachers.
* Retired teachers have traditionally been the most reliable source for substitute teachers. However, many recently retired teachers — typically aged 56 to 65 years old, he said — have declined to accept substitute gigs during the pandemic because of the increased risk of illness due to their age.
* Educational consultant and researcher, Paul Bennett wants to see boards building squads of high-quality substitutes by offering more security, opportunities for career development and potential for promotion.
~~substitute~~ teacher shortages 
Yet universities continue to make it prohibitively difficult to get into teaching programs
"Substitute teacher shortages are plaguing schools during the pandemic"
So, a substitute teacher pandemic?
When I was a kid, there were two kinds of subs: the bad ones who started the day by putting the heading "Detentions" on the rightmost edge of the board as a warning and then just wrote entire lessons on the board and demanded the class follow along and copy it down.
Then there were the good ones who had no control over the class but they were really nice.  It wasn't entirely uncommon for us to send them home at the end of the day in tears.
Either you get paid more than you're worth or you don't get paid nearly enough.  Hardly ever a middle ground, it seems.
* Low pay.
* Low or no benefits.
* Low status.
* Precarious work.
I can’t believe these selfish people are not lining up for this opportunity! They are almost as bad our other heroes, those selfish nurses not taking a pay cut on top of exposing themselves to PPE shortages, long hours, and violent antivaxxers.
BRB going to bang some pots to make up for it.
We call them supply teachers in these parts.

Interesting is it regional or something? I know a person who's son is a sub, he just recently complained to her that he is struggling to get the hours he wants. Luckily he is 62 so can just retire and does it only for the love of teaching. He was an engineer for years so his pension is nice and fat but he just wants to teach a few more years. Can't get work right now.
Mandates may be a contributing factor.

ONLINE LEARNING UNTIL THE PANDEMIC IS OVER!!!!!
This is always an unpopular opinion, online and in real life but ...I just don't get the whole excitement for "best" bagels.  I've tried them all.  People are always, "THIS is the best bagel, just wait" and I try it and every single time I think, "yup, that's a bagel".  NY, Montreal, coffee shop, grocery store, they're all fine.  Maybe my bagel pallet is unrefined???
Montreal bagels can't be beat
I was someone who never cared much about bagels, and treated them like any other form of bread. On one of my trips to Montreal, I was just walking by that St Viateur shop with a friend who stopped to grab some bagels. He got half a dozen, and as we left the store he pulled one out of the bag and offered me. Not being much a bread person I first declined considering there was nothing to eat the bagel with, but then I was like sure I’ll have one, seeing how he started eating one himself. And boy… I have no clue how to describe the taste/texture but that half-a-dozen was devoured in no time, it was sooooo good. 
I’ve never really had NY bagels, but I can say that Montreal bagels are special.
Growing up in Montreal, I didn't know how bad bagels were in other places.
Americans almost all hate Montreal bagels. To them, bagel is bread, like to make sandwiches. Every few years some avant garde foodie renegade will write an article like this but it won't change regional preferences.
Montreal bagels can be used that way but it's a bit too chewy for that purpose. They're better enjoyed open face, lightly dressed (cream cheese and lox for example or just a shmear).
I worked in the food industry and your taste is very largely dependent on your memory. If you grew up eating one or the other, the other will clash with your expectations.
People like to say Montreal bagels because in the food world "Name of place + food item" = exotic. Especially if that place is in another country.
MTL bagels are wood-fired so that's an extra dimension of flavor but they also don't travel well. I am in Ontario now and many places sell MTL bagels that are only maybe 24-36 hours old and frankly they're only half as good (if that) as buying them on site. NY bagels last days because again.....they're bread.
This author tried them at the shop so they were glorious. I wonder what they would think trying them a day or two later.
I don't have a preference either way as I have tried great examples of both. I would rather a sandwich on NY but would prefer MTL with cream cheese and lox which is how I like bagels.
Where does this jerk get off telling me what I think is wrong?
he's the one who's wrong
thank you to Montreal’s Jewish community for giving us so many Canadian staples
There was a small shop in Nelson BC Canada in 1978 run by a woman from Quebec. Those were the best bagels I have ever had.
I still love bagels 🥯
Montreal's bagels are the best.
>Montréal bagels are better than New York’s.
No shit, Sherlock!  Nothing beats Montreal bagels.
St-Viateur is by a long shot the best bagels. I'll die on that hill if I have too.
Best breakfast ever:
* St-Viateur bagel
* cream cheese
* smoked salmon from Iles-de-la-Madeleine
You can taste their particular ovens that have been at work forever. 
The taste of the smoke , the sweetness of the dough. 
Good shit.
Fairmount bagel is superior to St Viateur, no contest!
Bagels have the unique ability to be both gross and boring at the same time.
gryfes bagels
Montreal bagels are the best BUT New York bagels make for a better bagel breakfast sandwich.
Before clicking I was like "this better be about Montreal and St-Viateur"
Moose Jaw has the best bagels!
St Viateurs vs Fairmont?
I love the bagel man from st v but I was always curious about a taste test.
It’s definitely a regional thing, growing up in Alberta  I’ve never seen it here in my lifetime but I definitely did visiting family in Toronto.
Bagged milk isn’t weird. You’re weird for thinking it’s weird.
Not weird at all!! #MyOttawaChildhood
Immigrant here. Yes, most absolutely weird. Sorry 😐
I grew up with bagged milk, and even though I haven't drank milk in 15+ years (lactose intolerance) I still think seeing milk in anything but bags is what is really weird.
Whenever I stream cooking and I pull out the bagged milk my American friends go absolutely nuts with the questions and also so friendly jokes.
Do you use that jug only to hold milk bags? 
Do you keep 3 jugs one for each bag in the fridge?
Do you have gallon jugs like we do?
Are the bags always clear?
Does chocolate milk come in bags?
Do you have bagged OJ?
Does it last longer than carton milk?
I quit drinking milk and I miss it so much
I hated those bags... they leaked.
To me, this has always been a regional/population density issue. It sounds like this is a major thing in southern Ontario, which is where at least 25% of Canada's population lives.  Therefore, since a lot of people live in one area of Canada, there's a good chance that if you're talking to any random Canadian that they have experience bagged milk. However, if you were visiting Canada and were just in the west, you could drive for a week or two and never come across it.  
I have lived on the prairies and I only ever saw it once when we were visiting family in Edmonton (this would have been the early to mid-90s). I thought it was kinda weird, but then never saw it again after that.
Anybody who ever saw a cow would know milk comes in bags naturally, albeit not plastic ones.
I always wondered why milk cartons existed when we had perfectly good bags right there.
The only weird part is how my dad would put the bagged milk pitcher back in the fridge with only a few drops left, never wanting to change it.
Any studies out there about storing liquids in cheap plastic like this?
It’s not weird, u r weird for thinking it’s weird
BMILF!!!
My wife drinks lactose free milk.  As such, I personally drink about 1l every 2 weeks.  From the article:
> Bagged milk is sold only in four-litre allotments in Canada, which may be too much for some consumers, leading to unconsumed or spoiled milk.
I'm out.
How does someone regularly reseal the hole in the top of the pouch to prevent the milk from taking on the many other odors lingering in the fridge (onion, garlic, pizza, whatever)?   Do the jugs have a lid or something?
No, it's just weird. Other liquids that come in bags:
Blood/Plasma
Baby food
Colostomy runoff
Weird and disgusting
I grew up in Alberta starting from the age of 3.  We definitely had milk bags for a while and it was a dismal failure.  It was probably 45 years ago +/- 3 years.
I grew up in Saskatchewan in the 80s-90s. Never saw bagged milk there but I was aware of its existence due to having relatives in other parts of the country. I currently live in Ontario and we have bagged milk but I never buy it in the bags. I much prefer the cartons.
Studded tires are not permitted everywhere. They are allowed in Northern Ontario between September 1st and May 31st, but are not allowed on roads in Southern Ontario at all.
> "I have a solution for people getting rear-ended. Stay back further," said Brazil.
Huh? What?
I will say studded tires where a life saver for me driving on some of the highways out here in BC. They become a pure sheet of ice and even going at very slow speeds ( 15 - 30kph ) sliding off the highway is a real possibility. 
Now, are they perfect and needed for all situations? No, but for what they are designed for ( Ice ) they a fantastic addon for that that tiny bit of extra protection. 
Source: I used to drive across Canada for work in the middle of winter. Its saved my arse more than once while I watched other people slide off the highway.
Drove 1 winter without studs. Hit black ice and the ditch.  Drove 20 years with studs and saved many collision.  1000% better
ppl in the GTA cant drive on sunny days its a lot more  than the tires
If you live in northern Ontario yeah.
If you live in any major city like buddy in the article, you do not need studded tires, you need winters and to learn how to drive in the snow - that's it. 
The only folks who need studs are those who go through mountain passes or live up North. If your city has snowplows, you don't need studs.
I'm just going to say that for 90% of people out there, all weather tires are the best thing since sliced bread. They work all year round, hot summer or snow and ice. So many people are not yet familiar with them though, they are relatively new and have a 3 peak snow rating, which winter tires also have, they are not all seasons which have a misleading name and are not 3 peak snow rated. 
I put a set on our car, and I got the equivalent in all terrain tires for my SUV that I take off-road/overlanding, the Firestone Destination X/T, they are 3 peak snow rated and are amazing on snow, ice and dirt/mud.
I will never buy a set of dedicated winter tires again after my experience with them over the past couple of years.
You are allowed to drive on them in Southern Ontario if you’re visiting from out-of-province or a resident of Northern Ontario.
As long as your address is of a place that permits them you can drive on Toronto roads all you want.
He probably meant to say those DOING the rear ending, lol :)
yeah that guy is an idiot lmao
AFAIK the passes here in BC require winter tires during the winter,,  could be wrong though
Is that so? Everything I’ve seen says all seasons are trash compared to actual winter tires. You’re saying your all seasons perform the same as Michelin X-ices or the like?
Which ones do you have? I've looked into the Michelin Cross Climate 2.
Well they are good winter tires are better.
Are All Weather's and Mud/Snow the same thing?
I’m sure what he meant was “I have a solution for [the problem of] people getting rear-ended. [The following driver should] Stay back further.”
All weather tires are rated for winter, that is the 3 peak rating.
https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/driving-and-cycling/traveller-information/seasonal/winter-driving/about-winter-tires
It even says all weather tires are recommended.
There’s a difference between all weather and all seasons. All weathers are winter rated tires that can be ran year round. All seasons are not winter rated.

Anyways to confirm this or are we suppose to take you word for it?
I read the headline and thought it was a Beaverton story.
I didn't even know that we had a maple syrup reserve.
That's a lot of pancakes. 
Also TIL we have a maple syrup cartel in Quebec. 
Wonder if they ever go to war with the dairy cartel.
*The syrup must flow*
Soon we will use maple syrup as means of exchange for other goods.
Storing a product with a price that varies can be good business as long as it preserves well and isn't too expensive to store.  Add to storage when there is an excess and prices are lower.  Sell it when there is a shortage and prices are high.  It is similar with the U.S. strategic oil reserve -- they don't do it for investment purposes but if adding to the store and using it takes place at the right times, it can be financially beneficial.
Canada: I’m doing my part!
Canada, where syrup is worth more than the Canadian Dollar.
r/notthebeaverton
>Canadian maple syrup producers are tapping the country’s emergency reserve of the sticky sweet stuff as it looks to meet demand amid a global shortage.
Somehow
for some reason
I believe "reserve" is sufficient and we don't need to call the reserved supply of maple syrup an "emergency reserve"... you know?
&#x200B;
BC will be relieved that the "emergency reserve" was released...
This shortage wouldn't have happened if the west allowed for the syrup pipelines to be built. Now they can enjoy knowing that they eat pancakes with the unethical syrup of Myanmar.
Bought a big jug on clearance recently. Just like that it'll appreciate in value lol!
We should make sure not a drop goes to the US until they revoke their new softwood lumber tariffs.
What a wonderful day for Canada, and therefore of course, the world  :)
Sweet.
Priorities
C'mon, what are you thinking! That's our retirement syrup! We've been budgeting our syrup use for the last 15years, like responsible Canadians, in hopes that when we retire and won't have as much syrup that we can maintain our current standard of pancakes.  Punish the savers yet again bailing out those who cannot live within their syrup usage means.
Is this a parody news source like beaverton or the onion?
I’m not usually a nationalist but this news has me wanting us not to export and just keep it all for ourselves.
I thought this had to be satire since it was the same amount of maple syrup as the US is releasing oil but somehow it's not??
Of course they are. Anyone who left Canada to join ISIS should be charged with treason and put in jail forever.
Leaving your country to join a foreign terrorist organization with the goal of theocratic world domination should result in immediate forfeiture of Canadian citizenship. Isis fighters and supporters are among the few people that I wholeheartedly support the death penalty towards.
These people shouldn't be let back in unless it's straight to jail.
She left to join ISIS. Obviously she is a threat.
Let's assume *yes*.
She is ISIS member, of course. What are waiting for? Waiting for her to prove the point with an actual attack in Canada?
People who join terrorists groups and have offshore bank accounts should lose their citizen status. Of course she won’t get deported because hurt feelings or something.
Nobody coming back from joining a terrorist group should be allowed to keep their citizenship and should be kicked out
Who’s paying for that d’ya think?
Peace bond seems like an under response for a person who appears to have admitted committing a terrorism offense. 
Shouldn't it be prosecution and seeking bail conditions instead?
She’s from Calgary? Didn’t Calgary have a large number of people travel and join up with ISIS a few years ago? What the fuck is in the water there?
She's more Canadian than me because she chose to come here
Jail sure if they sneak back, they should remove citizenship and denied entry.
Well that increases the cost of sustaining said prisoners. So instead it would be awesome if these folks automatically loose re-entry rights the very moment they board the plane out of here to join such orgs. Good riddance.
I prefer a targeted bomb strike but jail should work of they return
But our fearless leader decided ‘A Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian’ and you removed the laws that allowed that to happen….
She is a Canadian citizen, she has to be let back in. But agreed, they should be detained if they participated in foreign terrorist acts.
Giving government the ability to strip citizenship from those designated as "enemies of the state" is a power you REALLY don't want to hand out if there's any other way to solve the problem.
If she is a terrorist she isn't Canadian anymore
I agree. I rather not risk giving that power to the government. Instead, let her use her 'right' to enter Canada as a citizen, face a trial, and be put in jail for life for terrorism.
Wow, the fed is telling us that we fucked up. The fed.
"The US Federal Reserve (The Fed) published its Q2 2021 exuberance index recently. The index, considered a “smoking gun” for bubbles, shows Canada is well into a real estate bubble. Researchers say markets that become exuberant will experience a correction in the future. The longer it takes to correct, the larger and more dangerous it becomes."
Oh boy....
I hope I am wrong, but I don't think it's a bubble I don't think it will pop and deflate.
Too many buyers in the market are well funded.
Relative few are actually in danger of losing their houses when interest rates rise.
There will eventually be a dip, a big one, and well funded buyers will swarm in to pick up "deals".
The limit of what a home is worth is it's rate of return from renting. If rents started dropping quickly house prices would too.
I’m in Toronto . I have the cash in the bank to buy a place outright. Someone asked why am I not buying right now ?
Three things . What goes up must come down . I remember the bubble from the late 80’s popping . And never ever get pulled into the hype of buying something because you’re afraid of missing out. I’ll continue renting short term places . No rush
Let me know when it's a real estate balloon.
A bubble on a bubble.
But it's different this time......
Real Estate market is Irrational.
Bought my house in Edmonton, AB ten years ago for $300,000 put money into renovations and it is still worth $300,000 after the relators take their cut. Come on Alberta get onboard with the rest of the country.
Man if I wasn't convinced I'd never own a home before I sure am convinced now.
Its not a bubble. 
The local incomes may not suggest it, but theres too much foreign money in this country. First you have China that uses this country to wash their dirty money, and then you have mass immigration which includes student visas.
Remember people had stories of immigrating to Canada/US with two bucks in their pocket? With globalization, its not the case anymore. You have families coming in with hundreds of thousands of dollars, ready to buy a property with a brand new Mercedes or two.
This puts local buyers at risk, who earn and save proceeds from a highly taxed Canadian salary in a high cost of living environment.
Its not a bubble, its displacement. A game of musical chairs. If you cant afford it, someone from Hong Kong or UAE will take your place, while you have to sleep in a car. 
The prices will remain this way as long as we will keep bringing in people by the boatloads.
The thing people don't think about is the fact that the housing market is being driven by investors, not people buying homes to live in. 
What does this mean? One minor correction can start a domino effect where investors start to panic sell. 
I'm in Windsor Ontario, a lot of Torontonians are buying up properties here and turning them into rentals. However, the people who are moving to Windsor aren't typically renters, meaning the people who are renting are local Windsorites who make Windsor wages. 
These investors expect Windsorites to pay Toronto prices for Windsor and they simply can't. A typical Windsorite cannot afford $1700/month for a 2 bedroom. So what's happening is a lot of these rentals are sitting empty. The place across from me is a 2 bedroom asking $2K/month... in Windsor. Suprisingly it's been on the market for over a month. At some point these investors are going to start releasing they can't get an ROI on their investments and start panicking. 
People keep looking at the GTA as being out of hand and that's what'll cause a crash. I'll argue that it's the small towns/areas outside the GTA that are going to cause the house of cards to fall.
Ooh, a Better Dwelling article. Into the trash it goes
PoP!!!
If only Canada could diversify
It’s not a bubble.
People keep telling me that we arnt in a bubble though. That thos massive price increase nation wide is just natural price movement. Even though it's never happened before. Oh well
Who would have thought that large companies buying huge sums of houses for the passive income and others money laundering would artificially keep the housing expensive
The party that gets left holding this shit bag will be wiped off the map like the PCs
They're not true economists like the Bank of Canada's economists, any criticism of the Bank of Canada is a conspiracy theory.
Don't you threaten me with a good time like that.
The Liberals know they're probably not getting another mandate, so we can expect them to try and maintain it for the current term and then toss that hot potato to whoever wants it.
Ill say it again. Canada needs to a restrict foreign and corporate ownership, as well as limiting the number of homes or land a single person can buy. Canada is gonna go the way of California, but without its hyper Rich sectors.
#Edit: there are over 1.3 million empty homes in canada, thats nearly 9% of Canadas' total homes overall. I bet a lot of these are placeholders for foreign investors who who are willing to wait till someone accepts their hyperinflated home prices.

Our youth are soooo fucked.
How many Xs the GDP should it be? What’s the average of a healthy economy?
Hong Kong migrant to U.S. banks: where can i put $400k
U.S banks: absolutely nowhere
Canadian banks:  do you want cheques with that?
It’s almost like that attached townhouse *isn’t* worth $6 million.
And yet we’ve heard nothing of substance on how this will be fixed from the current government or frankly any other other party. All we’ve heard is policies that allow Canadians to take on more debt, which is not a solution to the problem. 
Nothing about restructuring our economy and reinvesting in actual businesses that produce goods and services instead of a ponzi scheme that produces nothing. Housing is a zero sum game.
Is the TL;DR on this that we are basically a second vacation home for rich foreign nationals?
Housing is how our government makes money they need that foreign investment.
Not sure how they got these numbers but they're off by a lot.
The average price in Canada is $716,585 according to CREA and there are 15 million dwellings.
Residential real estate is actually worth $10.8 trillion, about 4.3x GDP.
Cool story.
Big numbers.
What’s it all mean? What are the real world implications? What does it all mean for the average Canadian homeowner? The article doesn’t really go in depth beyond the I formation in the title.
Canada is a housing bubble. Things will get real ugly if the prices keep going up AND if they somehow start going down. There's no way out of this. Either home owners are going to get rekt or non-home owners are gonna get rekt. There's no 'everyone wins' scenario.

Not good. We need a bubble burst.
A bubble is defined as something that deviates from its intrinsic value so is it really worth that figure?
Do you Remember when you were little. 
...and you learned how to blow bubbles with Gum. 
Do you Remember competing to make the "LARGEST" bubble before popping?
...well, Canada is going to win.
The us has people to sustain it's bubble.
Say it with me.  Real. Estate. Should. Not. Be. An. Investment.
If that ain't a bubble of epic proportions I don't know what is.
Good thing I decided to retire early and move out of here.
No way I can afford to live here anymore.
The staggering nonsense this blog keeps churning!! The GDP is a year's worth of economic activity. The value of RE is the result of 500 years of economic activity. Its analogous to saying "my net worth is 5 times my annual income" - it a claim, but a useless one.
The economist quoted in the article asserts there is no link between money supply increases and inflation.  And they wonder why nobody trusts "experts" anymore.
Trudeau will just say sorry and then tell us why it's our fault and they we can do better, and learn. And then get re elected with the same 32 percent.....
Wash. Cry. Repeat.
He just won an election. He won’t care or do anything for another 3 years.
It’s Justinflation!
He doesn’t care
[removed]
Nah it's just the regular person that's gonna feel it hard. These liberal snakes got enough money to sustain themselves no matter what your inflation sits at
Spending close to $12,000/yr on food in Nanaimo before COVID, as a single person? That guy would have run into trouble even absent the high inflation we’re seeing.
“While the experts say it’s not Ottawa’s fault”
Hahahaha oh right printing 45% of our money supply in 2 years doesn’t cause inflation.
CBC and their “experts.” They really think we are all so dumb and will just lap up whatever “expert” they can find to defend the Liberal agenda.
This is how Canada works:
The Liberals run the government, until the economy tanks -- either it's their fault due to fiscal mismanagement, or sometimes shit just happens.
Then we elect the Conservatives to get some "fiscal responsibility". They are no better (and often worse), so they get booted out at the next election.
Then the Liberals get re-elected and form the next government and the cycle restarts. If the economy recovers, they take full credit, and then go through a series of scandals until they get booted again.
As is tradition.
20 year, CBC?
Sure. But most of it has come from the last two administrations through printing money.
It's not Trudeau's fault but vote him out anyways. NDP NDP NDP NDP NDP NDP
Spike?
Is this blaming them for being in power for 20years or is this actually dumb enough to point at a number that has gone up every year since the beginning of the dollar
He will still keep winning
Until the Cons drop the socon side. And NDP get their head out of the clouds and give some realistic plans and expectations, I can't see this changing things.
it's helping environment : people are  eating less meat. So somehow, Trudeau is filling one of his goal 😁
I remember when the “Experts” said Canadians would come out ahead financially after the carbon tax implementation.
Its insane how many people actually believed or still believe that if you give money to the government they will waive a magic wand and you’ll come out ahead. 
I thought it was satire news but it was 100% real.
I know, like the PM even gives a fuck. It has not affected his trust fund yet.
The "expert" is entirely out of alignment with the majority. This is basic econ 101.
The mass shooting in Nova Scotia triggered Trudeaus assault style gun ban, which of course only applies to legal gun owners. What Trudeau didn't mention was that the shooter had obtained his guns illegally and was in no way legal to have any weapons of any kind, so had the ban been in place before that fateful day, absolutely no difference. It was even reported that  the RCMP had been contacted by people with concerns about the individual before that day.  They did nothing.  
Why would a government make more laws when the current ones are not being enforced you might ask? Optics. Creating the illusion of action being taken. And of course, votes, because there will always be people who will not educate themselves on Canada's current gun laws before applauding a politicians new impotent ones.
Most of people murdered/murdering were gangsta’s and aspiring rap stars.  Better ban a farmer in Peace River from having a rifle.
But but certainly it's not all the handguns illegally smuggled into our country, we need to ban all rifles!!
/s
I wonder what the average sentence is for these violent offenders in Canada vs other parts of the world.
More Sunny Ways from Trudeau.
The gun bans sure are working!
High inflation disstabilize society and inequality cause mental issues.
1991 is still king of the murder years
My one vacation to Toronto in 2019 and there was a gang shootout half a block from my hotel right on the street. Never going back.
Such breaking news, as population rises so do human made problems.
Was there anything unusual about 2020 that might have caused enormous stress and anxiety and financial problems?
I seem to recall something.
When can Canada get it's own 2A? If everyone had the choice to be armed things would be a lot more calm and polite since legal gun owners are the only people punished by gun laws.
While it's not exactly good news, I'd like to point out that our murder rate nationwide is lower than the murder rates of several US cities standing alone.
I think the 'murder' rates would go down if there was a bounty on rat-lickers... Then it would just be "justifiable homicide".
This is where you're wrong, buster.
It's definitely the fault of all those legal gun owners. If only they had 2 locks on the gun for it to be "fully-locked", this tragedy could have been easily prevented.
So good to see people supporting progressive policies. ^^^/s
I am sure you read the article and are struggling with comprehension. Keep trying, you'll get better.
Racially Motivated comment
Tell me you didn’t read the article without telling me you didn’t read the article.
And airsoft too!
No its definitely  the fault of all those legal gun owners. If only they had 2 locks on the gun to be "fully-locked", we can avoid needless gun violence.

So I guess that means they are full fledged Canadians now.
Lol welcome to the party pal
So in other words, no one is happy about this housing situation
Let's be honest. Canada's primary industry has become the storage of humans. 
We have a diminishing resource and extractive sector. Our agricultural exports are down. Through free trade policies, we have allowed our industries to fold or leave. Our services are based on either insurance, takeout or cell phone plans. 
That only leaves governments and storing people. With plans to bring in over 400 000 immigrants each year, storing people is our biggest growth industry.
Surprise immigrants! Our country fucking sucks too!
I was born in Canada and can't afford a home. Wtf is this shit

Only the rich and corrupt are happy. Dividing the issue between another version of ‘us vs them’ just distracts from the message that the one percent need to be taken down.  Every kind of Canadian should be focus their energy into stopping the pigs in control from lowering our quality of life.
Being taken advantage of by the government? Lied to in order to subsidize the continued existence of money laundering avenues for international criminals and millionaires? Having serious doubts about the viability of your future in this country?
Sounds like true integration. Welcome to Canada.
I am a relatively recent immigrant to our country. Moved in Late 2018. The country mostly rocks in every way except for housing. What’s really infuriating is that the situation looks to have been a result of short-sighted selfish greed and not any physical limitations. I can understand that telecom is expensive. Large country with small population. But it makes no sense that housing is this expensive when you look at the amount of land, lumber, other materials and hell access to labor from around the world that we have.
Hmm so you’re telling me, allowing a market to grow around one of the most basic needs allowed companies and predators to take advantage of said system? 
Wow who would have guessed. 
Everyone needs housing/shelter. It’s a human right we should be able to offer to anyone and everyone. Look at how much space we have! 
We need public housing, those public houses need to be like 10% of income to live in instead of the 50% plus it’s costing most people. We need public transport so that the other 50% isn’t used on a vehicle that you don’t need besides for work. We need space to grow our gardens, energy that doesn’t poison our children. The list of things we need is miles long.  We know the solution, how come we don’t do anything? 
Why are other countries able to implement these sweeping changes? What is stopping us? 
We should, can, and have a duty to do things that will improve the next generations lives. I pray we can do something soon.
I do ridesharing and many new immigrants tell me the government paints a very rosy picture of the country in their immigration to Canada process.
A family I spoke to from the UAE had no idea there would be a fierce competition for the home they rented. They had to cough up a years rent in advance to the landlord, who also bought the property via UAE. 
Trudeaus post national state. Your QOL is only better if you leave the country while holding on to a few assets.
People born in Canada aren't happy either so get in line.

Us old immigrants aren't happy either.
I'm an old immigrant and I'm also unhappy with housing
Waaaaa.... where's our free houses you promised us....😪😪😪😪😪
Except Vancouver.
We are expecting a 15c jump in prices at the pump.
Great now i can get my ETH out before Christmas
So it will drop on Sunday and then rise twice as much on Wednesday.
I sincerely hope this is true
Article Highlights:
* Dan McTeague, president of Canadians for Affordable Energy, said prices will drop by either 10 or 11 cents by Sunday depending on a province’s tax system.
* “This is right across the country, with the exception of the Maritime provinces — Atlantic Canada — which have a regulated system, so they may have to wait unfortunately until next week,” he told Global News. McTeague said provinces with an HST system will see a net drop of 11 cents per litre at the pumps come Sunday. He said Quebec will also see a 11-cent drop.
* Provinces with GST will see a drop of 10 cents per litre, he said.
* But McTeague says he doesn’t expect the drop in gas prices to last.
* “There is a strong sense, and I would agree with that, that it’s overdone and when U.S. American energy traders get back to work Monday morning after their long weekend, we may very well see the prices move back up as early as Wednesday,” he said.  “So take advantage of this.”
* In the Greater Toronto Area, the average price is expected to drop to 134.9 per litre, which McTeague said hasn’t been seen in the region since Aug. 25.
That’s not enough
Why does 'most of Canada' never include Vancouver?
We kinda gotta lay in our buttered bread. We make decisions based on Facebook then get freaked out when we look at our income vs what we’re paying out . 
Country covered in oil but now it’s back to Venezuela for Canada.
Not BC surely.
I was literally pumping gas into my car this eve when the attendant walks out of the station and changes the display price with a remote... went down 2c. I would have saved 60c.  Doh!
Last month's headline: expect gas prices to rise: experts. 
(always right)
Today's heading: expect gas prices to drop: analyst.
(always wrong)
This would be a great time for Dougy to claim that he is finally bringing in his -10 cent gas election promise.
I usually gauge gas prices by which eyebrows Trudeau pasted on that day.
And the weekend's almost gone and the prices remained the same
Are the Liberals announcing a snap Federal Election?   ... /s
Don't people know with JT carbon pricing that the gas will be $2 by 2030
Just checked gas buddy and some states are at 0.80 cents per liter equivalent. Thanks Trudeau.
I suppose this is one of those reep what you sow moments.
I was on alienwares website to see what they were charging for 12th gen intel computers and I saw that you can’t legally get a high end graphics card in BC because they use too much electricity.
You have my sympathy.
I'm not going to work until they sort this out.

Announced literally at the same time [as the US. ](https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/26/politics/travel-restrictions-south-africa/index.html) At least there seems to be coordination.
Anyone know why we are not limiting travel from Malawi while the US, UK, and EU are? Is this article just incorrect?
This must be serious.   I know this because we're skipping the usual lectures about racism and xenophobia before enacting this.
They have named it Omicron, are we now in a Transformers movie?
Props to the feds for getting this right, learning from previous mistakes is always a good sign with a government
If this variant is as serious as they say, one would assume the Olympics will be cancelled shortly, right?
Glad to know they don’t think it’s racist to do that anymore, even if it only *slows* the inevitable transmission into our borders rather than *stops* it.
I really hope this doesn't fuck up the US Canadian border again. In about 2-3 weeks I need to go pick up all my black Friday shopping I have shipped to the border...
Are there travel restrictions to Asia, Europe, and the Middle East since there are cases there too? Specifically HongKong, Turkey, Israel, and Belgium identified with cases.
Edit: here is a map of the confirmed cases: [https://newsnodes.com/nu\_tracker](https://newsnodes.com/nu_tracker)
How does this affect the port in Durban, South Africa? Its one of the largest in the region. Will they be restricting that too?
What do you know. You *can* ban travel from South African countries after all.
No cries about racism and xenophobia? Oh right, Trump is out of the picture now so people can stop pretending to be outraged about what is an obviously correct move.
Should be shut down to more than just southern africa.  Going to be too little too late again.
even the US enacted restrictions, internally they must be looking at truly insane numbers to force them to do this so quickly
All theatre if all travel isn't banned.
Why are we doing this now?

Fun Fact: Omicron is an anagram for Moronic.
Didn't Hong Kong already detect someone with Omincron on a flight from Vancouver?
Two planes from South Africa landed in the Netherlands and 10% of the 600 passengers had covid. Those people have been quarantined at a hotel. The rest were allowed to quarantine at home or carry on to their destinations.
Now let me understand this. Ten percent of the passengers had covid, likely the new more contagious version. The testing does not detect antibodies in people who have recently become infected. What are the odds some of those people on the flights have become infected by those 10%? Pretty high. Yet they just send them on their way to their next destinations! I wonder how many are headed here.
Lrrr up to his old tricks
Omicron sounds so fucking scary, like the leader of the Decepticons is here personally.
Autobots, roll out!
I swear to fuck if we have to postpone our wedding for the fourth time…
Who the fuck even cares?
This is getting old. Who cares. Let’s move on.

That was fast. 
It’s like the scene in Scream.

Be afraid. Be very afraid.
Two more weeks!
Pretty sure it is here already. Canadians travelling to other countries have already been found with it.
Oh fuk
The left really needs to choose either mass migration or climate change goals because you cannot have both if you are importing millions of people from low carbon countries to high carbon Canada.
Heating a canadian home for one winter releases more co2 than an Indian will release in an entire year
Nature doesn't care if our species lives or not.
That's racist /s
They should increase the tax rate for secondary properties in BC to pay for this.
"*This is far from the first time the Green Lantern star has shown his philanthropic side to Canadian causes.*"
Green Lantern star? Surely there's another, more successfully franchise that could have been used to describe the guy.
Ryan Reynolds is a great Canadian, period!
He could toss in a few million but he'd rather us plebs pay for it.
What has he had to do with Vancouver lately?
He’s not even a good ambassador for Canada let alone Vancouver.
You're right. It should be "_X-Men Origins: Wolverine_ star".
He encouraged others to make donations and he and Blake made a donation.  They didn't tell us how much they donated and it's really none of our business, but they did donate.
They donate to charitable causes all over Canada.  When COVID lockdowns first hit and food banks were having a hard time keeping up with demand, they donated several hundred thousand dollars to help out.
I know they've done more for Canadians and especially people in BC than I have.  I wouldn't dream of making an asshole of myself by trying to suggest they don't do enough.
Honestly.... I mean he does donate money but he could do a lot more individually than what thousands of people could collectively.
He literally gave a million dollars
You mean The Outer Limits star (he was in 3 episodes it counts).
LOL
Or, idk.... Deadpool star?? It is the franchise the man is most famous for.
Edit: apparently you haven't watched a lot of movies.
So could our government.
Or the government which he pays more taxes to than any of us lmao. Y'all are never happy. Someone rich donates, fuck 'em. Someone rich doesn't donate, fuck 'em
Apparently you don’t understand sarcasm.
Oh I do dear, when it's done right.
That's a bad bad headline. Its not a demand for EVs that's the problem. It's the blatantly protectionist and biased subsidy the U.S. wants. 
The government needs to make a big noise about this crap.
As someone who works in consulting side and heavily on trade.  Biden is worse for Canadian exports to the USA then Trump.
And Trump was bad.
No one likes to talk about that though.
Canada's two biggest exports.  Oil and cars, followed by car parts.  Biden is killing both when it comes to the USA.
As someone from Ontario (who has family working in automotive manufacturing), people in Ontario are going to quickly learn how our friends in Alberta feel.
Well it’s about time we start doing our own thing instead of sitting at the table going hey feed me too.  If the US is going to serve itself we need to get off our asses and start engineering, building and producing
Enough of being second fiddle to the US.
I know it’s a lot easier said than done. We just can’t sit around anymore when everyone else seems to be in it for themselves as well.
Well, Canada killed off every other industry.  The remainder is just following suit.  Pretty soon all we will 'provide' is 'human resources' and 'services'.   Might as well close down our oil production as well.
We should know by now that America has never signed a treaty - for trade or otherwise - that they weren't willing to break at the first opportunity.
Not sure why is not getting more attention.
The loss of this sector or a major downgrade, IMO could be the nail in the coffin of Ontario - where the provincial government ends up insolvent.
I see this potentially being Ontario's "Muskrat Falls moment" (the final nail in NL fiscal coffin).
Unlike in 2008/2009 - displaced workers won't be able to run to AB to work in O&G.
Obviously an insolvency just becomes more likely if the housing bubble bursts. (multiple economic  threats on the horizon).
There is no real safety to be smug here either, bc if Ontario ends up insolvent it will hurt all of Canada, as the province is certainly "too big to fail".
We could get a return to serious industrial policy but instead  the government will likely focus on continuing to shift the economy to unproductive real estate.
I think we need to help retrain these displaced workers into other industries because it's clear this is the future and they've known change was coming for a long time. 
Or at least that's what the rest of Canada has been saying about AB's oil and gas industry lately.
No big deal. Ontario can surely just diversify.
Canada has done a aweful job of readying our economy to modernize
Turns out relying on the housing bubble is a bad play
Canadian-based maker of electric cars. Make it happen, Ottawa.
Oh, don't want to do that? Have fun when the industry gets wrecked and suddenly the government is dropped by a sudden rise in unemployment.
Its expensive. It's tricky. It's also becoming ever more necessary. So get on it.
People need to stop thinking that the Americans are our friends. They really aren’t, you know. Countries don’t have friends. The Americans will protect us because they don’t want hostile powers getting closer to them in North America, not because they care about us. They will invest here as long as it’s profitable, and will do trade agreements with us when they think that that benefits them. But in any matter or in any way when they can see an advantage in screwing us over they will do it without a second thought.
They literally could not care less what happens to this country. Or any country. They are not friends. You care about what happens to your friends and are willing to put yourself out and inconvenience yourself and do a lot of things to help them just because you care about them. Countries do not care about each other. Canadians need to grow up and understand that.
If we had a government which would focus on economic development and expansion instead of constantly working on simply redistribution what money is still here, and borrowing more to make up for the lack, maybe this kind of thing wouldn’t matter much as it’s going to. Our industries are grossly inefficient because we rely on cheap labor from immigration and temporary foreign workers and our companies have never bothered to do anything else to increase productivity.
Canada’s productivity is constantly lagging our Western allies and especially the United States because business doesn’t bother to invest in new equipment or training. Not to mention we have a government which keeps throwing more red tape and bureaucracy in their way and is doing its best to strangle the natural resources industries which have been the biggest money earners for this country over the last century while replacing them with fantasies about us leading the world in green energy. And if that's not enough they promise to implement ever greater carbon taxes on industry, which will simply drive more of them south. You notice Biden talks a big game but there's still no carbon tax down south, and there isn't going to be one.
Adapt or die, if a new industry is making a huge impact and you don't change your business model to include it, that's 100% your fault.  EV's are great, Ford is making really decent ones, there's start ups that look like they will actually be producing as well (so less vaporware companies than before cough Nikola cough), shits gonna change yo.
Have they tried selling their parts overseas?  Maybe it is time for Ontario to diversify.
Manufacturing is a carbon intensive industry and has no place in a modern Canada /s
Now Ontario can feel how it feels to be fucked by the federal govt. you reap what you sow
Time for the federal government to ask Ontario and Quebec to shut off the switches until the US backs the fuck off this protectionist shit, if that's not enough leverage then we're pretty much fucked because our federal government has spent the last 6 years undermining every other export industry that could give us leverage.
I'm really not seeing a lot of winning moves here for us, maybe central Canada is going to lose it's automotive industry.
Can't we just stop sending water and electricity to the US? Pretty obvious they are not really watching out for us like we do for them.
Doesn’t Canada have the worlds largest supply of untapped graphene? I’d say we’re primed to created the batteries that will power all the EVs, computers and everything else the US needs to green themselves. 
We need to build out manufacturing here instead of shipping it out of country after it’s mined and processed.
Lol. No. Trudeau isn't to blame. He's just making it worse
It’s happening in just about every country in the world, due to pandemic related manufacturing and supply chain constraints. There is absolutely nothing any political leader in Canada (or any other country) could have done to make it worse (or better).
Perhaps not. But how the Country recovers will be up to Trudeau, some Countries will recover faster than others based on government policies. Given the Liberals don’t seem very inclined on tackling inflation, I would guess we will not recover as quickly as other Countries.
Canadian’s should also remember inflation, cost of living, housing and debt were all issues in Canada pre-pandemic under Trudeau. These were issues already. So not everything can be waved away as “well Covid”. 
With our economy not being very diverse and poor monetary policies pre-pandemic Canada was not in a good position when Covid hit. Our debt to GDP is also much higher than other Countries. All of which was under Trudeau’s leadership.
I would also call BS on Canada sitting near 5% inflation, given cost of living, housing, food, utilities, Canada must be at least 10-20% inflation. Which would mean, yes inflation is happening around the World but Canada’s inflation is much higher. Which could be blamed on Trudeau.
It's a global issue, but polievre is just looking for sound bites for twitter, he interrupts, says something, his back benchers cheer, he records that sound bite.
I am outside Canada at the moment and inflation is much worse in other countries than it is in Canada. For the Conservatives to put all the blame on Trudeau shows just how out of touch they are with what is a global situation right now. Then factor in 
the  financial crisis in China on top of supply chain issues . It’s like the perfect storm having ripple effects around the world. 
ripple effects worldwide.
Blaming Trudeau is the Conservative party chant. They don't have much else. Trudeau takes up a ton of head space in these people. Sad really. 
Reality is a nasty pandemic hit the world. Trudeau asked his econimic ministers and the BoC to try and mitigate economic disaster by various means. One could say the fact inflation is only this high and not significantly higher is due to the actions they took.
Does a Conservative understand how high inflation gets when your economy crashes?
Trudeau is to blame for many things, but inflation is just a natural consequence of Capitalism.
He's only to blame in so far as he refuses to put in place a better system, which goes for all our politicians.
If politicians could cause inflation, they could also cancel inflation.
Since they can't cancel inflation, odds are that they are not causing it either.
Pretty much this. The feds didn't start the fire, they just poured gasoline on it, and used a billow to spread it to nearby houses, then set up road blocks to prevent the fire department from getting near. Then they declared victory because they kept people warm.
The manufacturing and supply chain constraints are because of government orders to shut down nearly the entire ecocnomy, there is lots that could have been done for better or worse
Yet they raise interest rates and taxes to control spending. Controlling spending has an effect on infation.
Most countries are not as resource rich with such a small population. If canadians got their fair share no one would be struggling.
[removed]
Why not make it 50% while you're at it
The virus is also a global issue.  But you'll notice the countries that put an effort to control the virus are doing better than the ones that don't.
The Statcan numbers have some pretty obvious flaws in them which have driven underreported inflation. So if you're not in Canada and are just looking at the statistics it's entirely possible that you're just looking at measurement error.
Please can you explain how inflation is worse in other countries? Did housing prices increase by more than 10% in other countries or more than 20% in other cities in 2020?
Trudeau isn't (entirely) to blame, but once the match was lit, he and Freeland poured gasoline on it.
It's not, one the PM is printing money like crazy and that does drive up inflation by giving less value on CAD$ . That's basic economics. The PM says he cares, but he's to busy caring about dress codes in house of commons, helping the Big Three screw over Canadians with the new Bi C-10, allows dairy industry, which is a protected monopoly drive up the cost of food when it's not needed and they are citing the global prices as a reason.
Scandinavian countries with their controlled spending and small debt aren't suffering much.

Wtf Bryan stop licking doorknobs
Can someone explain how we know this isn’t just testing positive from the first infection mere weeks earlier? Aren’t residual positive tests a thing?
This makes no sense, you're not supposed to get re-tested for several months once you test positive as you're likely to keep getting positive results.
But how sick did he get? That's all that matters.
It seems like ages ago that people were ridiculously trying to cancel him because of his ill-advised "Thanks, China" comments after he had to cancel a tour at the beginning of the pandemic.
Can't stop this thing covid started!
This guy must have a terrible immune system
damn I didn't know he was anti vax 🤮🤮🤮
Vegans are known for their weak immune systems.
Is he going to blame it on the Asians again?
[removed]
I think that’s what it is.  He’s one of those that’ll keep testing positive months after.
They said 3 months after my gf tested positive. She was a false positive, but was still counted as a real positive in the system.
he was "sitting in an ambulance" so im guessing it caught it again and have symptoms
Being contagious would matter more.
Funny because he was asymptomatic both times. So maybe actually a strong immune system?

Put him in the old folks home with Don Cherry and Rex Murphy.
I take any my dad says with a grain of salt but am inclined to believe his story of being in one of Suzuki's classes back in the 70s. Apparently my dad was an adult student working full time and so would record his classes so that he could review them later if he was tired from work and didnt follow it all. 
Suzuki would apparently wander the class seeing if he could spot recorders, which was common enough even then that several students would likely have one. He wanted to be sure no one recorded him because "his lectures weren't meant to be distributed later for profit" or something along those lines which is fair enough I guess, except that according to my dad he mostly just talked about whatever cause he was championing that week instead of whatever course and subjecthe was supposed to be teaching based on his syllabus. 
My dad to this day is certain the guy wanted to be sure it wouldn't get back to the university that he wasn't teaching what he was paid for and after watching Suzuki on tv for nearly 40 years I think this is the most likely reason, guy is passionate about these things but has always had an air of arrogance about him even if I agree with a lot of what he has to say about the environment and changes we need to make.
At 85 Suzucki should just shut up and retire from public life
Some people get old and get a bit deranged. Some people have always been a bit deranged. While David Suzuki is a smart man, he is indeed a person belonging to both of the above categories.
Is that a WE charity mic?
Some people’s words are given greater weight due to celebrity culture.
Usually the craziest ones are the loudest.
He should have been put out to permanently pasture long ago.
Didn't this mentally deranged lunatic say something about blowing up pipelines recently?
Piece of shit
His degree is in fruit fly's.
He’s like Canada’s grandpa… His hearts in the right place but sometimes he says things that are clunkers.
Yeah leave it to nat post to write something like this. Move the fuck on boomers.
When a single aging man known for his environmental vigor makes some questionable statements it can be embarrassing, but we will all be there one day. Even if I don't agree with a lot of what Suzuki says, he's entitled to his opinion,we don't build policy around David's rants... Now let's talk postmedia, should we talk about the amount of bullshit opinion pieces they spew on a weekly basis under the loose term of journalism or maybe the hypocrysy that it's american owned but like to hide the fact behind the postmedia brand.
Q’elle surprise that simple, greedy folks hate him. The neanderthals hate the inconvenient truths and their messengers.
[removed]
anyone over 70 should be ignored.
David Suzuki is actually insane though. He has mental problems.
My dad also had a class at UBC by Suzuki. Says he was a mean and vindictive prof. Took pleasure in failing people and having one of the highest failure rates of any science class. 
My dad passed, if that matters (not just bitter).
Seems to be.

Most spammers spoof numbers, so how will that work?
Can’t get spam calls if you don’t pick up calls you don’t recognize 😉
My favourite spam calls are the ones in a language that I don't understand. I have no idea WTF they are trying to hawk to me. 😃
This does not work at all.  Ive been receiving phonecalls from the same number for over 4 years now.  Theyve been blocked but are still able to leave me voicemail daily.  Ive submitted countless complaints to this as well as my service provider.
Maybe its time to reinstate the death penalty
I could do that and it goes nowhere. But I could also torment the scammers and waste their time over the phone ensuring that each minute they spend with me is not a minute they are using to scam elderly immigrants, and ensuring that each time they hear loud gay porn being played in the background their soul dies inside just a little more.
Both Bell and Rogers own the voice/cell network and they decided to do nothing since it doesn't bring any money to the table for them and would just cost them money.
 If anything it makes them money since people are using data/voice for this garbage.
garbage companies
Robocalls & Spam Calls are extremely annoying & for people who succumb to their lies, it's robbery. Please make sure to go online or phone the CRTC to report these crooks. If everyone did that, then more funding and personnel might go towards fighting this crime, or at least to lower the number of stinking, rotten annoyance calls. Before CBC's Marketplace did a well researched documentary on spam calls, the RCMP wasn't doing anything to combat  these crooks.  Now they are. Use this link: https://www.fightspam.gc.ca/eic/site/030.nsf/frm-eng/MMCN-9EZV6S
Well, 6 years ago they did fine the 7 people in the GTA who hired the Islamabad call centre to make "Air Duct Cleaning Services" calls.
A few thousand bucks each. Didn't stop them did it now.
Here's the [news article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/duct-cleaning-companies-pay-55-000-for-violating-do-not-call-list-1.3007159).

There's supposed to be an end to number spoofing at the end of this month. 
I doubt it'll actually happen though.
Email was exactly the same.  It worked like letter mail - you could write anything on the From field.
Until the advent of SPF, DMARC, DKIM, whatever new technologies they layered on top of email, there was *no mechanism whatsoever* to check if the email came from a computer in any way associated to the "from" address on the email.  The destination just trusted it and displayed whatever the address was.
Caller ID is the same.  There's no mechanism to prove a call came from a certain number, because phone numbers basically aren't even real anymore.
Even now, those new technologies designed to block spam email are implemented pretty inconsistently and don't really do everything they were expected to.  A lot of companies set them up ("do not accept mail from anyone except Server ABC") and then forget and change their email infrastructure.  As a destination company, what do you do?  Follow their instructions and delete every legitimate email they send you?
The same thing will happen with phone calls.  How can Canada actually impose some sort of identity system that noone else on Earth uses?
It won't. I've been getting at least one "Canada Border Services" call a day, and they're from everywhere from Langley to Omaha. The problem is a technical one.
This link is only for email spam. This page directs phone call spam to the National Do Not Call list. Which as we all know, does nothing.
I literally get that call every week.
Every time I tell them I live in an apartment, or have radiators, or I'm homeless, or whatever.  Gotta be 20 times now.  They don't care; they literally do not have a mechanism to remove numbers.
If only every single human being in BC over the age of 10 had a cellular device capable of receiving messages.
If only there was some sort of messaging system to alert every single human being in the province of what is coming and what they should look to do, or where they could read up on more details.
If only the “this is only a test” emergency broadcast text system could be somehow adapted to send messages that aren’t tests.
Edit: to answer some other responses.
“Hey this is the first red alert we’ve ever issued, tee-hee! I sure hope everyone happens to check their weather app!”
No. You don’t leave these things to chance. If it’s truly a “red alert”, you don’t run any risk of having to say afterward, “well gosh darn it, we just figured everyone is always watching the news and everyone always has our specific weather app”.
There’s an “emergency alert system”. Use that system when there is an emergency to send an alert. 
What, can they not afford the texting fees?
Are they worried about sending out too many alerts? “Wow, I can’t believe they bothered me about this ‘RED ALERT!’ They made me glance at my phone one more time than I usually do!”
"Sir, the clouds are raising shields and arming weapons!"
A red alert the first time would’ve been nice
This is fine
Mother Nature, could you chill the fuck out for a minute?
But won't somebody think of the oil  industry?
I have a widget on my phone that shows the current temperature/weather every time I unlock the screen.  And if I tap on it, it shows me the forecast for the next 7 days.  And if I tap on the "more" button at the bottom, it takes me to the Weather Channel 14 day forecast.
So I already have a cellular device that is not only capable of telling me these things, I have it set up to tell me these things whether the province blares the emergency alert signal or not.
I don't know why people keep bitching that the province isn't dragging them out of their state of oblivious indifference to the world around them to warn them that it's still raining.  Because...you know...it's hard to tell it's raining for all the rain.
I live in Vanderhoof they got that active shooter message out pretty damn fast. No excuses.
Absolutely asinine BC didn’t do this previously. Forget Farnworth’s answer brushing off questions saying it’s the municipal government’s responsibility. Talk about passing the buck. Maybe have another look at your policy Mike.
>If only the “this is only a test” emergency broadcast text system could be somehow adapted to send messages that aren’t tests.
I'm from the UK and I've been in Calgary for a month. Never before had my phone made *that* type of noise when the emergency text thing was conducted as a test. God knows what will have to happen to trigger a real one.
You mean the broadcast system that has only one level that has been over used to the point people literally ignore it most of the time?
Or make any attempt they can to ensure it will not disturb them?
If only there was multiple levels and the Canadian government didn't play boy who cried wolf.
Doh. It's winter storm time. I wunder ifn I should waste muh time and look at the weather report on this new fangled phone thing in my pocket. Nope far to much bother.
I mean- what does a red alert mean?
I have no idea what to do so I’m just sitting on my couch watching Tv.
Environment Canada app/widget will also push warnings and special weather statements for your specific area. It's great.
The point of the emergency system is explicitly to warn people that are not paying attention. When a situation far outside of normal threatens people, it is good to have something to jolt people out of their day to day reality.
It's the same reason we have tsunami warnings, even though all of this information is publicly available right on an app... and people living in tsunami zones should really be smart enough to keep an eye on these things...  the vast majority of people are not checking tsunami warnings by the minute.
I’m glad to hear it. After what happened in the Maritimes last year (can’t remember the province), if someone didn’t use it here again, there would be absolute hell to pay
> has been over used to the point people literally ignore it most of the time?
It was used for the fist time, ever (in BC) [yesterday](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/emergency-text-alert-system-alert-ready-bc-vanderhoof-active-shooter-1.6263281) to warn of an active shooter situation.
At the current juncture, this is the most prudent course of action. Await further instructions from your local overlords.
Nova Scotia
In VANDERHOOF of all places!
At this point I'm surprised they still keep track on it. Nobody seems to care.
I hope Canada is happy. After all, they did vote for this.
Did she remind them that the budget will balance itself, the economy will grow from the heart out, the she-cession will become a she-covery, and that her boss doesn't think about monetary policy?
It is worth remembering that the Conservative government under Stephen Harper brought Canada through the recession by going into deficit spending and then over the course of the next 6 budgets, slowly returned Canada to a surplus.    
When is the Trudeau government expected to return to surplus?
She is meeting with private economist which might means those on her payroll screwed up.

Brrrrrr
Complicit debt-trap diplomacy.
Just tax us in the middle more, it's what they're gonna do anyway.
I said Mr T overspent a few billions of tax dollars before morning coffee was not too far off.
I feel like the 8.5 years I spent in the Army serving Canada was a waste given that our current government was going to do so much harm to our country by bankruptcing our country to protect its population of weaklings who can't kit up and go to work.
The budget will balance itself
Why is the minister meeting with economists? Is it possible that her team just dosen't know what to do and is looking for ideas? 
Im not an economist, but you can google the answer for: 
'how to get myself out of debt.' The first results tend to be something along the lines of, stop overspending.
Wait, our fed deficit is 150B? Holy shit, why bother with a budget, just burn the books and etransfer everyone 5k and call it a day.
And the budget will balance itself
[removed]
What does it mean she will meet with economist.
If I am 500k in debt and meet with an economist how does that help me reduce my debt.
Unless if they are trying to find a way to introduce more taxes.

Is this similar to the RCMP works for the Ministry of Public Safety?  That doesn't seem to be working very well.  Where is the Nova Scotia shooting report from the RCMP?
Edit: plural work to works
Well, I'm not seeing any additional money in the budget from this government to fix the other problems in the military, low staffing, budgets getting eaten up by boondoggles, lack of combat readiness and capability, outdated technology, a lack of respect from the general public (poor PR), the list goes on.
Aren't they way overloaded with officers?
They serve Her Majesty.
Based solely on the article presented here, it sounds like  Gen. Wayne Eyre is responding to an argument that was not, in fact, presented and is using the most highly charged phrasing he can think of.
Can someone remind elected civilians they also work for the people while we're at it? Let's get two birds stoned with this one.
Shaming Canadian military on the reg
Well that sounds not good.
I suspect they knew already.
They answer to the queen, and absent her, the GG. NOT elected assholes.
Democracies don't let militaries be in charge of themselves. Do you need an explanation for why? Or do you just want to talk about the rcmp in a story that has fuck all to do with them?
Nobody cares about the CAF
Anything expensive is kicked down the road. By any government. Military, health care, infrastructure. During elections, many promises are made, but once in office…onto the next government
You just said that we need to give the military more money to fix the money they wasted on boondoggles.
I generally don't reward fuck ups.
Yep, like everything in our public service top heavy and only getting worse.

That South Park episode starting to be more accurate
Is anyone for real believing that border restrictions are going to work here? Fortress Australia is having to abandon them because despite its best efforts it could not keep out delta. NZ had to abandon CovidZero because it too could not keep it out.
And now we have an even more infectious variant while also having the longest land border in the world which has to have commercial traffic go through it so the country can operate? 
Yeah, no. The variant \*is\* coming...the best thing we can do is try to get ahead of it. That would be working with other countries to fast track an updated vaccine and get it out to people ASAP.
Oh my god... who the fuck cares about Covid anymore lmao. Jesus christ people, stop feeding into the fear mongering so badly. Yes, there is a severity to COVID, but my god can we just go about living our lives again? This is getting rediculous, and the governments need to stop overstepping their boundaries.
Well good thing I just came back from a nice vacation to Mexico before they go on a fucking lockdown again.
Can a doctor explain this new variant in medical terms?
Given how often and seemingly easily Covid mutates it's spike proteins in particular are there any vaccines being developed that target something other than the spike proteins? Maybe something less likely to mutate.
Santa is coming to town with a new COVID variant.
Viruses mutate all the time. Stop scaring people.
I hope all the gobs of cash that the pharma companies have been making has been put to use trying to further reduce new vaccine turnaround times.
Fucking absurd. In less than 24 hours the media and government can cause such mass hysteria. 
I implore people, please stop consuming corporate media. Corporate media is the enemy of the people. 
Don’t feed into the click bait bullshit that drives mass clicks among corp news sites.
too late
It's political posturing from Ford but it's still the prudent move. It won't stop it from coming, but it will buy us time to see how virulent it really is and how effective the current vaccines and therapeutic treatments are.
As someone with family in the US… I am so tired. Please don’t close our borders again or enforce quarantine. We already need to be fully vaccinated and tested. I can’t do this anymore.
Article Highlights:
* Premier Doug Ford has called on the federal government to ban all flights and passengers from countries that might bring the new COVID-19 variant into Canada.
* “I was just briefed by Dr. Kieran Moore, Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, about the new variant that’s been found in several countries in Africa that early reports suggest could be vaccine resistant,” Ford said in a statement Friday. “I have contacted the federal government to express my extreme concern about the risks it poses and the need for immediate action today.
* “We cannot repeat the same mistakes that allowed the Alpha and Delta variants to enter our country. Our best defence right now is stopping this variant at the border,” he said.
* The variant — B.1.1.529 — was first detected in an arrival to Hong Kong from South Africa but is now believed to be in a few other countries.
* Some governments have already ordered a ban on flights from South Africa.
\----------------------------------------------------**UPDATE:-------------------------------------------------**
**Canada will be banning the entry of all foreign nationals who have traveled through southern Africa in the last 14 days as concerns over a new coronavirus variant grow.**
Speaking at a press conference on Friday, Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said individuals who have traveled through southern Africa in the last 14 days and are currently in Canada are being asked to quarantine now and to go for a COVID-19 test.
The countries include South Africa, Mozambique, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho and Eswatini. [source](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/canada-bans-travellers-from-southern-africa-as-concerns-mount-over-coronavirus-variant-1.5682764)
\--------------------------
For a wider perspective, here is the  [latest reporting](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/new-covid-variant-south-africa-11-26-21/index.html) from CNN on the new mutation, including other the countries currently imposing travel restrictions.
Ford said it so immediately Trudeau will do the opposite and the people en masse (at least in R/Ontario) will flame Ford for even suggesting it.
He's not wrong.
What an absolutely asinine idea. We've seen that partial bans do nothing. If you really want it keep it out, you have to seal the border.
WHO literally said countries should not do this because it causes more harm and has no effect
They did 🤗

I’m very curious what future generations will say about this whole thing years from now.
I’ma leave it at that…
Don Lemon - Canada is now injecting themselves with horse vaccines.
In my day, they tested on animals *before* humans.
Meanwhile in southern Africa.....
You better be vaccinating my boy, Charles! 
Dude's a living legend and he's fucked more gorilla pussy than Mick Jagger and Keith Richards combined.
With all the talk about following science and being logic how is vaccinated animals at the zoo logical or fact based. So stupid
When will they be rounding up wild antivaxxer bears? I've seen wild unmasked moose as well.
Funny how we tested it out on ourselves before these animals
The Gorilla is not wearing a mask cancel him
If animals don't get a choice, people shouldn't either.
Thank God! I was beginning to feel bad for that one guy named Justin whose job it was to mask the gorillas...it's OK Justin he's just getting used to you
They'll probably be wondering when they can get back to normal.
They'll wonder if the animals had any comorbidities
In my day, the old protected the young. Seems the young must protect the old now. Oh Canada
I kinda hope they haven't fucked any gorilla pussy tbh.
Shh, the science is settled. No questions!

2 more weeks to flatten the curve!
Lmao please don’t say that 😅
Where’s Quebec? Aren’t they going to pony up?
Good. Individuals would find it nearly impossible to get any traction on forcing the government to protect their jobs or ensure they're compensated fairly, but a national union might have the leverage necessary.
Considering that warehouse workers for retail (including/especially online retail) are the ones who account for the vast majority of labour in order for the business to make money, it makes sense that they should earn a reasonable income.
If executives and shareholders are earning profit sharing bonuses/dividends while the workers who actually earn the money are getting dirt wages and poor conditions, something needs to change.  If unions can bring about that change, I'm all for it.
Good. More unions, more union members.
Solidarity ✊
Solidarity forever, for the union makes us strong.
See? JT was right a few months back - the inflation rates were only transitory. Now they are worse so they transitioned indeed.
Unions are absolutely the worst thing that can ever happen to a capitalist.
Great for workers and humanity tho.
Loblaws owns their warehouse union
What’s ridiculous is that as the cost of living increase I’ve seen a lot of wealthier Canadians who have $1 million or far higher move their money abroad to get away from Canada. It’s as usual the people at the bottom that will suffer the most because costs rise and very few industries are catching up to inflation immediately. Many are trying to offset it until it’s legally obligated to raise the wage.￼￼￼
We need unions because without them we are all stuck at minimum wage. The wealthiest corporations should not be allowed to pay minimum wage, minimum wage should be for struggling small businesses.
The answer to escaping this inflation is buy Bitcoin, do some real research.
/r/antiwork
I worked in a Loblaws store during high school. I made minimum wage but actually took home less than that because I had to pay union dues. What a great deal!
These union people are simply kicking their own exploitation game (dues collection racket) into high gear while they still can. 
Warehouse jobs will almost exclusively done by robots before we know it.   If I were working in a warehouse I'd be working now to get ahead of my peers (future competitors you will need to beat out for the resulting fewer jobs there will be) by spending my time learning how to fix or program robots instead of paying good money to join a union that won't have any leverage (and therefore no power) sooner rather than later.
Union bosses become more wealthy but union workers can be poor.
Depends... If you're a capitalist who aspires to being ethical and a good employer, I would argue that a union actually *simplifies* your employment issues. You negotiate a contract with the union, the workers abide by the contract, you abide by it, everybody's happy.  A few years later, you renegotiate.  If you're not a complete piece of crap and employees are generally happy about working for you, the negotiations will probably go well.  Done, and done.
The problem is, that there's a distinct shortage of ethical capitalists.
UFCW is useless.
diamond hands brozzer.
The Loblaws union used to be amazing. Defined benefit pension, healthcare for life, extremely competitive wages... now they do nothing. Only boomers got to reap those benefits.
Right. Union is not always a great solution.
Somewhere right now, there's an officer telling a pack of material techs and vehicle techs to cobble 10 different Leopards into one working Leopard before EOD today.
You mean, “Canada ponders”. Not the same.
"Global Village Space" from Pakistan where do you guys find these news outlets?
Excellent! Lets send more of our extremely under equipped troops with shockingly low morale to Ukraine! That’ll definitely help!
If we do send anything, it will likely be lightly armoured troops without the equipment to engage an armoured force and in insufficient numbers to even act as a credible speed bump.
If I am reading that Russia is planning to invade Ukraine in January on Reddit, how is every nation not sending military forces to stop it?
[deleted]
Why are media sources like this allowed on this sub but links to a Canadian news organization like Press Progress isn't?
This is NATO/US plan which we're helping:
Sending weapons to Ukraine, embolden their crazy side to attack their separatist provinces, say they should join NATO (their borders must be not in dispute for this to happen) -> Russia defends the largely Russian separatists and kicks out the Kiev army (no contest)->we all sanction Russia.  
Ukraine would lose, big time against the Russian army, but their government is extremely unpopular and could be tempted.
The Ukrainian army are conscripts and would get slaughtered.  It is a cruel ploy and we are just awful for entertaining this nonsense.
Right, I’m sure our aid will be vast and useful /s. We don’t have shit to provide aid with. Bunch of burnt out soldiers and 1/3 the equipment they should have.
Considering that Chrystia Freeland's ancestral background is Ukrainian and she is the second most powerfull person after Trudeau it whouldn't surprise me if Canada does end up becoming one of the leading contributing NATO nations in the Ukraine if not the leading nation.
It's important to note that Ukraine is not a full NATO member...it's an active partner of NATO, this means the other NATO nations aren't obligated to help the Ukraine.
I can't see the US doing more then sending a few weapons like the Javelin Anti-tank missile. That leaves Canada, UK, France, Germany, Italy and the other smaller NATO members.
I doubt France and Italy whould get involved in the Ukraine. Germany will end up debating the topic in there Parliament and decide not to get involved.
I could see the UK maybe sending a small contingents of the SAS or Royal Marines and smaller NATO members like Poland that border Russia do take the threat seriously and will also contribute to Ukraine.
The positive in all of this is it will give the goverment a reasonable excuse to expand the defense budget and buy the F-35's as a replacement for the F-18's.  Just my opinion whould be nice if Canada ends up with a mix fleet of Gripens and F-35's
Deploy the speedbump. Seriously, Russia can go as far as Eastern Europe and then it will face logistics challenges. After that, the west has time to mobilize and do what has to be done. Russia is a paper power at best right now, limited to menacing its neighbors.
How does “consider” turn into “is”? Article says that Canada is considering sending aid.
[This is a report from a combat observer from 2016](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Phillip-Karber/publication/316122469_Karber_RUS-UKR_War_Lessons_Learned/links/58f1576e458515ff23ab42bc/Karber-RUS-UKR-War-Lessons-Learned.pdf?origin=publication_detail)
I highly recommend everyone read it at least casually. It paints the clearest picture of what’s happening on the ground, and what could happen should a full scale war break out.
Maybe we can sexually misconduct them to oblivion !
Look out, they sent the guy with the gun. The Russians tremble!
Can we really spare to be sending away our last few slingshots?
Yes because the best way to invade, is to let everyone know you will invade before you do it /s. This is just one show for the plebs while money is washed .
Is this like when my cat sleeps on my keyboard in an effort to help me? So useful!
Lol good luck our government gave us 30 marines to help when a city flooded, at the same time sent more military to control a pipeline operation. 
I'm sure Ukraine will get the minimal amount while still looking like we're there politically.

Hmm you'd think the first surgery like this would have been done in the US considering it's their national bird or whatever.
I really hope these surgeons weren't paid with public money for this but I can't imagine who else would do that.
*He was ok with not dying*
Clearly you haven't met me
LOL, the USA was right alongside us in almost killing all of the Bald Eagles with DDT back in the 50s-70s. They almost helped drive their own national animal to extinction......on second thought we did the exact same thing with beaver hunting........huh guess North American nations are jerks to their animals in general :(
Why does it matter to you so much?
Personally I'd rather my tax dollars go towards saving a bald eagle than lining the pockets of some idiot in a suit.
Don't know, but.....Even if they were, isn't using a bit of money to save an amazing creature's life more worthwhile than a TON of the superfluous projects we put public funds into every day?
Because a saving a bald eagle is a waste of time, IMO? They're plentiful and scavengers.
No... no it's not.  
We don't have the resources to tackle the opioid crisis, mental health crisis, and suicide crisis in humans.  That's not even touching the backlog of suffering people due to Covid resource hogging.  Finding new avenue to spend out medical knowledge is the last thing we need.
Right but it seems a little morally reprehensible to jail someone for not giving you their money to perform an eagle's spinal surgery.
Just like politicians and businessmen and corporations. 
At least eagles are pretty to look at and contribute something useful to the ecosystem.
Just like junkies, do you wanna know how much we spend on them?
OH youre one those kinds of libertarians 
You know, no one is stopping you from picking up your personal belongings and just walking into the wilderness and trying to live off the land 
there is much of it you could go get lost and no one would come looking for you to make you pay taxes 
If you like living in a society with other people though - you have to stfu and pay taxes , some of which may be used on projects you dont necessarily agree with

Both FOI and ATIP requests are unfortunately burdensome, time consuming, and expensive to provide. There are journalists, lawyers, consultants, contractors and other professionals that file muliple requests for the same information on a regular basis. All the information sought needs to be analyzed, redacted, logically collated and preseainted to the requestor in their choice of media. I've seen ATIP requests so broad that there are literally 100 000 s of pages, and the requestor wants paper copies instead of digital. All to see why company A's bid was chosen over company's B and C's bid. Despite this information already being available on Canada.gc.ca's website with 5 minutes of research. Don't blame the nominal $5 fee, blame the professional requestors who clog the system.
You can always count on the NDP, no matter the province, to never govern as the progressive party it claims to be in election campaigns. Just like Liberals.
If you need a fee to access information I would not say there is freedom for people to access it.
Welcome to the province of B.C.: Bring Cash.
Pay $50 fee.
Get 5 black pages of redacted material. Or, better still, a memo stating that no information is available. 
Please re-submit your request, along with another $50.
Such fees are already in place in Ontario, and in many cases, they are based on the cost. 
I work in IT and sometimes I get requests from Town Clerk to do searches against various criteria. A simple search of email records of just a few people can take a good number of hours just on my end. That's the easy part. 
I then send the search results to the Clerk's office and they sift through the material before it is submitted to the requestor. 
$50?
That barely covers retrieval of archived mailboxes of former employees, but not actual searches of their content.
I wonder if you could argue that this would form 'Consideration' in a contractual sense.
So disappointed with the actions of the NDP and Premier John Horgan.  I was very optimistic about our government when the BC Liberal Party was defeated (and still am) and replaced by the NDP but the way Horgan and the NDP have acted and reacted is a big letdown.
*"The minister has said the fee would be between $5 and $50"*
We're living a in a police state! /s
Yikes
I can't agree more this this.
The amount of time and effort that goes into preparing an ATIP can be mind-boggling. 
Imagine having to collect every document, email, sticky note, and message you've sent on one subject Then, redact them according to some fuzzy and hard to understand guidelines, and organize all of it. Now imagine everyone in an organization doing that for a single request.  
It's not too much to say one request can cripple a team working on an important file for at least a week. In many cases, just so a journalist can take a line out of a briefing note out of context.
I'm not saying we should scrap ATIPs entirely, but I think the way it's administered now nets negative results for citizens because the public service has to pour so many resources into to, often with little impact. There's got to be a better way to make the government more transparent.
> I've seen ATIP requests so broad that there are literally 100 000 s of pages,
Because if you don't make that kind of request the government takes great glee in not giving you the information you want. 
The blame here is the government refusing to make data public by default. And snide bureaucrats who think their laziness is more important that the public's access to information the public owns.
And in this case the BC Liberals (conservatives) have been slamming the office with 10,000 requests for everything from meeting minutes to screenshots of ministers homescreen.
Specifically to bog down the system
The Alberta NDP were very progressive. The only argument against them is that they moved towards the center economically. 
The BC NDP have always been a liberal party with orange ties much like how the BC Liberals are really just conservatives.

Its now the Feedom of information act
Don't worry, both rich and poor people are charged the same exact fee so everyone is equal right?
Unless they've changed it since the last time I looked at the proposed bill a week or so ago, there is no fee for individuals to make FOI requests.  It's only a fee for organizations.
BC = **B**e **C**riminal
The toner is getting expensive to print out all that black
You mean you can't just print money, and hand a ton of it out?
https://betterdwelling.com/canadas-money-supply-is-growing-at-the-fastest-rate-in-over-30-years/
Money supply growing at fastest rate in 30 years. Inflation being the worst it's been since the 80's. Huge coincidence, right?
The government has printed roughly 1/4 of our money supply since the nations founding from 2019 to 2021.
What did you think would happen?
The government has so many reasons to desire high inflation while simultaneously underreporting it. The government has tons of expenses pegged to the fake inflation rate. It also reduces debt burden. Corporations and governments are insanely indebted right now and this is just another bail out
Section 18 (i) and (j) of the ***Bank of Canada Act***.
[***Section 18***](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/b-2/page-2.html#:~:text=not%20exceeding%20six%20months%20to%20the%20Government%20of%20Canada)
***(i)*** *make loans or advances for periods* ***not exceeding six months*** *to the Government of Canada...*
***(j)*** *make loans to the Government of Canada or the government of any province, but such loans outstanding at any one time* ***shall not, in the case of the Government of Canada, exceed one-third of the estimated revenue of the Government of Canada for its fiscal year***...
As a matter a fact, in the 2021 budget, Government of Canada's projected fiscal revenues are $355.1 Billions, one-third of $355.1B are $118B, and right now in BoC's balance sheet it has bought Government debts around $500B, way over the regulatory limit of $118B. Also BoC's QE buying Government bond has lasted for 1.5 years exceed 6 months' duration requirement by law.
Can someone has more expertise/knowledge telling us, if the BoC saw it's necessary and urgent to launch the QE at such big scale and long duration that far exceed the law's upper limits, WHY it has not asked the Parliament to VOTE and amend the law on the two articles FIRST, so BoC can proceed accordingly? Does the BoC ignore the law or what? Overspending reply on overprinting money, but the law does limit BoC's power to overprinting money in terms of quantities and durations.
Can someone explain? Do I miss something? Thanks.
Edit: Yeah, the Government may need high inflations for various reasons, but the law does restrict the power and limits (capped at 1/3 and 6 months) of BoC making loans to the Government, and Government needs to increase revenues from taxations on its own. BoC should be fully independent of the elected government, like the SCC.
Canada is in the middle of the pack when it comes to inflation in the OECD. And given the state of the world right now, there are fairly limited tools the government and Bank and Canada can use to reign inflation in.

Don’t worry, inflation will take care of itself according to Trudeau’s logic.
So, the government is doing this are they?  All over the world?  At the same time?  ALL of the world's governments secretly got together and, for the first time in history, are all working together secretly in order to raise inflation, are they?
No shit!
CPI doesn't measure inflation. It shouldn't be used.
At every level, municipal, Provincial and Federal! Municipal taxes up, water and garbage, also trying to find new taxes to charge, looking at storm water, Provincial pushing inflation with paying for safe supply and housing for homeless(buying hotels), and creating panic buying of goods from flooding, Federal pushing carbon taxes on everything you buy to live, food, heat, water, etc.. completely government caused! And they wonder why housing costs are rising! 🤣
Trudeau asked someone to translate this for him
Nothing in the article warrants the misleading headline.   
I suggest the best approach to inflation is “wait and see” for now. Before taking the usual economy-stifling, inflation-beating measures like raising interest rates and increasing taxes to address inflation, wait and see what happens when the supply bottlenecks are eased and COVID-19 is being well-managed.
The traditional tools used to address inflation are intended to reduce demand by putting people out of work and bankrupting businesses. So, on personal level would you rather have higher inflation or lower inflation but no job and no business? That’s the choice.
Does this guy explain how the Canadian government is driving inflation in the entire world?
No?
I'm shocked. Shocked I say!!!!
F'king idiot.
Telling the base what they want to hear episode 29
It was easy to accept the Canadian governments intentions, but then you have to understand that the Canadian population is completely complacent. This will lead to the conclusion that whatever the plan the government and CCP has for Canada will be accepted and it is inevitable.
But CBC’s Aaron Wherry assured me none of it was Trudeau’s fault!
Here's a quote from another National Post columnist.
>But the bottom line is that inflation is currently a global phenomenon. It is being influenced by external factors like supply kinks and global bond yields.  
So which is it? Do they even know?
That graduate degree in economics is paying off with insights like these. In other news, water is wet and the sky is blue.
So Trudeau is to blame for inflation, but the entire western world is facing the same problem. In the US its all Bidens fault, etc etc. Typical garbage reporting from right wing opinion pieces.
Is there any other entity that can drive inflation?
its okay guys, as long as the conservatives aren't in power we are good

Sounds like she's spreading hate and inciting violence, her ass needs to be in jail, now.
Um….. who is this imposter… should I pursue legal action for using my likeness?
Why hasn't this terrorist been arrested yet?
Funny, I got a personal email from her at the business I work at with a signed letter in my name to “stop experimental vaccinations immediately”. Like wtf you crackhead I’m just a pilot flying planes around the Yukon.

 what the fuck

Inciting violence. Throw the book at them.
What if I declare myself Emperor of Canada and declare her "order" null and void?
Explain to me in one sentence why this person has not be arrested.
Arrest and jail it now for inciting violence. How is this not terrorism? Get on it police
Ok can’t they arrest her fucking crackhead ass?!!!

Man, I'm so glad Trudeau flew down there just to tell them he will set up a committee. 😂
Striking a committee ?  Is there no emergency preparedness protocol already in place?
I have no faith in our federal and provincial governments to make this right.
Another committee to have another study to have another committee to have another study.
I am deeply disappointed on many different levels by the poor actions of Justin Trudeau and John Horgan
Excellent. Another committee.
You get a committee and you get a committee! Committees for everyone!
Justinflation
Is it the WE Charity?
he is only 2 weeks to late
What a waste of time , money and jet fuel contributing to the problem. Hey I’m a genius PM so let’s run a committee, take some polls and interfere with the Provinces authority and mandate to be prepared for and deal with this emergency.  Soooo , where did our provincial tax dollars go if they weren’t spent on emergency preparedness??  They are all a bunch of failures at their jobs.  Responsible to the public ,,, yeah right. Our gov on all levels is a joke and we the tax payers are the punch line.  Time for massive and sweeping change like Suzuki said , shit gonna start blowing up soon. Worse than it already is.
If Abbotsford had been east of the Rockies he would have handed out cash two weeks ago.   
Particularly if it was in Alberta.
We’re just a quick stop on the way to Tofino.
How else can he get SNC Lavalin as primary contractor?
It's more likely that this is going to be very expensive and expensive project, so it does make sense to dedicate some specific resources to the task
The recovery is gonna be billions of dollars in spending from multiple levels of government, it makes sense to have oversight and coordination
But the mayor of Abbotsford seems to be on his A game.  Provincial government… disappointing.
Good for you!
Oof

Turn them right back around and send them back. The US is a safe country.
This country is a clown show.
Just in time for the new African variant
"Opening" an unauthorized crossing is completely fucked up when you think about it. This country is ran by clowns.
Unsurprisingly, the comments are off…
Do they require a PCR test?
I'm so happy for this. Joe Bidens USA is soooo dangerous.
"But the USA under Trump is dangerous!"
(Biden gets in)
Y'all were saying something?
Do they tip the Mounties, SQ, and CBSA officers who carry their bags for them?
But why
so they're officially letting people illegally cross? how does that work exactly. wonder how many suitcases stuffed with future crime guns the mounties have dutifully carried across for them
From experience I can tell you that this is a complete show of incompetence by our government and the budget for this is enormous. A Regional Treatment Center has been built at a ridiculous cost until they're  taken by bus to an Urban Treatment Center in order to set up benefits and free accomodations. And when you see the people and their goods being handled you get to see that this is nothing but a free stay until they hit the lottery.

For anyone interested how much of a joke our border is.
It should be permanently closed. US is a safe country.
I mean other than it’s probably safer than where they came from, why? Housing market is insane, cost of living is high, inflation is 4.4%. 
Are they automatically receiving benefits as soon as they are granted refugee status? I have no idea how a refugee can survive here if they’re without family already in the country.
Surely justin can accommodate all these people? Considering he created this disaster
Unironically should build a wall there, topped with razor wire. The USA is a safe country and we should accept absolutely no fake refugees from them
Swayze express
I remember this episode.
How does someone work as a nurse for a year and not get immediately get recognized as a fraud, I'm a tractor mechanic and I could pick up on someone faking their qualifications pretty damn quick and a tractor is way less complicated than human physiology, or at leat I'm assuming it is because I dropped biology in grade11.
She gave injections and medication. Scary
I wonder if she was any good at the job.
She learned during her first time impersonating a nurse in Ottawa.
A nurse doesn’t necessarily have to figure out the problems, she likely could get by doing the menial tasks picking up things as she went along. (Not safely mind you, nor with the proper license to track/lay accountability accordingly)
RN here.  It may not appear on first glance to the public, but there is a high level of critical thinking/assessment/planning/followthrough that does come with the job, it is not merely "menial tasks".  Those tasks could be hard to "fake" over time, depending on the setting involved, especially if said menial tasks has a crimp thrown in or does not go according to plan.  If you don't have the knowledge base and experience, then what? 
I can't believe that she went this far without being caught in this last episode.  Most provinces have a check of sorts, that employers use, and the public can look up a nurse on the registry.  When I graduated (30 yrs ago), was liscenced in my first province of hire, which of course meant I graduated from an accreddited program, and passed the national exam.  Any time I worked in another jurisdiction in Canada, I needed to apply to that provincial or territorial association, who (is supposed to) verify your practice hours, and professional standing in the province or territory you came from.  I realize this person had aliasis, but perhaps the ball was dropped somewhere as well.
I’m not saying you in particular, but it’s in all fields where If you play your cards right you can fake your way through a lot, the movie catch me if you can shows multiple jobs a real person faked, including being a doctor, pilot and teacher - all without having the training. 
I by no means meant to belittle you or your profession as nurses get less respect than they deserve as hospital can’t run without them, and many nurses are more capable than many doctors. But there’s always those few in any job that always seem to get away without /really/ working.
I forgot about that movie!!! 
No worries, I did not mean to come across as offended or snarky if that's what you took it as.  It's all good. :)
I imagine she made tons of errors that got reported and management investigated. unfortunately there’s many steps management has to take over multiple months before firing someone
I just realized how I may have come across as is all, I’d hate to be adding to the nurse hate right now

>As a point of comparison a total of 8,355 unvaccinated individuals under the age of 60 have ended up in hospital with COVID-19 over the same time-period and 1,722 of them have required treatment in the ICU.
So 8,355 unvaccinated (under age 60) clogging up our hospitals vs 83 fully vaccinated people.
ICU was 1,722 vs 9...
[removed]
So why do we have any restrictions at all for under 60?
~~The headline is wrong~~. It's 9 vaccinated people under 60 who have ended up in ICU while 1,755 unvaccinated people under 60 have ended up in ICU.
I read this as “one in nine” and shit myself
I definitely read that title as "only 9 orangutan"
[removed]
The other part of the headline is that there have been over 17,000 cases of COVID19 amoung unvaccinated people, compared to the 60 from vaccinated.   
I'm pretty much at the point that we should pass legislation making a special exception where unvaccinated people should pay for their ICU/Hospital care for COVID-19 because fuck these guys.
Title is slightly misleading. It should read "Only nine FULLY VACCINATED Ontarians under the age of 60 have ended up in the ICU with a breakthrough case of COVID-19 and 1,722 non-vaccinated ontarions under 60 ended up in ICU"
Not to rain on the parade but the "same time period" is "over the last year" so assuming that means going back to Nov 2020, it's not exactly fair to include the peak months of COVID when vaccines weren't even available in the comparison. 
I know it wouldn't change the finding and overall message, but it annoys me to see people spreading misinformation even for the right reasons.
This is bad data without background info. This time period includes a huge period of time where vaccines were only available to elderly people.
Nov 25, 2020 to may 1, 2021 was about 360,223 covid cases. May 1 - Nov 25 was about 106,510 cases.
Ignoring the time taken to uptake vaccinations in the younger populations, that's a huge difference in sample size. It would have made much more sense to normalize this data by vaccination status... But they did not.
What is this time period and were vaccines available to all of these people in this whole time period?
Yep. Most of these hospitalizations are preventable. People are dying because the hospitals are plugged up thanks to anti-vaxxers and the conservative politicians enabling them.
Yeah! You see, clearly the vaccine doesn't work!
/s
Even more striking when you consider the populations on either side.

*fully vaccinated & under 60* *
Because the virus doesn't care how old someone is...?
It'll still transmit and infect anyone it comes in contact to.  This only speak of the severity of the infection, not it's transmissibility.
It's hilarious because [in this thread, with the title "Conservatives call for travel restrictions"](https://old.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/r2sr2z/conservatives_call_for_ban_on_travel_from/) every single top comment is saying that this is a great idea and that Trudeau will never do it because he's stupid and thinks it's racist. 
But in this thread, with "Ottawa prepares..." it's all "freedom is over" and "hey treaudope let us get back to normal"
Did anyone actually read the article?
It says from South Africa (and other neighbouring countries). Unless you have to plans to travel to/from that region not sure why your freedom is in jeopardy.
So it begins, again....
If we go into another general lockdown, with CERB re-instituted I am taking it this time.  Last time I didn't as I am considered an essential worker but I know of those that took CERB, invested in stocks/crypto and paid it back.
And when they don't work people will just say they weren't harsh enough or weren't implemented fast enough. Deja vu.
Good to know that full freedom ended forever in March 2020
WHO literally said travel restrictions doesn't work, and it only cause harms but hey since we listen to them right?
Why are paywall articles allowed ?

Please just shut down the borders completely. SA just detected it before anyone else, it's no doubt been circulating in other countries. Shut them down until we know which countries are safe and which are not.
HEY FORD, WE NEED YA AS PRIME MINISTER!
Lol its true
Two people were originally charged with manslaughter in the death of an RCMP officer. One is now charged with first-degree murder and the other is charged with accessory after the fact to murder. Murder is first-degree murder when the accused knows that the victim is a police officer acting in the course of their duties. Manslaughter is manslaughter whether the victim is a police officer or not.
The victim in this case was struck and killed by a vehicle which he had just stopped. To convict the driver of murder, Crown would have to prove that the driver intended to kill the officer, or alternatively that he intentionally struck the officer, intended to cause serious bodily harm, and subjectively foresaw that death was likely to result. To-convict the co-accused of accessory after the fact, the crown would have to prove that they assisted the driver for the purpose of helping them escape.

If the evidence at trial doesn't prove the charged offences, the two accused could be convicted of the lesser included offences of manslaughter and accessory after the fact to manslaughter.
10 points for this solid explanation
10 bucks says they plea down.
except for the fact that it was a cop they really don't do much in Canada in way of punishing people.  [This guy beheaded a man and ate him](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Tim_McLean) on a bus and only got less than 7 years. He is better now and will keep taking his medications so no longer a threat to the public. hmm
While I'm also not necessarily in agreement with the full outcome of [Will Baker's court case and subsequent unabated freedom](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/tim-mclean-bus-will-baker-absolute-discharge-1.3984141) (absolute discharge), the outcome will only be similar in this case if the accused can reasonably prove an insanity defense. AKA history of medication, outbursts/events, etc. 
They also killed a cop, and the system tends to act a little more heavy handed when it comes to the deaths of public servants, particularly LEO members. The general public is viewed as a little more expendable to the courts, *in my opinion*.
He was found NCR. 
The two cases are completely different.
And no one knows who he is. He changed his name legally.
Almost everything in this post is wrong.
He wasn't "punished". He was found not criminally responsible by reason of mental disorder and was treated. 
Conversely, *every* civilian adult convicted of murder, in all Canadian history, was sentenced either to death by hanging or to life in prison.
His new name is Will Baker and he is of Chinese descent. [You can find photos of him online.](https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/02/12/11/will-baker.jpg?width=990&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=982:726,smart)

Interesting wording
Fascinating coming from a concerning variant of politician such as himself.
Wonder what his daughter thinks about this one.
Who cares.
Another full lockdown incoming.  Get that toilet paper well ahead of time, get your hair cut next week, prepare for another zoom Christmas.  If you run a restaurant or bar, time to sell, cut your losses and get out of the industry.   With these constant variants and lockdowns you are finished and running a restaurant or bar is no longer viable unless it's a takeout pizza joint.
Sad but true
Sigh....just as it seemed like we were finally out of the woods...yet another stupid dumb Variant has to come around the corner and ruin everything, and act as a grim reminder that whether we like it or not, this is far from over. What worse is that if this actually spreads, my Christmas plans of visiting dad are going to be going down the drain, after months of planning and hype/excitement and getting everything organized, planned out and ready, of that anticipation and all of the planning ahead to finally see my dad again...will be all but gone.
Let's just hope that people actually listen and take this seriously, and we are able to efficiently stop it from leaving South Africa so we can strangle it into submission and dodge another two years of this BS, and having this Travel Ban seems like the best way to do it.
But knowing we live in the worst timeline imagineable, I'm going to assume nothing that I said is coming to pass, and I'll have to cancel my plans and possibly move them to next year, because as much as I want to be proven wrong, life is a joke and hates all of us. So the worst case scenario is going to happen regardless.
https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/07/how-scientists-detect-new-covid-19-variants
No one was concerned 4 months ago when this variant was discovered.
the 2 HK cases were both fully vaccinated and transmitted to each other
transmission occured in quarantine hotel from across two rooms
multiple samples taken in both rooms show virus passed between each room
both of them had very high Ct values, indicating virus evaded vaccine and is easily replicating.. and that it took a few tests to finally show up
lol this is extremely bad news for international travel of any kind. everyone needs china style 14 day quarantine regardless of your vaccination status.
very soon it should be necessary for any travel of any kind
Testing everyone at entry, vaccinated or not, Does not sit well with me. Im thinking the government doesn’t want to relinquish the power we’ve allowed them.

Oh my god, can this guy fuck off? How long are people going to put up with this??
Funny how quickly the new variant from England with no symptoms died off
According to her she has an immune system and is not worried.
Exactly.

The new normal
Perk up a little…. we made it this far at least. Also, go see your Dad.
Looks like this is a fake story. The only mention of any date is in byline and in the URL. There is a link in this story (on the words "have discovered") that goes to a page that is dated Nov 25, 2021 which is a neat trick for a page written on July 12, 2021. Also, if you go to web.archive.org for this page from July 13, 2021 (https://web.archive.org/web/20210713043309/https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/07/how-scientists-detect-new-covid-19-variants/) , the story is almost identical except for the some changes at the beginning to suddenly mention this new variant.
All of that seems to indicate that someone has gone in and altered this old story in the past day to spread some FUD.
From the link you shared:
>Scientists in South Africa have discovered a small number of cases of a new COVID variant. They’re working to understand its potential implications but told a news conference that it had a ‘very unusual constellation’ of mutations.
>**They’re concerned** that they could help it evade the body’s immune response and make the variant - named B.1.1.529 - more transmissible.
It literally says they were concerned four months ago. Did politicians act four months ago? Well let's see... Jason Kenney declared the pandemic over and "best summer ever!"; BC lifted restrictions due to overwhelming public pressure then brought them back because Delta started spreading fast. Saskatchewan shit their bed and Trudeau get an election erection.
So to say no one was concerned is misleading. SCIENTISTS were concerned. Politicians were kicking the can down the road.
And here we are.
"That it's almost entirely their fault."
There, finished the headline.
It’s not unfair to dismiss the Trudeau government’s Speech from the Throne on Tuesday as a regurgitation of recent Liberal promises, and devoid of anything resembling a new vision. You couldn’t even say it achieved the more modest goals of being somewhat newish, or sort of fresh.
Instead, the speech delivered by Governor-General Mary Simon could easily have been written a year ago, what with its focus on reconciliation, climate change, vaccinations and, as its title put it, “building a resilient economy” in the postpandemic era.
If anything, the Throne Speech by the second straight Trudeau minority government cements the notion that the election the Prime Minister called in August might as well not have happened, for all the change it wrought.
STORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT
Perhaps, then, the only way to make the speech interesting is to look at what wasn’t in it – sort of the way Sovietologists used to examine who wasn’t standing next to Stalin during the May Day parade in Moscow, in order to better understand what was going on behind the walls of the Kremlin.
Based on that kind of analysis, the Trudeau government is squarely in the camp of those who are betting that the soaring inflation rate in Canada is a transitory result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and doesn’t require a response.
The Throne Speech mentioned “inflation” only once, and in doing so made sure to call it “a challenge that countries around the world are facing,” just in case anyone thought it was a problem peculiar to Canada.
Fair enough. The supply chain issues brought on by the pandemic, and the jump in energy prices and in consumer demand as COVID-19 restrictions have been eased, are global in scale.
But the government’s two Throne Speech planks in its effort to “keep tackling the rising cost of living” – housing and child care – are responses to issues of affordability that were conceived prior to this year’s jump in the headline inflation rate.
The $10-a-day child-care program that, as of Wednesday, Ottawa had negotiated with every province except Ontario and New Brunswick, would be happening whether inflation was a concern or not. They are unrelated issues, even if it’s true that lower child-care costs will help many Canadian parents balance their budgets as other prices rise.
The Liberals’ housing plans, meanwhile, could actually contribute to inflation. The programs mentioned in the Throne Speech – a First-Time Home Buyer Incentive, a Rent-to-Own program and efforts to reduce closing costs for first-time buyers – make it easier to buy in a hot market by lowering borrowing and administrative costs, which in turn potentially creates more demand and higher prices.
STORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT
In short, the Throne Speech does little more than grudgingly acknowledge that people are talking about inflation.
That includes the Conservative Opposition, which has been hammering away at the issue, right down to the rising cost of breakfast fare.
But it also includes the Bank of Canada, whose deputy governor Paul Beaudry said in a speech on Tuesday that Canadians could be hit with higher debt-servicing costs as the pandemic fades. Economists expect the central bank to raise its policy interest rate next year in response to recent jumps in inflation.
Canada’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 4.7 per cent on a year-over-year basis in October, up from a 4.4 per cent increase in September. October was the largest gain since February, 2003, according to Statistics Canada.
As worrisome as those numbers are, it is still unclear how long-term the inflation problem will prove to be.
For instance, gasoline prices have risen dramatically, but their current inflation is in part because of a sharp drop in those same prices through most of 2020. If gas prices are stripped out of October’s numbers, the CPI drops to 3.3 per cent, which isn’t that far from the Bank of Canada’s target inflation rate of between 1 and 3 per cent.
STORY CONTINUES BELOW ADVERTISEMENT
If the Throne Speech tells us anything, it’s that the Liberal government is among those hoping inflation will sort itself out in 2022, and won’t turn into an issue that could hurt it at the polls, or affect its own borrowing plans.
We may know more when the government releases a financial update later this fall and has to use a word that got even less play in the Throne Speech: deficits.

I wonder if a prorogued parliament and needless election would have prevented this?

Edit: I love that good data showing that Canada is doing fine relative to the rest of the world is downvoted to oblivion because it doesn't fit a narrative that the Liberals have single handedly fucked the world's purchasing power with policies that were mostly supported by the opposition parties.
Hmm. Seems like a really good opportunity for the rich to get richer.
All wages in Canada should be locked in with inflation so that foreign businesses can't take advantage of workers like this.  Canada is just a big investment to the entire world and the entire world is holding their hands out NOW.

Kinda off topic and maybe it’s just me but we’ve had quite a few throne speeches in the last few years, I know in the uk they have one every year and we don’t do that here but seems like a lot lately (not that I’m complaining I love all the pomp and circumstance)
You mean oppress-flation
How would that have affected the rest of the globe? What's happening, inflation-wise, is happening everywhere. The Liberals do not influence the economics of every other country that is dealing with this issue.
I wonder if it would have been a needless election if the conservatives could win more than a ham sandwich.
People have no motivation to put money into savings though with interest rates being so low. Debt is cheap
**Wait, that's not necessarily true at all.**
First of all, inflation doesn't necessarily have a self-regulating feedback loop the way you suggest it does. Yes, to some degree as prices rise demand falls, like in econ 101. But that's not the end of the story. If there is a strong expectation that prices will *always be higher tomorrow*, it causes people to rush to buy whatever goods they can, even if they're unaffordable.
This increases the velocity of money, increases revenue, increases wages, increases demand, increases shortages, and increases prices. That's a self-propelling feedback loop that can cause inflation to drive *more* inflation.
Secondly, the CAD is stable relative to world currencies, in part because every country is deploying similarly stimulative measures. The US and EU certainly have been. Prices are likewise going up in all these countries, so while the CAD may not be special, it's more accurate to say that all the currencies are losing value at similar rates, rather than that the CAD is stable.
Lastly, how much money do you expect people to put into savings with real interest rates at minus 4.5% and falling?
Inflation can happen if the money supply grows faster than the economic output under otherwise normal economic circumstances. Inflation, or the rate at which the average price of goods or services increases over time,
Wtf kind of rational and informational comment is this bullshit? Eat downvote
Well there goes my $638 million cocaine party
Just the cost of doing business for cartels. The global cocaine trade is worth ~$100 billion a year.
For every package seized another 99 end up in the hands of users. The supply side strategy of the war on drugs is a proven failure.
There goes my White Christmas.
I'll take some. It's XMAS party season
They should sell it to buy another couple ships
Oh thank god, sell it and knock 600m off our deficit for the year.
Cartels getting blasted by the Harry D
Wonder where it goes.  Like hand it over to the US to redistribute? Burn it?
>Once the drugs were moved from the smuggling vessel, Harry DeWolf’s entire crew of 77 sailors formed a human chain to get the cocaine safely stowed away under lock and key. 
>“It’s a lot of work,” Gleason said. “Everybody had to chip in, including yours truly. The captain was in line with the crew moving this stuff.”  
I bet everyone had some extra energy moving those tightly sealed bales. You ever wonder what the different governments do with all the confiscated drugs? They dont just dump it in the ocean or burn it back at the station. What happens is a shrouded process, for good reason, but if you start doing the math something doesnt add up.
Oh great now they're going to be cutting cocaine with more dangerous drugs.
Wow, 637 million in coke, great work.
And you wonder why dealers are cutting shit with fentanyl…
Not saying cocaine is bad because it’s bad as fuck but  we need to focus on the opioid epidemic.
I wonder where it'll get resold in a couple years
Ahem your 218 million dollar coke party sir
$638 million? Wow that's a lot. I wonder where the drug runners were planning to take $500 million worth of cocaine. It would be hard to sneak $400 million worth of cocaine through a border, but $250 million is a lot of money you could make. Still for $100 million I think the risk might be worth the reward but $10 million would set you up nicely in most places. But it's probably easier just to smuggle $10 million in cocaine which is why they only went with $5 million in cocaine. Well done to the Harry D for intercepting that $35,000 brick of cocaine though.
Totally fair point but this is over 0.5% of their presumed total business.
Are you implying that this $450million seizure and subsequent chain of custody won’t see this $350million annexation of criminal property be properly recorded and stored as evidence prior to any criminal proceedings, and then the entirety of this $150million windfall won’t be properly ~~distributed~~ destroyed ?
Uhhh, they just toss it in overboard.
Depends. Once it comes ashore in empty ammo cans it's anyone's guess who smuggles it from the magazine.... 🤔🧐....
When you start adding up the numbers, the total amount of cocaine seized and the amount capable of production, year after year, something just doesnt come out right. There is more cocaine out there than can be produced, year after year, by far. Trust me I did the meth on this.

They watched it get banned one by one around the world. They read the same credible reports of risk and liability. The Canadian government dragged their feet and gave this cabal years to prepare. They chose to ignore it and now want compensation. A joke.
We need to rebuild a credible anti-trust movement. Our oligopolies hold back our economies and societies more than any groups. And they capture our governance. In the words of Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, they are a market failure and threaten even functioning capitalism. Break. Them. Up.

Why should they be compensated for making poor business decisions? 
Even Stevie Wonder could have seen the writing on the wall!
Canadian telecom companies are the best compensated ON THE PLANET. Their profits compared to anywhere else could only be called obscene. We are literally the worst on earth for this.
They've seen exactly what the rest of the five eyes have been up to and counted on us to be spineless (so far they've been right!)
Pay them *nothing.* Maybe they'll make better decisions next time.
How has Huawei not been banned yet? I remember Liberal apologists saying it would be done after the Michaels were released. I guess not.
Shouldn't have taken it from the evil authoritarians!
Suffer the consequences.
So they've gone out and bought shit tons of Huawei equipment, knowing this was a distinct likelihood. Probably barely negotiated the contracts/prices and will then demand compensation, and use that compensation to negotiate proper rates from other suppliers. Pocket the difference, profit.
They can fuck off. If you've been using Huawei equipment this was a risk of doing business with them.
EDIT: if they've got really old Huawei gear, from say at least 2016 or earlier, then we could talk about paying for the depreciated value of it (not replacement value).
How about we let them maintain their oppressive oligarchy for a few more years instead?
Is this… reason for me to switch back to Rogers (Fido)?!
Look, they can afford this.
If there is a way to piss away money and fuck over taxpayers the Liberals will make sure to exploit it.
We bought Galen Weston new freezers for his stores because he couldn't possible use any of his profits to support his own businesses' needs, so why would anyone be surprised our biggest monopolist telecomms are also in on getting free money from all of us?
Demand better. Next election vote to ditch the one-party PC-Liberal axis that is killing our kid's futures.
Bell and Rogers should be nationalized and be treated as a matter of national security.
No problem, we'll get around to it after we do the whole gun buyback thing...

The fact we're only spending 24 billion on our military is fucking insane.
Defending our boarders is one of the fundamental functions a Government **should** be doing yet it's basically a rounding error in our case.
It's also scary given how important the North West Passage will become in the future and we basically have no way to stake our sovereignty over the area.
And little to show for it.

That works out to around $26K for every single person in Canada. Considering that the median income in Canada is around $38K -- and that is just people working. The $26K figure is for every man, woman and child.
So not only are our governments spending like crazy, they are spending way more than they collect in income tax.
It was only a matter of time before we reached this mark. The rich are richer than ever so they're paying more taxes than ever.
no shit
So total government spending is about 50% of GDP. No wonder everyone wants a government sector job.
I wonder what the figure is for the USA?
That's one way to control the markets. Just keep handing money out like candy. What could go wrong?
The government here (provincial and federal) is too busy expanding itself - more public sector jobs, more useless services, more free stuff to the bottom feeders!!!!
Hey, wait a minute - who gonna pay for all this shit when no one has a job and taxes aren’t getting paid??
I found out today, the City of Toronto has over  38,000 people employed!!!! LOL

The city of Chicago has 8million people and employees 45,000 people.
It’s out of control.
Balls to the wall! Big money for all.
“Spending” 
And then goes on to mention Health Care. Education. Social Protection. 
So you mean things we need to have a functioning society. Got it.
Yup.
If you visited a doctor. You saw it. 
If you have children of your own or have children in your family or you attended a school. You saw it. 
If you ever become unemployed. You’ll see it in the form of EI. 
If you grow old. You’ll see it in the form of OAS. 
If you become disabled. You’ll see it in the form disability benefits.
A few years of high inflation that will be a reality.
>It's also scary given how important the North West Passage will become in the future and we basically have no way to stake our sovereignty over the area.
The reality is that we're functionally an American vassal state. We're entirely dependent on them for our continued existence in the face of virtually any military threat. The degree to which we're economically dependant on them was highlighted by our willingness to let them dictate who we can permissibly trade with (USMCA clause). Our sovereignty is essentially performative.
We're spending about 1.5% of GDP on military. The US is spending 3.7% of GDP. I think we can all agree that we shouldn't be spending as much as the US, but we're in line with a lot of our NATO allies. Maybe we could up the spending closer to 2% but it's not like we're alone in our funding levels.
Little to show for it? You realize if the government did nothing we would actually be in a worse position right?
An accurate statement that doesn't mean much honestly and betrays a lack of understanding of what money is.
Each dollar of government spending is a dollar of private sector income (either as income for individuals in the public or private sector or as revenue in the private sector). That's not to say the government should be spending more, but the real question is, is the government making the private sector compete against it for resources and if the government hadn't spend $10, would the private sector have done a better job of spending it.
Or ... indigenous people actually have a wide variety of priorities and situations, so it's good for some, bad for others, and maybe we shouldn't talk about them like they're a homogeneous blob.

Damn I just about threw out all my deodorant sticks. This is the worst kind of clickbait.
I’ve had problems with old spice in the past with pit sticks. I don’t remember the scents but they basically caused extremely painful rashes or chemical burns... at least that’s what it felt like. Spent roughly 2 weeks gently washing, disinfecting and applying creams to my arm pits twice a day.
Well, this's really going to stink.

Ridiculous. It’s the aerosol deodorants. They just went with this image cause the majority of people use this form of deodorant, all for the fuckin clicks.
I immediately thought the same. Remember when journalism was a thing?
Need that click-bait, baby.
They finally changed the picture on it. Only took them 15 hours.
You saw a picture and immediately made assumptions? 
Without having to scroll, I see a link to the announcement as well as a specification about the type of deodorant. 
I first heard of it on the radio and it wasn't stated which line was affected, just that some were and that you should verify. Given the type of contamination was mentioned however, you could've made the association if you knew about the propellants used in a lot of these types of aerosols. Not everyone does, and I personally didn't click at the time, even though I know. 
It's literally just stock imagery. They switched out to the propellant types later.
It worked on me… haha. Bastards.
Glad I'm not the only one to notice this. The click desperation is just sad.
Uh not on BlogTO, no.
>You saw a picture and immediately made assumptions?
Stop defending clickbait. You are looking like a moron.

Worked on me and I already knew it was the aerosol! Thought maybe there was a new development and it involved the solids. Fear is a powerful motivator.
What? The pic was eventually changed but the og was probably just a stock pic for all you know. There's not that much consideration going into posts like that.
It's possible to criticize clickbait, as well as criticize the people who burn down their houses in response to it.

I don't think any of my school washrooms had doors in the first place, if they did they were always open. If the bathroom is designed right, you shouldn't be able to see anything other than a short hall anyways.
TIL not having exterior doors on washrooms is a big deal... 
Every school I went too were like that, all the malls near where I live too. It's a very common thing and I really don't understand what's the deal.
Why is this news
Sometimes it really does feel like we are devolving as a society.
A high school I worked at had washrooms that were designed without doors. No urinals in the guys' washrooms and the stalls were a bit more private than most.  The reason for this design was greater accessability for the physically disabled and no washroom doors to touch (lower germ transmission).  Security may have played into the design as well.
I would eat so many beans.
Public washrooms are typically designed so that you can't see into the areas that would be considered private through the exterior door, because the door is opening and closing all the time.  It's not like you open the door and the first thing you see is a bank of urinals or peoples' underwear around their ankles through the bottom of the stalls.
If someone needs a "moment of privacy", they can go sit in a stall for a minute or two.
If students are caught slacking off or cutting class, then give them a warning and if caught again, call the parents.
If caught vaping, same thing. 
IOW, and this is a real doozy of an idea, if they break the rules, they get some form of punishment. Unfortunately, the P word (tee hee) brings up imagery of a severe beating, when it can be made a learning experience that actions have consequences.
It's not like the students will be trussed up as in that scene from Starship Troopers where Rico takes a lashing. Great movie BTW.
I hath been M'Lorded and Mortified. My fedora remains untipped.
So none of the staff have doors on their washroom either, right?
In my junior high school, 20 years ago, the washrooms had no exterior doors. I don't see the big deal.
So then how do we expect bullies to give nerds and geeks a swirly without getting interrupted by some meddling teacher?  This will disrupt the entire balance of the high school social hierarchy.
Honestly, most boy's bathrooms need to be aired out anyway.
My Toronto high school dosent have washroom doors, they have a weird hallway entrance with a dividing brickwall that leads into the washroom like a snake tunnel.
Have people legit never been to a public bathroom where there is no actual external door and you just walk in? This is the same thing. From the pictures, it looks like you wouldn't be able to see anyone going about their "business" or even washing their hands. I could be wrong though.
It's not like the took the stall doors off.
Fine until burrito day...

Let's get few things out of the way... 1st, increase in prime rate (BoC) will be within reasonable range. In fact, I'd argue, it will be in a range for a healthy economy that does not require boost. 
2nd, having some insight into MBS financial products (securitization of residential mortgages) and general consumer rating in Canada, I can tell you that incidence of mortgage default in Canada is super low. It rarely happens and that's why it's one of the most safe products in the country - [as of Aug 31st, 2021, it's 0.18%](https://cba.ca/mortgages-in-arrears)
3rd, price correction, if it comes, will come from multi-factor incidents, something that happens over time, a year or two. Primary factors would be, significant GDP contraction over 4 quarters that affects major cashflow and earnings of the corporations. Considering that Canadian corporations sit on enormous amounts of cash, they feel pretty well about withstanding cashflow issues. [Even Freeland was talking about it](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/freeland-wants-ideas-on-how-to-unleash-cash-hoards-here-s-what-experts-said-1.1533891). Likelihood of some sudden price turn around is a fantasy. 
4th, one of the most important factors though is political stability and money cannot buy that. For all the issues people complain and whine about, including this sub and including ME, Canada is one of the rare countries in the world with peaceful population, stable political process, somewhat smooth Confederation dynamic with no major debilitating protests like we see in other countries, including Anglo-Saxon countries like Australia, US and UK. That fact is worth trillions and is often overlooked by analysts who only look at the numbers. 
What I would be interested is a slow down (which is not a correction) and Government participation in making other cities in Ontario and BC more attractive for people to live. However, it's juts 36 million people so it's harder than it looks. 
TL; DR ~ mortgage specialist has a tunnel vision
Gamestop never corrected....Housing to the moon then
Headline just wanted to attach gme for clicks
Haven't seen a  100% gain in a day yet so not exactly like GameStop just yet!!
Diamond hands baby!
💎🖐🤚💎🚀🚀🚀
I don’t think mortgages are shorted past the free float. But yeah
>the housing market is about to collapse, it can't possibly sustain this level of growth!
Man I have been hearing this on the news since I was looking up flash cartoons on Newgrounds.
I know it’s unlikely because Canada stupidly built all of its wealth around housing and so no matter who’s in power, the government’s priority is coddling boomers and existing homeowners and will thus fight tooth-and-nail to prevent a housing bubble burst. But oh man, I’m so sick of seeing hardworking, educated people who have the misfortune of not having wealthy parents to top up the down payment getting their dreams of ownership crushed. There would be some serious Schadenfreude in watching all those grinning silver spoon asswipes bragging about snagging a house for $150k over asking having the bottom fall out from under them.
I just checked and GameStop stock is still at an absurdly high level (roughly $200).
For comparison, before he internet got involved, it traded in the single digits. 
It has not been "corrected" at all.
It’s the one investment where it’s socially acceptable to YOLO your entire life savings on margin.
Diamond hands apes hold on to your houses
Can't stop, won't stop
That would suggest some of us will become rich.
Housing will never correct here, our housing market has been going up for 24 years straight. Eventually a basic house will cost 2-3 million and people will still be buying it
Is shitadel shorting the housing market too?
They shorted the housing market over 120% and refuse to close?
Correction or no I don't really care. My plan is to buy a house and live in it. Renting until the fabled crash happens just isn't worth it.

Legault 🤡
Well, I don't think it is just indigenous people that also share this view of Legault.
We don't need a headline for that do we? He's a political leader who tells certain groups they should dress more like the Quebecois majority, punishes them if they don't, and says it's for their own good and the good of Quebec. Of course he's paternalistic.
6 month extension to allow people to flip their 18 plus homes; and have enough time to flee the country so we can't prosecute. See the system works!
Its BC. The commission probably laundered the money they were paid.
Let me summarize the report:
There’s extensive money laundering but we can’t do anything about it without hurting the real estate market we’ve been propping up so 🤷‍♂️
Waste of time ! to be honest, they all know what was going down.
I mean it's not like the BC Libs had anything to do with it. They were outstanding and not corrupt and totally didn't turn a blind eye. Cough Rich Coleman and Cristy cough.
All this committee is doing is looking into the source, means, and ways to combat money laundering. It isn't an investigation, it's just meant to look like they are doing something. 
The last investigation into the money laundering at BC casinos ended after the members stated that it was too dangerous to investigate the perpetrators. [Source](https://globalnews.ca/news/7593419/bc-casinos-too-dangerous-cullen-commission/)
We all know where this illicit money is coming from, China. 
We all know that our kind and trusting nature is bring taken advantage of at every opportunity.
It's time to demand tough action on CCP agressions into our society.
Edit: spelling
More like the bureaucrats and politicians who knew get more time to shred evidence and cover-up.
Only $5 billion?
For context, New Brunswick had requested an exemption from the federal government’s 2030 phase-out of coal power plants, and yesterday the federal government rejected that request.  So now this is the response from NB’s premier.
I guess he figures wth Trudeau dishing out cash like its candy and Justin wanting to score points with the climate crowd he could ask for so much.
Just imagine if every coal plant costs $5 billion to shut down? We would get $5 billion in benefits from that?
If they rename themselves Bombardier or SNC Lavalin, they might just pull this off.
**"Energy poverty" of the Atlantic provinces...**
I rage when I read this from the NB Premier...
Not too long ago, Quebec [offered to buy NB Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_sale_of_NB_Power), debts and all,  for billions, a sum **that would have erased the province's public debt**.
Even better, Hydro-Quebec had promised to match the NB electricity rate to those in Quebec, the lowest in North-America.
On top of that, Hydro Quebec was going to take care of New Brunswick's [old nuclear power plant that is in dire need of upgrades](https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/cost-of-refurbishing-point-lepreau-nuclear-plant-could-be-3-3-billion-pmo-memo-1.1362644).
Hydro-Quebec would have canceled the need for coal in NB.
And New Brunswick would have had access to 100% renewable and green electricity, would have unloaded its costly nuclear power plant unto Quebec and would have paid the lowest electricity price in North-America...
**And the people of NB voted against that deal... Because "fuck the frogs".**
Now, NB wants **the rest of Canada to pay** for shutting down a coal mine after refusing a deal that would have made Quebec pay, at no cost to the rest of Canada...
**If NB had taken the Hydro-Quebec deal, it would not need to go beg the rest of Canada for $5 billion... The entire cost would have been on Quebec but now, all of Canada will have to pay.**
how is this any different than the maritime link already built, and why the heck would it cost so much just to turn something off
all of this just so the power doesn't transit Quebec? Muskrat falls is right next door to Churchill falls in case anyone wasn't aware
How can it cost $5 billion dollars to replace a single 467 MW coal power station?
That’s not a really big power station and could be replaced for $1 billion easily.  
What a scam they are trying to pull.
5 billion to shut down a plant 9 years from now. foh.
Better idea they use some of the money they saved not paying taxes.
Want to fight climate change? This is how you do it. Close down coal but it is going to cost money if they want it done more quickly.
Sounds like a deal. Let's do it. Pay for retraining and salaries for the workers who are displaced.
Don't do it Justin, it's all gonna go to Irving or worst to bill another nuclear reactor.
Why do I expect Higgs to use it to pay down the provincial debt?
> New Brunswick had requested an exemption from the federal government’s 2030 phase-out of coal power plants
They just asked for the same exemption NS already has. Seems like you can't treat provinces differently here. Although NS was given their exemption when the Liberals were in charge but NB had a PC government so they get fucked. That's just gross.
Alberta's shut down many in the last couple decades. Last I read, we only had 18 and 12 of them are reaching end of life and being converted to nat gas this decade. Where's our government grant for that LOL
Hydro Quebec doesn't like the Atlantic provinces. Newfoundland wasn't about to get screwed again like that did with lower Churchill.
You gotta build a better Transmission between NS and NB to get that Muskrat power. It would be great though because than NS could bring in HydroQuebec power. Probably cost about 5 Billion dollars though.
https://www.nspower.ca/about-us/electricity/delivering
Well Trudeau has been handing out cash like candy..
Higgs probably wants to invest it in SMRs.
They should shut down line 5 pipeline too!
None, because we refuse to tap into our nigh infinite resources, when we do the project *barely* gets off the ground before a bunch of woke NIMBYs kill it. 
Canada is easily one of the worst countries on the planet for the resource extraction business. Any company thinking they can profit off the EV boom by doing business here is an idiot and will be burned in short order.
Which company is stupid enough to invest in natural resource extraction and transportation in Canada
Canada could be a happening place for natural resources but the last decade has made me think it won’t happen.
Yeah, because it’s so easy to do resource extraction in Canada! We can’t even build a NG pipeline with overwhelming FN’s support in B.C. we let our whole transport system Canada wide be shut down by a handful of activists! Our roads get blocked weekly by the same activists in our major cities! I’m sure it inspires confidence in investors!
People want a green new future but are sticker shy when it comes down to actually mining and processing the materials for it.
Canada is a great place to invest in natural resources, especially if you like spending 10 years and billions of dollars in court fighting frivolous lawsuits before you can even break ground.  I mean who wouldn't jump at that opportunity.
Probably not much, there will be many who push to leave them in the ground.  It would take diesel fueled equipment to extract them.
As a geologist I’d say about zero. 
Germany, Japan, South Korea….raw material access is secondary. A mine in the Yukon Canada isn’t going to sell ore to a company in Ontario for less return than it can get from  a company in South Korea.
A company currently producing gold, nickel, zinc has international buyers. 
And, as mentioned. Investing in developing natural resources in Canada may now be too risky in our social structure.  Nobody is going to invest in long term mega projects just to have them never come to fruition.  No more major pipelines, nuclear plants, rail lines.
None, we will never be able to extract them and bring it to market. Thanks JT, hereditary (NON ELECTED) chiefs, unemployed arts majors, and people who have a pretty fat trust fund.
Not much because our govt will sell us out to the Oligarch families for a song
Selling minerals does not make much profits. End products do.
None because EV's represent 2% of the new vehicle market share and less than 1% of vehicles owned.
EV is a niche market of a niche market, it's going nowhere, and hype it all you want - nobody buys them.
As it seems we just give our resources away.. none?
CATs just released an electric dozer to go with its electric haul trucks and shovels. Time to strip mine, the green way.
None because its not nationalized then it’s just a give away to foreign entities who pay next to nothing for any of it while destroying the environment kind of like all of current resource extractment.
Great point. Canadians love the idea of critical minerals but don't seem as interested once they realize they involve, like, mining 'n stuff. The magic zero-impact resource extraction machine has yet to be invented.
I mean, Canada is in the top 10 for GDP created from mining, so it can't be that bad to do business here. 
I think the issue that these "NIMBY's" see have valid basis in what we've seen with Alberta's abandoned oil well crisis. Sure, every company has a plan to clean up their mess. That doesn't mean they do it. 
In Ontario, the Ring of Fire issue is just heating up, and I think it's a good thing to scrutinize a project of this magnitude, especially its impacts on already marginalized communities. 
This whole "dig, because it's there" mentality is something that needs to die with the oil industry.
> bunch of woke NIMBYs
That would be me. Fossil fuel should be left in the ground.
We gave China of all people something like a 30 year open license. We basically pay people to rape us.
Well you know that someone's great great great great great great grandfather once to a shit their so obviously the area is sacred and no development can happen.
Have they addressed any concerns related to any record breaking prices?
>But he has major concerns with how the commission is structured, including the fact that two of its three board members own dairy farms and the third has an extensive background in dairy processing
"Do you have any conflicts of interest to report?"
".......... No."
Quebec dairy farmers make up a large lobby force. Annoy them at your own risk.
Lets be real here unless its directly benefits  Justin Trudeau or his family's pockets he doesn't give a single F.
Downplaying and the LPC, what a fucking duo
I mean, what's a glass of milk anyway Michael? $10.00?
Record-breaking vote prices, I'd say.

Fuck these clowns
The liberals don't care about inflation lets be real.
Part of the plan.
That's one way to keep pushing the market to milk alternatives.
of course they do! They protect a monopoly that screws over Canadians[. Just think, yesterday they pretended to care about the cost of living.](https://financialpost.com/news/economy/canada-pm-trudeau-says-he-is-extremely-concerned-by-soaring-cost-of-living-2)
In Canada we have supply management.  The price and quantity of milk to be produced is set.  This is to make sure that the dairy farmers can make a sustainable profit to keep going and to reduce the amount of milk that is dumped.
In the US they give subsidies to their farmers to keep them competitive, but let them over produce and just throw out any excess.
So, take your pick.  Supply management where the user pays, or general subsidies where everyone pays?
>According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), American milk consumption dropped from 275 pounds per capita in 1975 to 149 pounds in 2017. Due to dwindling demand, US dairy farming operates at a substantial loss—in 2016, the national average was $10.16 net loss per hundred pounds of milk. However, New York and Vermont farmers lost $16.34 and $17.38 per hundred pounds, respectively. 
>American farmers dump millions of gallons of excess milk a year. In 2016, the American dairy industry drained 43 million gallons of excess milk in fields, animal feed, or anaerobic lagoons. In the shortsighted interest of keeping farms in business, the federal government purchases billions of dollars’ worth of excess milk, which is stored as cheese. As of 2019, the USDA has 1.4 billion pounds of surplus cheese.
>Heavy subsidy masks the industry’s lowered demand. One year after the passage of the Agricultural Act of 2014—which reformed commodity and crop insurance programs—the American government spent $24.7 billion in direct and indirect subsidies. Subsequently, the dairy industry received $43 billion in 2016 and $36.3 billion in 2017. In 2018, 42 percent of revenue for US dairy producers came from some kind of government support. 
https://www.nupoliticalreview.com/2020/05/16/my-beef-with-dairy-how-the-us-government-is-bailing-out-a-dying-industry/
Don’t NEED milk friends.
I have not purchased milk since 2012. I simply do not care.
Here's an idea. Don't buy milk.....
Jokes on you, I was already used to overpaying for milk due to a preference for non dairy alternatives.
The liberals aren't going to address any concerns lol. The country is mostly brain dead anyways 😂. You elect clowns, you get a circus.
"How much could a carton of milk cost?  $10?" 
- Justin Trudeau, probably
Love this show.
Since the auto industry is going to be ruined in Canada, the alternative can be glass blowing to top up real estate.
Joke’s on you. As if the millennials could afford homes in BC.
Should the real estate agent tell you that before you buy a home?
Insurance is a form of gambling that bets on odds that most people like to live near water won't soon be under water.
Insurance... The biggest scam in the world.  Pay through the nose and when you want to claim, they find a way to wiggle out. 
"Sir, you didn't use the required emoji at the end of your claim form.... **DENIED !!"** (ref Section 3, sub section 5, part 2a, para 6 sub para 4, sentence 4 just  after the semicolon, have a nice day ! ;) )
Nah you’ll get insured it’s just your claim(s) will be denied.
I'm seeing these articles pop up everywhere and yet it's still nearly impossible to find complete or understandable maps to determine which areas are in flood plains.
The upside is, your basement will be your swimming pool!
Jokes on you, Insurance company! I don't own a home.
No
Stay calm and build more pipelines
Even ones within flood ranges are going for 1 million+
We can. It's just that we don't want to live in northern BC.
Yes and no, though a good realtor will. however the last year has seen a lot of rules / sense of obligation go right out the window. 
That being said it is also something that is usually public record with the municipality which the house is in about where flood zones are. As well your insurance company will be able to tell you if they will insure the property. So it is also up to you to do the due diligence when buying.
You should find it out but I wouldn’t rely on someone who makes money based on you buying. The agents primary motivator is a sale- despite what they say their goal isn’t to protect you. It’s like relying on your real estate agent to do an inspection… you need to do that due diligence yourself.
If you're getting a mortgage, insurance is part of the process. If a home isn't insurable you wouldn't be able to get a mortgage, in most situations.
Also insurance companies are quite conservative in where they won't insure for flooding.
My house for example is 40 vertical meters from nominal water level in the river.  The biggest flood any evidence was found to have happened was 5 meters.
I was ok with that risk.  Even if the insurance company wouldn't insure my place for overland flooding because of the postal code my home resides in.  (Some of the code is down on the flood plain.)
> http://floodsmartcanada.ca/floodplain-maps/
You would think but just now out of curiosity I checked my area that I've lived in for years only to find I'm just barely out of the flood planes and had no idea. I doubt most people in my city have any idea of how much of the city would be underwater if it flooded.
Today is a good day for day drinking.
Shouldn’t matter - if you have financing as a condition, usually they require proof the home is insurable before they provide a financing letter. Also, the property disclosure statement should give a history of flooding and repairs
Should, but they won't so they can get another sale

Shocking. I wonder what country…
Every Canadian should read "Wilful Blindness" by Sam Cooper. I was beyond shocked and appalled by how badly Canada has sold out itself to international criminals. Fentanyl crisis and housing crisis brought to you by narcos and corrupt Canadian politicians and public servants.
Shocking absolutely no Canadians, this has been well known, our government just refuses to do anything about it.
People in B.C have known this has been happening for decades.  Best way to launder money is through Real estate.
Interestingly enough, China is also upset that the wealth of its citizens is leaving for Canadian real estate, because China wants that money to stay inside the country where they can control it.

This is an open secret and politicians and FIs keep ignoring it.
There's a reason why any housing stats on "foreign ownership" is low it's because they send their kids to study here and they don't count as foreign owner.
There are elected MPs who are profiting off this system, how can we expect any change?

Can we stop using the term "Canada" like we are in a cogent organized state.
We are a money laundering shithole for the uber wealthy and well on our way to Post state status, unfortunately.
I've said it before and I'll say it again: it should be required to be a Canadian citizen in order to own land in Canada.  Canada is for Canadians.
when i, an american citizen, moved to toronto to start a grad program, i went to TD to set up a bank account. he (edit: the TD banker) insisted that i neither declare any income, nor that i was from the US, nor give him my actual address at the time, so that he could approve my account quicker and bypass regulations (i didn't do that stuff obviously). i don't have millions, i have like $10k. this fraud is rampant, ubiquitous, and unacceptable
We are ruled by politicians, who are ruled by billionaires. Neither actually give a fuck about us. We’re here to build roads, conduct services, and pay taxes.
That is why I keep sayign that when someone immigrates, any money they bring or change into assets above a certain amount needs to be taxed as income. 
Oh, you're buying a $2 million house and only claimed $76 in income last year? Guess what, you're now paying income taxes, as well as provincial, etc, on it like it was a pay check.
This is a known thing amongst Canadians especially in Vancouver. My partner had a coworker from mainland China who came to study in Vancouver. Said friend would FaceTime with her father back in China while visiting properties to purchase once a month or so. She’d go to open houses and if he liked it would wire her the money to purchase. One time after purchasing it turned out a cemetery could be seen in the distance which is considered bad juju in their customs so they sold it soon after. The properties just sat as investments…no tenants. It’s only when the government implemented the empty home tax her father starting asking the kids to reside in some of the properties. 
We bought our little 1br shoebox place 5 years ago paying $1100/sq ft and things have just gotten worse since then. It’s so insane for two people to wfh in such a tiny space yet we consider ourselves lucky to at least own a home in this market.
China [burns 50.5%](https://www.worldometers.info/coal/coal-consumption-by-country/) of all world thermal coal consumption.
So you're not going to see coal use go down, or CO2 emissions decrease, for a long time yet.
Aren't companies scrambling to develop emission interception systems for coal plants? That was the whole 'clean coal' argument from a few years back.
If I recall correctly, the argument was that developing nations didn't have the economic power to pivot away from coal plants yet, and therefore the best way to reduce global emissions from coal was to adapt coal plants to scrub carbon from combustion emissions as close to the source as possible.
No clue what came out of that though, it never seemed to get popular.
Considering that developing places burn animal shit when they don't have coal, I don't think it holds that title.
Thank god Notley opened up that new coal mine by Hinton.
if they transition on time to something cleaner, we might have a chance . If it takes them too much time or if they dont.   we are fucked.
Coking coal, at any rate, isn't going anywhere until someone comes up with a better way to make steel.
Burn burn burn, burning ring of fire
Saskatchewan built one and it isn't cost effective.
It's almost as if she was a centrist the whole time
It’s almost as if the premier of a province still has to appease their constituents even if they vehemently oppose and despise their premier. 
I am curious how in the fuck that mine got built so quickly though?
I'd heard about some shit with this, so I decided to read what they actually did. For anyone wondering: Chapman's is paying for regular rapid tests for their unvaccinated employees rather than imposing a strict mandate. They then decided that since the company is paying for the tests at a cost of about $40/week per employee, they decided to give every vaccinated employee that they decided don't need to be tested a raise of $1/hour, which is $40/week, the equivalent cost to the tests they pay for.
I think it's a good middle ground to ensure that people aren't losing their jobs for their own decisions on this situation, but also ensuring that compensation is fair across their employees.
Anti-Vaxxers: "Boycott Chapmans!"  
Result: Small decline because they probably weren't their target demographic anyway and are complaining for the sake of complaining.
Everyone else: "Buy Chapmans!"  
Result: Surge in revenue from the people who are trying to counteract the negative publicity generated by the anti-vaxxers.
Anti vaxxers cannot wrap their head around that they are a loud minority. They are not the majority that they think they are and any boycotts they call for, are met with increased sales. they boycotts do not work and their calls for them do not work.
That sublime two-litre brick of ice cream is a staple of my childhood.
Buying some after work today, good on you Chapmans!
I don't always eat Ice Cream.
But when I do I prefer Chapman's.
It's almost like 90% is more people than 10% isn't it.
so tired of hearing about anti-vaxxers. omg someone wants to put a needle in their own body....it's a vaccine that can potentially save your life. oh noes. I 've been double vaxxed for almost 8 months and feel fine. these anti vaxxers just need to shut up already
I am lactose intolerant, and hadn't bought (or even looked at) ice cream in years. It was recently brought to my attention that Chapman's does sell lactose-free, and mentioned that sorbets don't use milk.
The comments from the 'vocal minority' i've seen recently about Chapmans meant i'd buy it even if just 'because'. When I was at No Frills today it was really noticeable that while they were fully stocked on Breyers, NoName, and other brands, the Chapman's section had very little left.
I bought 2L of 'Mango Sorbet'.
Would appear i'm not the only person that's bought their product recently as a show of support.
I'm pleasantly *not* surprised.
BTW well done Chapman's.
I've always been a big fan. This won't change my behavior, because I already buy from them. It really makes me respect them though. I know that I wouldn't be so kind to the unvaccinated.
Just picked up two today. Thanks for everything Chapmans. Wish I could work for you, you certainly are one of the greatest companies in today’s world. Serious respect from my family to all of yours.
One more reason to reach for Chapman’s which is right next to Nestle’s. #boycottnestles
[Saw it coming the instant that news was posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/qzw358/antivaccine_groups_boycotting_chapmans_ice_cream/hlp6o2b?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)
I sent a short msg to them via their web contact form offering my support, FWIW. Their P.R. mgr responded and thanked me, said it makes it all worth it when they hear positive feedback.  Chapman's needs to know we \*are\* on their side, most of us.
Chapman's is one of the biggest employers in my mum's hometown. Got lots of family members who worked there, and the company's donated several million dollars to save the local elementary school. Thank you, Chapman's, for the kindness you've shown toward your community and your willingness to encourage your employees to get their vaccine!
I bought some of their ice cream sandwiches as a direct result of hearing these anti-vaxxers were wanting to boycott them.
I don't even buy ice cream regularly! It was a treat! Both deliciously and spiting these gross anti-science people!
lol I miss the days when I didn't know the political stances of ice cream companies.
Bought some the other day, going to buy more today :).
I buy their ice cream and will continue to do so.
Psilocybin helped me quit an 18 year nicotine habit 
Ibogaine helped me kick a 10 year heroin habit 
3-HO-PCP helps me deal with backburnering
I ended a 6 year long opiate addiction, in the last year was fent watched my friends die around me. DMT and ayahuasca over the course of a month and I quit. No soboxone, no methadone, no nothing. I can say unequivocally that any side effect from psychedelics far out weighs waking up with your best friend dead on the couch sitting next to you.
The problem is they won't fix the underlying problems in society that cause our mental health issues. 
But we weren't doing that anyway so fuck it and give me some drugs.
Already seeing Oregon working towards legalization of psilocybin for therapeutic use, and voting to decriminalize in a handful of cities in the US (ie. Oakland, Ann Arbor, Denver). Calgary has a clinic operating under section 56 exemption for terminally ill patients (ATMA Journey).
MDMA is in phase 3 trials for treating PTSD, legal ketamine clinics already in the US. Early stage trials for psilocybin.
More acknowledgement of use in the mainstream - Mike Tyson, Dan Carcillo, Kristen Bell. 
There may be pitfalls, but what treatment doesn't. I have reservations about recreational use, but there is a legal path towards medical legalization in Canada and the US.

Psychedelics are like skydiving, they can be an exhilarating life enhancing experience, or without proper preparation and setting, a terrible, traumatic one. Set and setting are critical, and most importantly one must be comfortable with being out of control of ones senses, for some people this is just terrifying.
Psilocybin treats the migraines that incapacitate me 3-4 days a month, and got me off of antidepressants too. Its basically magic.
My fear is people take this to mean it’s safe to self medicate with psychedelics - which can lead to very serious side effects. I believe it could have good use if highly controlled, and properly prescribed - but it’s risky
I hope people dont take it as a green light to go trippin.
The ER sees too many of these bad trips. Some people never seem to "return" from their bad trips and it impacts them some way for the rest of their lives.
Playing with your brain chemistry is not fun and games. I commend people for expirimenting with frying their brains but its something I never had the courage to do.
Baby steps to a better you.
What is back burning?
Well put.
It helps put things in a different perspective and can change someone's outlook. These aren't like many other drugs where once you stop taking them the benefit is lost.
That has been the policy since the sixties.
How do you consume them? Your body needs a week to recharge after your first trip.
Legality has nothing to do with how many people take them.  Besides why on earth would someone struggling pay hundreds of dollars for something can costs pennies to grow.
Psilocybin will mess you up if you’re predisposed to having schizophrenia and a handful of other disorders. It may be helpful in a  psychiatric setting. But assuming it’s safe to legalize recreational usage it is not.
Sorry, meant backburnering*
There is no trip. Microdosing means you don't get high. I use a coffee grinder to grind them up and then I cap them in gel caps. You'll want to weigh them or just half fill the capsules if they're larger. When I get the sense that a migraine is starting, I pop a capsule and go about my day. I usually take a few periodically throughout the day for a the usual 3 day duration (my migraines are hormonally triggered and therefore predictable). No more laying in a quiet dark room with my eyes closed for one weekend a month. Its been life changing.
My concern comes from approval being seen as an across the board endorsement, and self medicating on mundane things is dangerous enough - even if you grow it yourself I’d still want a professional to be helping determine dose and frequency. 
Psychedelics are not something to fuck around with unless you’re ready for the potentially life altering side effects that can come from one bad trip.
Ah, I should have realized that. Thanks. And well done.

I'm sorry, 'raiding Wet’suwet’en territory'? you mean removing protesters the Wet'suwet'en don't actually want there? real shit take there beaverton.
Pretty sure this was reported on CBC radio 1 every hour today.
They are not exempt from federal law enforcement.
You mean arresting terrorists holding hostages without access to food and water?
They are not on fire with this.
Beaverton fail.
Yeah, the news is lacking or one-sided.  Deal with it guys. Not a new issue and it isn't the time to be in denial about shitty race relations in our country.
Many idiots read headlines,  fuck ppl are dumb . It's satire you angry fools . God damn ppl are stupid....
The beaverton is like the onion now...these headlines could almost be true...or are and we cant admit it out loud.
Spot on headline, Beaverton.
The Beaverton better be careful with this “writing about anti pipeline protesters as though they are human” thing.
Canadians hate nothing more, it seems, then passionate engaged youth fighting overtly harmful unsustainable projects.
Everyone will clap for the jobs when this protest is done but it won’t end protests. It just inches us towards further disasters.
But hey, fuck our country right. The protesters don’t deserve to care about and neither do I. The absolute will of corporations is all that matters and all that will continue to matter.
One more example of the obvious bias that exists at Beaverton.
Straight garbage
I know, very misleading
I think most of the people removed *were* Wet'suet'en.
Haha the wetsuwetan is a homogenous body that always agrees with you I’m sure.
The protesters are there with the support of many wetsuwetan and you can’t erase their experience because you’re bitter the world isn’t more civil. Expect it to get less civil as these self defeating projects escalate as they always do.
People will cheer cheer cheer for the RCMP breaking up these protests and still cry when the environmental impacts cause wanton damage to the area. 
Reality is the protesters are just as Wet’suwet’en and just as valid in their belief and identity as pro pipeline First Nations. 
It’s just inconvenient for people but of course it was going to come to this and it will come to it again. How long can we hoorah the RCMP for violently ensuring that my province will have more climate disaster?
shhh that doesnt fit the narrative.
They Also don’t represent the Wet’suwet’en
They can leave at literally any time.
Congrats, you figured out what satire is.

As a woman, I don't really like this. Of course we need lots of/more women in politics but this  is not the way to go about it imo. Smacks of tokenism to me.
I literally thought this was a Beaverton headline
Way to exclude half of the population in the name of inclusiveness. Another well thought out policy by the left.
"Boosting gender parity" by banning one gender.
Whatever happened to running the *best candidate* ?
LOL. Choosing candidates based on the declared shape of their genitals.
"Ontario Liberals concede June 2022 election in November 2021"
More toxic and divisive identity politics.
I get the point, but it’s shooting yourself in the foot. It inherently disqualifies potentially more qualified and better candidates. Bad move.
What if someone identified as a woman but wasn’t genetically a woman?
Looks like I'm going to be contacting my representatives. Enough with the sexism.
So about half of the population is not allowed to vote? How is this democracy?
Good to know that liberals are actively trying to lose with this woke culture bullshit
Ford absolutely deserves a 2nd term
Democracy! Oh, wait!
Hey Dougie is looking pretty weak now, would be a shame if BLATENT SEXISM costs you otherwise winnable seats!
Welcome to Apartheid, yet again…
Liberals- the absolute masters of divisive politics.
This is one more step towards communism.
Equity aka equality of outcome is evil and people need to call it out and crush it when the degenerates push it.
How about students are given a choice on whether they like online vs classroom. 
I am a comp sci grad. I did my 3 year college diploma in person then my BSc and MSc online. 
I did online education before Covid. 
Being online enabled me to finish my education while continuing to work. No having to pay for parking, no having to schedule my life around classes, I didn’t have to put my life on hold to continue my education. I was able to move to where the jobs were without having my schooling tie me down to a location. 
I understand everyone learns differently and not every program can be done online, but for the programs that can, students should be given the option
I really miss in-class learning, and feel that the quality of education is much poorer at the university level for sure, and can't even imagine the damage that is done by keeping children home from school.
My academic friend has been calling Winter 22 the semester of reckoning for students. There's literally students that have done 2 straight years online and cheated and once back in person there ain't gonna be any mercy.
How about they pay for the parking and I'll consider it.
Universities are probably sweating hard not having students filling up residence and using the on campus food services.
Pre covid more and more programs were made available online. The point is to give students options.
Yeah most people I know have either dropped out or put off enrollment indefinitely. Really depressing.
It's just like they say: cheaters never prosper.
its not even cheating, teachers ( at least in my college) made every test open book since it was online and nothing could be done. I'm more worried that going back into class there will be a complete change and the way people have been doing things for close to 2 years now will be changed back.
Is there really anything wrong with this method considering I'm 17 years into a career (Business Law) and I have access to more information than ever would been available during my studies?  
Being able to research is far more valuable than being able to retain information from my perspective (again, an observation made after 17 years of working experience).

If he's a criminal throw him out!
If I'm the immigration minister, I allow him to stay, but within the confines of the accepted traditional territory.  He cannot pursue employment outside of traditional boundaries, in Canada. If he is traveling for work outside of traditional boundaries, then he has to apply for a travel permit, and his permit will be evaluated according to established Canadian Immigration rules. He may also travel for healthcare reasons as well, but is responsible for costs of treatment, either through insurance or by going back to Alaska.  
I think this approach respects his cultural heritage, but doesn't encourage "back doors" for suspect entrants.  Also, if he's way up North, I highly doubt he'll be able to have a grossly negative impact on Canadians.  At the end of the day, he's spending most of his time in extremely, otherwise inhospitable areas.  His actions are unlikely to pose a threat to Canadians in general.  It'll be his community he'll be hurting, if he reverts to his old, negative habits.  Good for him for turning his life around and making it better.
ISTM that this is prohibited. First Nations people can't be bound by borders.

It has more mutations, but how many people have died from it? South Africa has 20% HIV rate for adults under 65. That's a lot of immunocompromised and very low vaccination rate.
Yawn, change the channel, this shows gotten so repetitive, like how many more bad guys can they make
Who cares, what I really want to hear about is how Chapman's Ice Cream sales are doing.
I’m not buying this crap. It was so predictable before Christmas. If it was really contagious and transmissible we would have more then 8 fucking cases with Africa on a huge wave. Search the African chart please. Only 1k cases.
The southern American border has a lot of caravans entering the United States. Which leads me to believe Covid  variant isn’t much of a threat. Why not close borders between Mexico and United States if they know it’s a bad strain within the pandemic.
At this point if you buy into the media you are the problem.
It's already here. Only a matter of time before we detect it, but it's already here.
I 👏 don't 👏 give 👏 a 👏 flying 👏 fuck! I'm fully vaccinated and I don't care anymore. The virus is here to stay. It will mutate and there will be variants. It doesn't necessarily mean that it'll be more dangerous.
This thread should be fun
Obligatory "Why does Ross, the largest friend, not simply eat the other friends?" comment
South Africa has one of the best testing & sequencing infrastructures in the world and is a hub for epidemiology, so the fact that they're the ones finding this insane exponential growth means it's also happening in lots of other countries at this exact moment without anyone measuring it.
Just like how nobody was prepared for Delta because all of their expectations and protocol was based off on Alpha, nobody is prepared for Omicron since they're all basing their expectations on Delta.
32 mutations
most of them in the spike (what vaccines target)
shares ~20 mutations with the worst variant a lab could cook up to study the impact of vaccines on bad future variants. result: bad lab variant fully escaped vaccines and antibodies
the person that popped omicron positive in israel was triple pfizer vaccinated
both HK cases are fully mRNA vaxxed
omicron don't fucking care
The most important thing is that we take no action until peer reviewed studies are available.
Google 'South Africa covid' and check out the steep incline on that curve!
It's already here... In my nightmares
How much more or less fatal it is is what's pertinent. If new mutations are trending towards milder and less deadly results, then we're on the road to governments declaring covid an endemic and taking actual steps towards reopening and normalcy.
We better shut everything down and bring back CERB or turn CERB into UBI. Lets go!
Article Highlights:
* It's "only a matter of time" before cases of the new Omicron COVID-19 variant are detected in Canada, according to the medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.
* Dr. William Schaffner says travel bans, such as the one implemented by Canada against southern states in Africa, can help delay the spread of the new strain but that it will eventually make its way around the globe.
* "By that time, it's hopeful that we'll learn a lot more about these variants that will help us cope," he told CTV News Channel on Friday. "Anything that can dampen down introductions, slow the spread of this new variant around the world is important."
* "No border is completely porous-free. These things can travel, and that's a problem," Omar Khan, professor of biomedical engineering and immunology at the University of Toronto, told CTV News Channel on Friday. "It was recently detected, that does not mean it recently emerged. So that's the concern."
* Kahn says “We were extremely fortunate that it worked for Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta. Now, with Omicron, time will tell if we will still have protection.  "It's a moving target. The vaccine stays the same and the virus is evolving. So that's the challenge."
Are vaccines ineffective against it?
I’m waiting to hear about the megatron variant. They said evidence shows the vaccine is effective against this weeks new news about the same old news of the last two years….. /yawn
Already here
But of a setback for sure, but I still have faith (through science) that we can return to new normal within the next 5-10 years.
So vaccines are ineffective against it, which is unsurprising considering all the spike mutations, but what about those with hybrid immunity? They've got both the vaccine immunity to the spike protein, and also naturally acquired immunity to the whole virus. Any indication on how the inactivated virus vaccines are doing against this variant?
>The Ford government opted against pursuing approximately $1-billion in penalties from the owner of the 407 Express Toll Route when traffic levels fell below a contractual target during the pandemic.
I'm not really seeing the scandal here. 
During that same period, the CRA waived all interest and late penalties on corporate and personal income tax filings because...and here's the thing to remember...IT WAS A FUCKING LOCKDOWN AND PEOPLE WERE TOLD TO STAY HOME.
There was less traffic on that highway because of government mandates.
Alternate Title: Ontario Government didn’t choose to penalize the 407, primarily owned by the Canada Pension Plan, due to declines in traffic due to COVID.
r/Ontario:
Oh my God!  Doug Ford is a MONSTER!  He's in collusion with the owners of the 407, getting kickbacks for not pursuing the penalty!  He should pursue this and use the money on social programs!  
Reality:
The 407 had lighter traffic solely due to COVID lockdowns.  Pursuing the penalty would most likely fail.
Toll roads and bridges should be eradicated.
Interesting context: the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) controls a 50.01% stake in Highway 407.
[https://www.cppinvestments.com/public-media/headlines/2019/cppib-increases-investment-407-international-inc](https://www.cppinvestments.com/public-media/headlines/2019/cppib-increases-investment-407-international-inc)
Government should not build a new highway, rather purchase the 407 and make it toll free. We can set off the purchase price by, I dunno, $1 Billion.
Rule of Acquisition 17, A contract is a contract is a contract... but only between Ferengi
Paywalled.  Can someone please tell us if we should be angry about this?
Guess friends don’t sue friends!  More money that could have gone to making schools safer or paying HCW’s a living wage?
Interesting coming from my buds Fourd
yeah, how would that look in court? we are punishing you because traffic was below a threshold we set and due to us telling people not to work or travel.. seems like it would have been a waste of money and time.
Trucks were still moving around and stayed away from 407 because it costs $100s to drive across it.
There were still people on the road. 407 did absolutely nothing to maintain some traffic. Had they dropped prices and witnessed barely any traffic changes, then they would have a leg to stand on. 
The minimum traffic clause was in the contract. The same contract that stated that the province has no control over the toll prices. If the contract is going to be enforced to benefit 407, then it should for tax payers.
According to r/Ontario, this is corruption at it's finest, with Ford family getting kickbacks for not pursuing this.
Ford bad!
Imagine the world if the media would simply frame things realistically.
Does the CPP have a majority stake in the 407? TIL
Also I believe there was a clause in the contract that stated they weren't even allowed to punish them under these circumstances? Unless I'm misunderstanding.
The people on that subreddit are actually mentally deranged.  Even the Toronto subreddit is more balanced.
Who gives a hoot what their problems are - You think they would care if I said I didn't have any money for them this week because COVID closed my business down?  Or if the 401 became unuseable for some reason and the 407 got super busy do you think the people running the 407 would give the new users a break on tolls?  Of course not.   
We want our money or sell us back the highway..
Crossing the 407 costs over $50 (and higher depending on the vehicle type). Maintaining that toll structure when there were fewer cars on the road with a minimum traffic obligation was 407's attempt at profit maximization with little regard for contractual obligation.
The same contract that allowed them to raise tolls to the levels they are at right now with no input from the province.
Ahhh yes, /r/Canada itself is truly the bastion of the intelligent.
Iv been keeping up with this budget because I'm a glutton for punishment and have nothing better to do. This council is going to be A DISASTER.
What's not included in the tax increase is that the council also approved 50M in grants to downtown developers to retrofit their offices. This 50M is coming out of reserve funds because it would have literally doubled the tax rate.
For those of you who don't know Jyoti (the new mayor) had literally one of the highest developer funded campaigns. Instead of prioritizing Calgarians who are about to go through a really difficult time, she decided its better to give money to her developer buddies.
There was A LOT of horseshit during this council meeting. The veterans of council who had agendas used climate change as an excuse to not debate items
https://twitter.com/LiveWire_DK/status/1463585009332224000?t=PQABUI_QuNxNnzeJ6PiyBg&s=19
>Coun. Chabot wants the items split. He said he's not sure he can support 4A or 4D (4A includes the 19 FTEs), but would approve the other expenses. 
>Coun. Carra said right now, with a climate emergency declared, "If we don't put our money where our mouth is.... we're being performative."
After council realized that the tax increase had reached 4% they suspended procedure and quickly voted to approve the entire budget instead of the typical way they do it because they knew that if they went home that night they would have been torn apart overnight. So they pushed it right through and killed any debate or potential response.
I tried giving Jyoti the benefit of the doubt. But she's treating Calgarians like complete idiots. Here she is literally threatening to cut off a councillor's mic when he brings up that prior councillors spoke about defunding the police
https://twitter.com/meksmith/status/1463244943586054147?t=NYPw9NOjcRpTAB9XEhZW6g&s=19
Council absolutely did initially vote to defund the police and that conversation did take place.

I miss Nenshi, I disagreed with him on a bunch of stuff, but he was NEVER so callous in his BS his first 30 days on the job. How this council is allowing a mayor to threaten councilors like that is outright scary.
Just what she ran on in the recent election,  right?!  I mean this is exactly what surging inflation calls for from the hard pressed taxpayer as the family budget gets tighter and tighter: higher taxes.
My city does this just about every other year.
Don’t forget that if you voted otherwise, you were labeled a racist!
People voted for this?
I'm not a Calgarian but I understand the city took a massive hit to its revenues with all the downtown office closures. Where else are they going to get the money? If they province gives it to them, you'll pay for it out of your provincial taxes anyways.
Elect lefties and find out.
City has to fund their defined benefits pensions somehow. Socialism is here, enjoy mediocrity!

Everyone thank “Calgary’s future” a collection of cupe union workers in Calgary who spent MILLIONS more than the next third party advertiser to make sure nothing was done about the bloat at city council. 
They endorsed gondek right before the election and she caved and took their money. Now there is no one to hold this council to account. 
We are f’d.
Yikes.
The effective tax increase is really about 7%, which is what it has run at every year (more or less) for the past 11 years or so.  Make no mistake this new Council will NOT reign in spending.
The 14 new communities being built out over the next 20 years have guaranteed an annual increase in the operating budget over that period.  Throw on the pet projects and virtue signaling and climate emergency and property taxes will double again by 2031.
Sean Chu molested a minor. His mic should just be disconnected.

45% of all money that exists Canada wide today was printed in the last 2 years.
A tax hike is how you make every Canadian resident pay for the entirety of it. Only the working class will feel it though.
Inflation affects government spending too.

1st thing in office hurt our economy.
2nd thing raise taxes 
Great leadership.
* until the election year wherein suddenly all councillors turn into fiscal Conservatives.
Even better. A racist misogynist. The amount of brain dead morons I met talking about how great it will be to have a minority woman as mayor was ridiculous. Like yea, I guess policies don’t matter cause she’s a woman of colour. ID pol is a disaster.
This election was easily swayed by a union PAC that raised millions of dollars before new municipal election rules kicked in. This allowed them to outspend every single other candidate by multiples.
Millions being spent on an election is unheard of for Calgary. A single PAC spending that much is about to set off a new arms race in PAC funding.
How successful was this PAC? 9 of 13 candidates they supported and funded were elected. Essentially, our council now works for the union.
Union representation in councils is a great thing. Unions having complete control over a council is a horrible thing. There needs to be some type of balance.

Well we tried our best but this isn't going away, time to get on with our lives and let nature take its course.
https://globalnews.ca/news/8404184/explainer-covid-variant-south-africa/
“South African experts said there are no indications to date that the variant causes more severe or unusual disease and noted that as with other variants, some infected people don’t have any symptoms.”
Let’s not get wound up over something that we don’t have the answers to just yet!
But what are the hospitalisation rates... This is all that should matter at some point
..
All we look at now is cases cases cases. When you hyperfocus on one thing, you are going to find things. If we meticulously examined every person for every health condition, comorbidities would skyrocket.
COVID is seasonal, live with it.
Wait until the inviso23 and magiko16 variants show up why it'll ... it'll, well it'll be something! I promise. Just extend the emergency powers and trust me.
There goes the media again insisting that vaccines don't work and calling for another 2 more years of lockdown.
so..... how're these vaccines workin out?
You ain’t seen nothing yet.
[removed]
If this new South African variant is really what they say it is, we're in for more shit folks. *There is concern that because it has so many mutations, that it will have the ~~ability~~ potential to evade vaccination / prior infection defence because of changes to the spike protein, potentially putting us back at square one.
Estimates put the covid death toll at between 5-20 million worldwide so far. If we're back to square one with zero protection for the elderly / at risk (including healthcare workers) who are vaxxed, expect that number to climb higher and faster.
*edit
https://youtu.be/jwDMI0nOnAY?t=123
That my opinion too. Average age of death in Canada pre covid... 83. Covid average... 85
The vaxxed have already gotten on with their lives.
My thoughts exactly every time I read these kinds of headlines. Idgaf about case counts right now. We could have 40,000 new cases a day and it wouldn't be scary if hospitals are good.
You mean Marek’s disease? The one that was made worse by mass vaccination with a leaky vaccine?
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/tthis-chicken-vaccine-makes-virus-dangerous
The problem is that the world needs to work together to eradicate it. Unlike the ‘Spanish Flu’ the world is so much more interconnected now, with low vaccinations in large parts of the world, mutations will always out-pace our ability to combat it.
lol
Nobody has said it evades vaccinations. They're saying there's a possibility, as there is with any new variant. They're looking into it.
Lol they said that for the delta and look it ended up not being as worse as they expected to. It hit India hard the USA did experienced higher case load and so did Europe but this is before the vaccine and the deaths were lower per cases. As soon as the vaccine was made covid started to not have as many waves and are lasting in shorter lengths this is with delta plus. I can see another wave but here were i live our peak in the whole thing was 4000 cases in Ontario. Because of vaccines i see it mabey hitting only 1500 to 2000 then start to drop. Plus kids are getting vaccinated.
https://www.newsbreak.com/news/2446270591664/south-african-medical-association-says-omicron-variant-causes-mild-disease?noAds=1&_f=app_share&s=i16 🤷‍♂️
This is very clearly a feature and not a bug.
The current government has a stated policy of record immigration to suppress wages - to keep business competitive- and doesn’t give a toss about the cost of living.
The pending inflation was a big reason why they wanted an election in the first place- to secure a majority before the inflation chickens came home to roost. 
Canada’s M1 money supply has gone from 900 billion  in December 2016  to 1.1 trillion in December 2019 to 1.6 trillion in August 2021.  That kind of money supply expansion that fast is going to come with inflation.  Period. Full stop.
For reference https://tradingeconomics.com/canada/money-supply-m1
Don't forget Temporary Foreign Workers** who are brought in on a temp visa to get work done at half price (in my industry). 
No disrespect to these honest folks. It is entirely our politicians' fault.
Multinational companies are also now exporting skilled services internationally (internal accounting, IT) to increase their competitiveness, further suppressing wages. 
"Compete internationally, live locally" is one of the main reasons behind wage suppression in our economy imo. 
We have supply chain management to protect prices for eggs and milk nationally. Now we need similar protection for manufacturing of other goods and services.
>In the U.S., which has orchestrated a sharp drop in immigration, the labour-market dilemma is the inverse: Workers are scoring the biggest pay hikes in decades — *nearly matching soaring inflation*
***nearly***. Jesus Christ. Pay people a living fucking wage. Match inflation or do better. We've been subsidizing massive profits with cheap labour for a generation now.
My kids are never moving out, are they...
What's stagnating growth are vicious companies like TELUS undermining the workers Union at every step while maintaining an "innocent face" to the public eye only because they are the lesser of the four evils of Telecom in Canada.
In reality, they have been negotiating in bad faith over  the past decade and base salaries have actually decreased, while thousands of jobs have been shipped to the Philippines because they can pay pennies for salary over there and labour laws don't apply so for example Telus Guatemala employees lose their extra hours bonus if they have a single 3/5 survey review. (Those you are asked to complete after calling or chatting). They must have all scores 4 or 5/5.
You would imagine such "socially responsible Canadian company" would hold themselves to high standards... no, they get millions in tax write-off for running cancer marathons but their own employees are forced to have evilcorp #1 (MANULIFE) as their insurance providers. Don't get me started on them.
Not to say the billions of dollars in handouts that the government has given them to develop infrastructure  for rural Canada while giving themselves huge executive bonuses every year, most of whom by the way are big oil and big coal names such as
Dick Aichinleck (25+ years in oil and gas)
Or 
Raymond T. Chan (40 years in oil and gas)
What immigrant will come here and stay here at these housing prices?
Supply and demand at it's simplest. I appreciate that immigrants tend to be more willing to do lower paid jobs and in the long run are likely to stimulate growth which benefits everyone, but in the here-and-now increasing the supply of labour relative to the demand for labour is going to have a negative impact on wage growth. I just wish the Canadian government would do more to resolve the housing shortage, as increasing the cost of rent or a down-payment for a house while wage growth is suppressed is a grim combination.
And yet, when anyone right-of-center has pointed this out, they're shouted down as racists.
Which means the current immigrants here get screwed as well and lose wage pressure. One day this racket will just lead to Canada becoming a revolving door of people leaving and entering.
You can't say that immigrants will stay here forever for QOL reasons, as the living standard is increasing globally, and countries such as Nigeria and India are building modern cities and infrastructure, just give it 3 decades. 
That's why I believe that 100 million population thing is extremely unrealistic no matter how hard they try. There will be other great places to live as things advance decade by decade.
I do hope the status quo will take their duties seriously eventually. Tired of seeing Canada waste so much potential.
Wait, what?
Isn't it just a few weeks ago they these folks where decrying the labour shortage and desperate to find workers? 
Darn NP/FP, can't get their stories straight.
How about unions and strike actions? Maybe if we looked out for one another and actually did things instead of crying that the government doesn’t do enough to look out for us. Like, Deere employees got a decent deal with their labour actions, so why are we so focused on in fighting with other workers when we should be working together?
Fuck you Financial Post! How dare the peons ask for a raise.
As a white person I've experienced racism 3 times i the last year all from recently landed immigrants or minorities. 
So the cultural differences are also inflating creating tension with personal views.
So for these reasons I noticed companies tend to hire a lot of their own people or for their religious beliefs.
[deleted]
We’re all replaceable parts i guess. someone still has to pay for that billionaire’s 9th home and those politicians’ vacation expenses
I'm very pro-immigration but I have to admit there's a reason why we're more and more dependent on them for growth. Even after "doing everything right", people can't afford to have kids anymore.
I'm not saying we should close off the borders and stop taking in refugees, but we absolutely need to get our shit together before we let more people in to a system that's impossible to get ahead in unless you're already wealthy. Housing and food prices getting crazy are a newish development but the writing has been on the wall for years. 
We've reached a breaking point and now young adults need to leave their hometowns or even the country to seek better lives again. We've regressed so far and the government refuses to do anything about it.
The central claim, that high immigration is primarily responsible for lagging wage growth, is taken entirely for granted. That is a massive claim without even the pretence of substantiating itself. But the grift doubles down when it also presents-- again, without a hint of evidence-- the wild insinuation that union participation and safety nets also depress the wages. 
I get that this is a conservative piece posted by a conservative user. I don't get why we have to have such little self-respect that this passes muster.
Well at least housing is cheap...
It’s so refreshing that we’re finally starting to be allowed to talk about the downsides of immigration and reducing it
Whoa.... who would have thought that continuing to import people who are willing to work for less when the regular person is already facing a hard time finding a good job will undercut wages?
If only there were somebody in a position of power to do something about this
"Extremely concerned" is code for we'll talk about it but do nothing to actually help the ppl struggling.
Extremely concerned by soaring cost of living that doesn't affect him or the Laurentian elite in the slightest.
*Right.*
Lol just not concerned enough to actually do anything. If he gave even an ounce of a shit he would have started trying to fix these problems *literally any time* in the last 6 years while he's been in charge.
No he isn't, otherwise we wouldn't have 25% of our homes owned by investors, we wouldnt have sky rocketing inflation, we wouldn't have a job market so flooded with immigrants that inflation will never be offset by wages increasing because job demand dies, and it all happened during the pandemic, where they didn't stop a single flight coming in from India, but bet your ass you had to stay home, fuck Trudeau and whatever he pretends to care about, it certainly isn't you
I'm shocked he even was aware the cost of living is rising
He was born rich, he doesn't understand the concept of "cost of living"
Prints 25% of all Canadian dollars ever made in 1 year. Cost of living goes up. Surprised Pikachu face.
Edit: sorry 45%
If Trudeau was concerned he would have stopped foreign investors buying out houses that no one uses since the start of 2020.
The costs will only increase due to inflation. More people will be put in poverty because they can’t afford   to pay for living expenses.
Trudeau should be focused on government policies that will help to create good paying jobs in Canada. China is already the wealthiest country in the world thanks to exporting jobs and businesses to China. Canada is becoming a poor country where the population is only in debt.
I'm physically disabled and know this is BS...We are STARVING TO DEATH but this gov't doesn't care.Yesterday a buddy dropped by and he hadn't eaten in 3 days.I only have food of any type left for 2 days but gave him 1/2..His disability is one thats mental and he's slowly dying of cancer.I told him not to worry about dying from cancer because he will have long since starved to death by then.What a fucked up nation Canada is allowing this to occur.Thx for listening I needed to vent
Crocodile tears
The guy who grew up with multi millionaire parents doesn't give a shit about you or the cost of living.
So bringing in extra immigrants to help keep wages depressed is how you respond.  Vote buying for you next election failure.
This kind of reminds me of the kid who wants to give everyone a million dollars so everyone is rich. 
But economics doesn’t work that way when you give everyone money then they are all as wealthy as they would have been with no gift. 
Canada can’t just keep printing money and giving it away because it erodes the wealth and incomes of everyone. It’s an invisible tax on every Canadian.
The problem is people love a cheque in the Mail but don’t even realize their now 5% poorer.
The guy has never had to make his own mortgage payment in his life.  He somehow has a net worth of 5 million despite having his first fulltime job in his 40's.
"Man this has me really upset! Better head to Tofino to clear my head a little..." - Trudeau, probably
Lol sure he is.
When do we get to see the photo op of him kneeling around homeless Canadians like he gives a fuck... how the hell this clown got voted in AGAIN is madness.
Economy in a downturn. STIMULUS! Economy is looking great. STIMULUS! Pandemic shuts down the economy. STIMULUS!
Call me crazy, but if JT does anything about inflation rates, I'm pretty sure it's gonna be STIMULUS!!
This is so sad.

I’m so tired of asking people to repeat themselves. Masks on, behind glass, I wear hearing aids. Ugh.
[deleted]
We’ve known this for months and nothings changed. Businesses are too afraid of any potential reprimand/backlash because they’ve been put through the fucking ringer the last 20 months that’s they’ll just leave em up indefinitely.
They are as effective as the ridiculous arrows.
The body of the article does not match the headline
The whole thing was security theatre foisted on companies by government officials trying to look like they were doing something and naturally the panicking public bought it hook line and sinker. 
What drives me bonkers though is that all adults today lived through 9/11. We have seen this all before and we learned god damned nothing.
"experts"
IIRC there’s evidence that plexiglass is a negative due to the way it disrupts airflow.
Security Theatre.
Speaking of air flow, isn't it crazy that so many buildings don't even have windows that can be opened?
Plexiglass isn't a magic bullet? Got it. Whoda thunk that containing a virus isn't about 1 single step, but a series of measures, when combined, deliver a desired outcome? 
I.e. plexiglass+mask+vaccine+proper ventilation = minimal risk. 
It's almost like going outside in an Edmonton winter requires different layers- Shock horror!?. 
Under shirt, preferably cotton, then an over shirt, hoodie, and windproofer = toastie.  
All the measures have been about mitigating risks and reducing risks.  But someone will use this and say, "hey why bother doing all these measures?"
Well, here's a question, let's just open the borders and let everyone in, and we'll figure it out. No? Why? Because while we can't stop every bad person from entering the country we can reduce the likelihood, means and opportunities for bad people to ruin this country.
Too many experts?
lmaooo they removed the post about the new South Africa variant because it doesn't apply to Canada, it will lol
Anti-vaxers hate plexiglass
I have hearing aids too :( I pointed out the other day that it makes wearing masks a pain and got downvoted into oblivion.
Deaf / Hoh people have been absolutely disregarded in all of this. The country has become so inaccessible.
I didn't realise how much I relied on lip reading to supplement my hearing loss until 2020. Now all I've got is eyes, posture and gesturing to work with. I otherwise like wearing a mask, but I am eager to understand people better again.
Same, HoH my whole life and have never had such a hard time shopping as I do now. 
Can't read lips, sound is muffled by mask and barrier. 
Doesn't take long before I just offer a non-commital noise because I've already asked them to repeat themselves eight times.
And yet customers don’t stay behind it anymore
This article reads more like propganda for the UK than anything *actually* news. 
>Jean-Luc Mélenchon...wrote
This guy is a perennial last place finisher in elections. I don't think the international community gets too concerned about pronouncements made by Max Bernier either.
Beware, last time they gave you Quebec !
They will just wave a white flag
Meh, if French military history is any guide, they'll surrender pretty quick.
> This article reads more like propganda for the UK than anything actually news. 
That tracks for the source, The Express is one of those typical right-wing tabloid rags, like the Daily Mail, The Sun, etc.  Just check out the sample front page on the paper's [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Express) for an idea of their slant/views.  Just another of their anti-French/anti-Europe pieces coming out when Boris has managed to annoy France and Europe for the millionth time.
As for Melenchon, Monsieur "la Republique c'est moi!" is a clown.
Err do you know anything about French military history outside of the World Wars?
The French have a very strong and formidable military history beyond children making memes about them making the absolutely correct decision to surrender during the Blitzkreig. The populace then went on to be a serious thorn in the Germans side via resistance forces. If you think the French people couldn't absolutely fuck shit up if needed you'd be in for a bad time.
uninformed comment, throughout history France has been the most successful land army in continental Europe.
>  Just another of their anti-French/anti-Europe pieces coming out when Boris has managed to annoy France and Europe for the millionth time.
Quelle surprise!
Well there was Waterloo and Trafalgar.
You're right. 
They also basically surrendered in Algeria. 
Oh and Viet Nam.
They do!
> Trafalgar
Depending on how you measure success, France won that war.
>During the war, France and its client states under Napoleon I, defeated an alliance, the Third Coalition, made up of the United Kingdom, the Holy Roman Empire, the Russian Empire, Naples, Sicily and Sweden.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_Third_Coalition
But the entire century was just a clusterfuck of battles, wars and shifting alliances.
The US surrendered in Vietnam and Iraq but we don't really remember them as 'surrenderers' or something.
Some people forget that France won five of the seven wars against the various coalitions, often outnumbered and against the odds (particularly the first two wars), and by the last two came about the country was just plain exhausted from 20+ years of fighting the combined armies of Europe.  
> Depending on how you measure success, France won that war.
Is there much of a debate otherwise?  They lost at Trafalgar, okay, but they smashed the Austrians at Austerlitz and at the end of the war the Holy Roman Empire ceased to exist.
>Is there much of a debate otherwise? 
Not about the war, but about the longer term success of the whole endeavor. 
The war of the Third Coalition ended in 1805. The next ten years saw nothing but war after virtually indistinguishable war and then it was over in 1815. Follow by a century of political chaos. 
Although, in fairness, by the metric I've laid out there have been very few truly successful nations. On that score, I don't think Canadians realize how lucky we've been.
To be fair, it is necessary to mention that Napoleon was Italian, not French. Thus, we can not give 100% credit to France.
His family was of Genoese and Tuscan origin (Italy did not yet exist as a country, right?), and Corsican and Italian were his mother tongues, but he was born in France - Corsica having been ceded to France a little over a year before he was born - and he later learned French anyways.  By birth he was French, and by his choice (learning French, joining French military, leading France) you could say he was French.  He'd be French of Genoese origin, but still French, right?
It's kinda like the unlicensed pilot who flew commercial airliners for decades; at a certain point it doesn't even matter anymore.
The way nurses are being treated these days, why would she do this to herself?
She's been at it long enough to have graduated from Nursing school at least twice.
Wow, Ottawa, Calgary, Vancouver.  At least back to 2010
https://calgary.ctvnews.ca/mobile/police-searching-for-fake-nurse-1.529725
Gross.
Jesus nursing is utterly shit and with pay cuts this year you'd have to be nuts
At this point they're desperate enough that if she was doing well, they should have just kept her on
Catch me if you can!
If she worked on the ward for the unvaccinated Covid infected, would it be wrong of me to think, "Why not?"
Wouldn't she need to register with the college of nurses in the province and then provide proof of that to the employer? That's what I have to do every year.
Didn’t he become a doctor afterwards?
She was probably after probably after series of unsafe events reported by her colleagues that flagged management to investigate… she was caught doing this in Ontario and Alberta and clearly caught each time because she doesn’t have nurse expertise
Because with her *actual* credentials the pay is still better than McDonald's or waving at people in Walmart.
Because they make bank?
OK that's why they have her locked up now-**No Bail**
Liability reasons.  If the nurse fucks up and the nurse is accredited, it's the nurse's problem.  If the 'nurse' fucks up and the nurse turns out to be a sham, then it's the hospital's problem and whoever hired the 'nurse'.
You'd never want someone who would do something that sketchy to be caring for people.
Ya really. Honorary trial by fire
It says she impersonated a nurse that is registered and submitted forged documents to her employer
Not really, government legislates caps on our wages

My league has had blind refs for years.
I swear my goalie is blind too
Pretty cool. I had no idea blind hockey even existed.
Watching a video of it, I'm really impressed with how well they can track the puck. At least from video it looks like the hardest part for them is taking shots on target unless they are close to the net, so that probably helps the goalie out a bit.
[Demo for anybody curious](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lus657GM24)
Awesome. By the way things are going he could potentially back up Demko in Vancouver with the way those guys have been running things.
I'd kinda feel like a dick if I were on a breakaway against this guy and didn't just shoot it into his logo though, right?
>Rego became visually impaired in 2001 and, though doctors don't know why, his eyesight continued to deteriorate until he was fully blind. 
Well that's horrifying
I came looking for a comment like this and you didn't disappoint.
Boeing put tariffs on Canadian jets.  Fuck Boeing.
They should have offered us duct tape and super glue instead
No tears from me on this given Boeing's really malicious conduct in the past.
The F-35 has matured enough that I believe costs have declined and the platform has improved in reliability and function.   Gripens did have some features that might have been relevant: lower and easier maintenance, deployable from almost anything but I have not kept up enough to know if this is all true of the latest model or even the costing basis of one vs the other. 
My gut check is that it will be the F-35 and perhaps at this juncture that is the right call all things considered.
I hope it's spite, fuck Boeing.
>Collins questioned whether the so-called "Boeing clause" played any part in the fighter jet competition — though officials have said it was not a factor as the dispute was resolved in Bombardier's favour in 2018.
It was resolved after the damage had been done and Bombardier had to gift half the program to Airbus. 
Fuck Boeing.
Just buy the fucking F-35 and get on with it - it’s been over a decade now. It’s the only 5th Gen fighter and integrates with the only other country we need it to.
Not shocking at all
It says lockheed and Saab are still in contention , so i guess we’ll see what happens
Can we do the same to SAAB and carry on with the 7 year delayed F35 purchase?
Boeing is acting like a rookie.
The steps to get money from Trudeau are simple.
1. Start a charity, call it We Boeing Charity.
2. Hire Justin's mom, wife, brother as speakers at a bs event.
3. Promise some of the work will be Quebec. It's about jabs jabs jobs.
4. Even offer to partner up with Bombardier. This way you get the money, but never deliver. It's about ze jobs.
5. Build a substandard building at the bottom of a drained lake. It's about the environment.
6. Deliver a plane after a long period. Preferably a glider, call it an eco friendly jet that allows pilots to throw rocks instead of environmentally unfriendly nitrate boms.
They can/will deteriorate just like our whole navy fleet. Unreal. We are going to be dropped from NATO at this rate. A G20 country that can’t defend itself.
Boeing is an absolute trash company and we shouldn't be buying a pencil off them let alone aircraft.
It will be F35.
Awesome. Let’s get the f-35
If we could defend our skies we might start to get too uppity when the Americans or Russians or Europeans steal our resources in the north. Can't be having that - it's the same reason Harper's promise of 1000s of new boats in the water to protect our shores never happened.
Our resources are worth too much to our foreign owners to risk any real self-sufficiency or defense for the colony of Canada.
Fucking Boeing.
Team Gripen.
War is a racket.
So its going to be the gripens?
Didn’t Boeing strong arm Bombardier in closing down their C Series production in the US? Isn’t their aircraft responsible for hundreds of deaths? If their fighter jets run anything like their commercial planes than I guess this was a great call
When our largest trading partner constantly goes against our interests why should we prioritize theirs
So it seems that she wants to actively give Trudeau ammo for his claims that the CPC wants to reopen the abortion debate again. Real smart........not.
I saw a lot of CPC voters on this sub talking about how she would be perfect to replace O’Toole and that she’d be able to defeat Trudeau.  I think if she was leader, the Liberals would have likely had a strong majority. 
Anti-abortion pregnancy centres purposely feed vulnerable people misinformation in bad faith.  They shouldn’t have charitable status because they aren’t a charity.   Lewis could never be PM as the vast, vast majority of Canadians are pro choice and wouldn’t vote for someone who chose to die on this hill.
I remember people on here rooting for Leslyn Lewis as a good candidate for CPC leadership and that the CPC will not open up on gay rights or abortions... 
Where you people at?
SoCons are a dying breed but they will make sure they take down the CPC with it.
Just one of the reasons the Conservatives will never get back into power.
God what a stupid fucking thing to do.
"The abortion debate is over." "Liberals only bring up wedge politics  during elections to scare voters."
axe, not ace.
Of course she did. Another "moderate"
The CPC: "we are not bringing back the abortion debate"
Also the CPC: *brings back the abortion debate*
The charity tax lawyer quoted in this article raises valid legal concerns about the precedent this sets for pulling the plug on charities with no real process for accountability. Sure, some crisis pregnancy centres are fronts for the sort of militant anti-abortion sentiment that feeds those people you see standing on roadsides holding placards of butchered infants. But many others are well-meaning charities that do nothing but provide resources to give women an alternative when circumstances of poverty or desperation might be pushing them to an abortion. The Trudeau government is offering no litmus test for making any distinction - they want them all shut down because it appeases his progressive wedge issue voter base, and, like the revived conversion therapy bill, is another distraction from the Liberals’ inaction, or downright enabling, of the housing crisis, inflation, and general decline in the quality of life in Canada.
What did you expect from Leslyn "kill the gays" Lewis ?   
Woman is the most homophobic sitting MP.
[removed]
Try reminding people that just 172 days ago, two-thirds of all CPC MPs voted to re-criminalize abortion, and to force Canadian physicians to become a Stasi-like snitch brigade, required to report any patients who request abortions to the federal Ministry of Health. See where your post ends up.
No French skills and a political philosophy based entirely on US-style Evangelical Christianity would have obliterated the CPC in Quebec and suburban areas.
Then I say, vote her in as O'Toole's replacement. Then it's out with the PPC, the Green Party and then CPC. That will just leave Jagmeet and Justine, then First-Past-the -Post system will become relevant.
Remember, this is a party so chock-a-block with the wilfully ignorant and/or incompetent judges of character that they came within *less than 1%* of electing Maxime Bernier as their Glorious Leader; he lost the leadership race by something like 450 votes, out of a membership of more than a quarter million.
It would be disingenuous to frame this as the Conservatives opening up the abortion debate.  Lewis is just responding to a Liberal policy. It's the Liberals that are trying to change the status quo and reopen the debate by stripping these organizations of their charitable status.
Eventually the Liberals will slip up or become unpopular enough. It's just pathetic that waiting for that seems to be the CPC's primary electoral strategy.
Jesus seeing this same arrogant partisan shit being said on every thread gets old. Do ya really think the pendulum stopped? That the liberals, like every other party in Canadian history won’t become insufferable even to his supporters? Do you honestly think we’ve broken the mold? Are you really that absent minded? Or are you just parroting shitty Reddit talking points because you identify as a big l Liberal?
Inflation, housing and cost of living at record levels and the government is still spending time on this useless legislation.
Fuck off with this. The endgame is so transparently to block every streamer except crave.
Why? Canadian companies can't play in an unrigged market? Perhaps we can arrange for participation prizes while we're at it.
Do these experts work for bell and Rogers?
No regulation is needed.
Big Three telling what the government should do? How about letting the market decide?
Doubling down on a bad strategy IMO.
Why, so we can pay more for shittier services?
Yes, what could go wrong. If the government gets involved in what Canadians want to watch on streaming sites, they will royally fuck it up. It's what they do. It's telling that this bunch are even considering this a priority.
We have more important things to worry about right now.
Well, Netflix has supported local production quotas but they've long said they want changes to better reflect the reality today.
A Netflix-funded Quebec movie isn't considered Canadian, for example.
>Elsewhere, Cardin argued that the Canadian points system needs a “holistic revision” so that streaming entities such as Netflix are able to create content that qualifies as Canadian. “We need a revision of the criteria or the parameters that make a \[project\] a Canadian production,” he said, citing the feature The Decline as an example of a project created and produced entirely in Quebec. “It didn’t qualify as a Canadian production, given that Netflix financed it completely,” he said.  
>  
>“The concern we have is that even when the majority of key creative positions are held by Canadian on shows that we produce, there is also another element which is the element of financing and ownership, which can preclude a production from being certified as Canadian, even if 10 out of 10, eight out of 10, or six out of 10 key creative positions are held by Canadians,” he said.

The government only follows their money, this is what their lobbying pays for. The PM does not give a flying fuck about the rest. Who's paying him to even care?
They have these things called committees, and there are several of them, so that parliament can walk and chew bubble gum at the same time. Do you actually understand how legislative assemblies work?
Which is hot fucking garbage.
Tried the trial, had to cancel after 3 days because it just didn't work properly at all.
Following government logic:
"These people know what they're talking about, because they actually work in the industry, so we consider them the only experts worth talking to!"
This is what I don't get. Even if the government's proposed regulation regime wasn't *fucking terrible* (and to be clear, it absolutely is)... what are these deleterious consequences of non-regulation that are supposedly justifying this push? Why do they *need* regulation? Who's actually been harmed by a lack of regulations on fucking *Netflix*?

I've seen no evidence of that.
I work in education and addressing this issue of male mental health requires far more than simply addressing the symptoms. The root causes are far more entrenched. As others have commentated, the feelings of disaffection that many young men feel is not a coincidence, but likely speaks to a large trend in how either they perceive their place in society and/or how they are led to feel that others view their worth in that context. Many simply feel there is no future for them. No amount of therapy will solve the problem of someone feeling like they don't have a purpose, a place, or a future. It might help for a while, or curb the worst spikes in suicidal ideation for a time, but the regression to the feeling like you have no intrinsic value, that no one cares about your problems, that you are expendable, and that your problems don't matter as much as others will always return to haunt them.
"A man is only loved under the condition that he provide something."
Honestly, it's scary what you see on the education side of things, even just how it's discussed in studies and reports in pedagogical research or other studies. You'll see stats applauding that 58% of college graduates are women, that girls out perform boys at every level academically from middle school to grad school. But no one asks, "so that's great girls/women are doing well, but doesn't that also mean the boys/men are struggling like heck?" But discussing these things is taboo; one of my peers during my postgrad was studying this problem "what's happening to the boys?". When she first mentioned her topic for her research in one of her seminars, there was an immediate disquiet from some in the room, like when your cooky great uncle makes an off-colour comment at Thanksgiving dinner and everyone awkwardly sits there for a moment trying to pretend that didn't just happen. We will praise female achievement (nothing wrong with doing so), but not realize the flip side of the coin that if your metric for achievement is relative performance to the other half of society, high relative success for one side correlates with low relative success for the other.
On that topic of education: about 90% of primary school staff and something like 70% of high school staff are women. Personally, I only met an adult male in a schooling for the first time in grade 6 (c. mid 2000s) when a new English teacher started, and it was a huge thing / novelty in the school for the students that a male teacher was there. Based on the struggling of male youth, you could make a strong argument for an equity hiring policy to get more men involved in the education professions because of a need for more male role models in that environment. But that idea is not one people area people are seemingly ready to discuss (as a side note, pursuing a teaching career often involves unpaid internships, subbing for a couple years on a meagre salary, multiple degrees, etc --- these are barriers to access for people from low income backgrounds, for instance. It often means that the teachers students in low-income areas are being taught by someone who has no lived experience they can relate to. This is something - the lack of a teacher who you can see yourself in their lived experiences - that we discuss in that context, so we shouldn't have qualms about discussing it in the case of a lack of male professionals either).
I think the rhetoric and discourse we use around these things has to change because it's alienating for young men and boys. Take for example this quote from Amnesty International (I'm teaching a unit on human rights right now so I happen to have this handy lol): "Governments at all levels instituted public health measures in response to COVID-19. There were concerns about inadequate responses for groups experiencing disproportionate impact, including *Indigenous Peoples, Black and racialized communities, women, older persons, sex workers, people seeking asylum, and migrant workers*." It's very easy to read a statement like that if you are already feeling disaffected as a white male (in this case) under retirement age that your experience of COVID wasn't as bad as everyone else's. In other words, it's fairly easy for one to read that and think that it's saying whatever struggles you went through - losing family or friends, losing your job, getting sick yourself, and so on - doesn't matter by comparison.
And this is not to advocate some men's rights thing at all, moreso that you can partially explain some of the disaffected people who turn to things like that based on the perception that the society they live in "doesn't give a shit about me or my problems."
This all to say: far more needs to be done then funding more 1-800 numbers, offering free consultations, and Bell let's talk days.
I wouldn't say it's a "silent" crisis, everyone knows this. It's just that no one cares.
Can we please have a system with readily available mental health. Therapy shouldn't just be for those with a good insurance plan.
Being concerned about male mental health in 2021 is literally microaggression and toxic something-or-other.
/s
Because nobody fucking cares. My friend ended his life 2 years ago and many people told him to man up. He never even got the chance to see a specialist. A man with mental problems is always reminded to man up.
I live in a small town and a few men in my circle have killed themselves. All white, mostly well off, wife, kids. At least 2 of them happened when the wife wanted a divorce. And then in that group, at least 2 of their dads killed themselves when these people were teenagers (not fathers of the recent ones, just in the same social group).
Seems pretty surreal.
Male suicide: the "you better stay silent" crisis.
Sadly that's not even limited to what is male-blamingly deemed the "toxic masculinity" portion of society. Such deeming in fact contributes to the suicides.
This isn't surprising to me. I think a lot of people don't really know how to deal with it when someone they know is suicidal.
I am feeling great now, but I've dealt with suicidal thoughts before in the past. At the time, the most I had was a friend tell me I seemed down and ask if I was seeing a therapist. It would have gone much further for me to sit down with them and talk for an hour.
Most of my friends found me to be a downer and actually avoided me more, which made things worse. I think there are a lot of people who believe that they can't do anything for the mental health of people in their lives.
Do you ever hate posters or ads with stats like “1 in 4 suicide victims/homeless/etc are female.” Okay, what about 3/4? Where’s the funding for them? Where’s the men’s shelters? 
The one guy who did open a men’s shelter to help men was bullied and harassed into committing suicide.
I know two men that took their own lives this year; in June and August. Both were gregarious, outgoing guys with big personalities and lots of friends. One had a wife and young son, worked with kids and families and was very well known and widely loved. The other had a big, extended close family and a seemingly envious career. 
Mental health is health. Take care of yourself first and prioritize all aspects of your health. I struggle daily. This year has been bad. 
Stay safe
"Women most affected"
I challenge anyone to find me the Google doodle for International Men's Day that occurred last week.
This isn’t a silent crisis, it’s well known. However people don’t give a single fuck about male mental health as long as they haven’t killed someone.
Have worked at a crisis line for years. This ain't new but glad to see it getting attention.
As a mostly white male, I'm told daily how I'm a terrible person, I'm racist, I'm sexist, I'm homophobic, I'm privileged; and on-top of all that I should be ashamed for struggling with all my advantages.
I'm not any of those things, there are 4 lights, but there's only so much a person can take.
In reality, I have noone in my life, I work 60+ hours at suppressed wages just to survive, I'm overweight, and I don't see a future without some meme stock rocket ship getting me out of middle class slavery.
At least for the middle aged males it feels like we’re the new punching bag for jokes. Commercials, acceptable jokes with friends? Better make fun of the middle aged male, because he can take it right?  And you’re helping with the laundry and dishes and cooking right? And still handling the stereotypical guy jobs too?  And working a full time job from home?  Good. You’re still incompetent though <cue laugh track>.
Like we fly the pride flag at school, have special STEM programs for Girls, we need support groups for males. At all levels upto corporate.
Why is a thread about an article about suicide filled with people blaming Trudeau?  The article isn’t political, it’s not laying blame on a party or politician?
It’s a little deranged.
Why is it so difficult to talk to a psychologist in this country? I called a hotline a while ago and was told I would need a recommendation from my doctor to see someone. People should be able to walk in and talk to a professional if they're depressed, not jump through the hoops of bureaucracy.

Wow, a 2nd dumbshit headline from the National Post this morning.

I’m such a genius I blame politicians for the weather.
They are going to address the floods with a flood tax.   That will fix it.
Yes, John. The carbon tax is to help prevent huge disaster like this. That's what it do.
This has to be satire, right?
The conservstives would offer the floods flood conversion therapy.
You can change the dates in the article to literally any date from the last decade and it will read exactly the same.

Yeahh lock in the rates! /s
Starting to seeing it in Calgary. Active listings of detached properties are at a decade low and keeps declining month over month. In 2019 Nov we had 3,200 listings. Today we have just 1,600. (And last month that figure was 2,000)

Time to turn on the immigration tap otherwise we risk seeing wages rise. Can't have those dirty poors making more money.
over 1 million underpaid jobs wow
Unfortunately I work cheque vs cheque. I'm not in the position to refuse any job. But I do envy people who can afford to refuse a job.
Ironically they estimated in Aug that there are 1.5 million unemployed.
So these jobs pay a wage you can live on?
Or are we talking barely scraping above minimum wage bullshit jobs?
I have a solution... increase immigration!  Priority to family reunification, so we get extra grandma and grandpas too!

This but unironically.
Well you should look and see if there are others hiring in your field paying more.
Could be an opportunity to boost your wage
If you have a degree or technical diploma just apply for whatever. Honestly, 90% of jobs can be learned at work and sometimes you get this ridiculous job for random reasons just because you applied. Worst case, you still have this job. Or, just do the horrific task of teaching yourself excel to a high level with the many free resources, and up your chances like 80%.
Not at all if the jobs cant provide a living.
As a worker I'm perfectly fine with a labour shortage. Just means I have more leverage when requesting wage increase and benefits.
I agree. We need more people who need healthcare.
Yes we really need to report how many created “jobs” are actually jobs that require 36-40 hours per week and pay near the median income. 
Business owners who create part time, low wage positions are not helping the economy: they’re just sucking up capital and getting a super low return.
They'll be at or above minimum wage though, right?
Surely that's better than getting *nothing*
Absolutely agree with you.
Or you can improve your skill level and have more leverage instead of relying on other external factors where you have no control. Remember that the government is running the country like a business (priority is economic development) and it's not there to babysit you.
With or without hijabs? Or is this not a cultural issue? Gl. They will come to Ontario first.
TL;DR: there were 743 murders in 2020, an increase of 56 compared to 2019.  
The mass-murder of 22 people in Nova Scotia accounted for a sizeable share of the increase, but not all of it obviously.
Funny how tacticool rifles aren’t that common in murders - instead it’s concealable and smuggleable pistols that aren’t being arbitrarily banned.
Summary:
* The two most populated cities in Alberta, Calgary and Edmonton, recorded large increases and each contributed 15 more murders to the national tally than in 2019.
* While murders increased during the year when most people were forced to stay at home due to COVID restrictions, the crime severity index, which measures the volume and severity of police-reported crime in Canada, decreased 8 per cent, data showed.
* There were 15 more firearm-related killings in Canada last year, compared with 2019.
What do you mean criminals don’t obey gun laws?
how can that possibly be a thing? seems like we need to ban more hunting rifles.
So the article doesn't specify  but I'm going to go out on a limb and guess a lot of this increase was domestic abuse related.
Especially since other crime and gang stats were down.
Murders are rare. There are a lot more crimes on the rise that are having a terrible effect on society. This is what happens when you elect a pretty sock wearing trust fund baby who promises lowering crime by removing guns from hunters
Guns for law abiding citizens are banned.
Murders in the country spiked.
A 22 victim killing spree will do that.
More victims of climate change.
I wonder if this correlates to an increase in gang activity?
whats with the graphic ??
Going to file this one under no shit. Lockdowns have a negative toll on mental health. Not to mention forcing roommates and spouses into close quarters together for extended periods of time.
And that's a good thing!
Obviously because population has increased wtf is this reporting
Instead of counting murders, why don't they count murderers? That would give us a better number considering what happened last year.
WELP
So much for all those people whom, growing up kept telling us
"we're at the best point in history! crime has gone down x amount since the 90s!"
Like, does anyone remember how peaceful it was in 2018
another sign of the downfall of society, people are getting more desperate and violent
Must be guns
Meh. I'll just stop eating dairy.
Whatever.
Cartels are gonna cartel.  Price me out of Canadian products and I'll look for alternatives.  They can sit on their milk tankers and rotate.
Not a farmer anymore nor are my brothers or cousins but if somebody here spots a BMW on a dairy farm, .....well now you know where the local banker is.
It's almost like government protectionism of an industry is wrong 😂🤣😂. Who could have seen this coming 🤷‍♂️
Just like inflation isn't transitory and isn't going to get much worse. The government doesn't care about cost of living increases for the citizens obviously. If they did, they wouldn't be increasing existing and implementing new taxes, on top of insane spending, borrowing and money printing practices. Government is the problem, not the solution.
This is an interesting article and I agree with the points about the board being solely composed of people with a conflict of interest has to be addressed.
My recollection is that Ontario has its own milk marketing board so I wonder if this decision has any impact in Ontario?
I would have to know more then just the points in this article to determine an actual fair price increase. Canada has supply side management, America has ginormous govt subsidies - govt farm aid makes up between 65% and 70% of farm income from my recollection.  In Canada diary farmers get negligible guaranteed farm income from govt (although they can access loan mechanisms and other indirect supports) in return for being allowed to have marketing boards wherein farmers collude to set a floor price.  Each is a diff form of subsidy but the CAD system is determined to a greater extent by choice to purchase whereas in America it comes out of your tax dollars which is no choice in the payment process by you the end consumer.  Someone wrote an examination of the two during the USMCA talks and and found American dairy farmers are in fact subsidized twice but again it was some time ago and I don't recall the details.
Part of the reason supply side management is kept in place is so that rural Canada does not become a desert.  Canadian farms are more independent owned and more prosperous - there are large rural landscapes in America where every small town is a ghost town - a great deal has been written on this in many American publications/news organizations.
I guess I am of the opinion that while at first blush a highly questionable decision has been made I think we do not have all the facts.  If it is that grevious hopefully other public pressure will come to bare on this and government will act - the feds can overturn any decision if they really desire to do such.
Just stop drinking milk.
Average person votes for this too.
They are scared of American Dairy...
FARMERS BAD!  WE CAN IMPORT OUR FOOD!

Milk is not good for you regardless, hit them where it hurts. Don’t buy it.
Milk is like 4.49 in Ontario. That's like 1.12 a litre.
Besides water, what else can you buy that cheap? *And* it has to go through a fucking cow before it gets to you.
Milk almost seems undervalued.
Edit: Also, I remember the milk sign at my local Macs Milk was at 4.29 for *years* while everything else went up and up and up... a 10% increase doesn't seem totally unreasonable considering how long it DIDN'T rise with inflation.
Dairy farmers might as well be  licorice farmers, y'all know you don't NEED milk or cheese right? Lol
The milk industry is subsidized in both Canada and the US.
In Canada, it is subsidized through the supply management which sets the price and how much milk can be produced.  This means that the people who are buying the milk are paying the subsidy.
In the US the dairy industry is subsidized through the government, which means that every person (regardless of if they buy dairy or not) is subsidizing the industry.  If you look into it, the US dairy is about the same as Canadian dairy when you factor in the subsidies.
I prefer the Canadian system where the users are the ones who pay for it.
are there US brands of milk I can buy in Canada? I absolutely loath the dairy board and it's cartel practices. I would pay extra for American Dairy to stick it to the Canadian Dairy board.
Canada needs Lab grown cheese companies ASAP!
I don’t see the issue here, this is just a politically motivated story. It says milk prices “could” jump by 10%, which even if it did, would be 30-50 cents more when you buy your milk. Everything else has went up proportionally, and dairy farmers (who literally work 365 days a year to make sure we have milk) costs have went crazy this year too. It has been an unusually crazy year with inflation, etc so why shouldn’t they get an increase?
Cue Maxime Bernier...he's been telling us this for years.
High inflation and huge increase in fuel costs but they can’t increase prices. Makes sense
I'm gonna start milking my dogs.
everything but the wage will go up, raise ur milk, it'll go sour in the store .. ill drink beer instead
I guess I won't be buying cheese anymore, I already don't drink milk other than in my coffee, I actually don't mind black coffee so I'll probably stop buying milk/cream as well.

Either do it, or don't. 
We already know that Canada *may* retaliate, you aren't providing any new information, Freeland.
We have won multiple times before on this issue, cant see anything different happening this time around. Without Canadian lumber, US homes building grinds to a halt.
Canada *better* retaliate
>Canada is prepared to retaliate against an American increase of duties on Canadian softwood lumber producers, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said Thursday.  
>  
>“We will do precisely what we have done successfully with two previous American administrations: we state our case clearly and rationally. We also make very, very clear that Canada is prepared to retaliate, to defend the national interest,” Freeland said in response to criticism in the House of Commons.
While the Americans don't like Canadian oil, they certainly like the electricity from our hydroelectric dams. Perhaps we should flip the off switch for a few days.
I'm sure we could make use of the lumber here to help fill the demand for affordable housing we so badly need.
Time to hit back on products made in blue states or purple states.
She’ll probably talk about our “hurt feelings” again repeating her “tough” action on Trump’s protectionist policies. 🙄

Lmao this incompetent journalist is so far over her head it's on the verge of Insanity
What are you going to do Freeland? Cry again? Worked great for us last time.
The government responds to increasing tariffs on softwood but have  allowed real estate in Canada to quadruple in 10 years. That's politics folks.
With what? Maple syrup ban lol
Cut a deal so the Americans drop the softwood duty rate in exchange for Canada dropping the tarrif on US dairy products.
Why is Freeland responding and not Trudeau.  Fuck sakes have some balls Trudeau
Will we be retaliating before or after she cries on the floor about how bad the orange ma... I mean old man is?
Looks like Trudeau's corruptment is always behind the ball. 
Don't they get intelligence report on things like this.
Trump and Biden have blocked the appointment of new appellate judges at the WTO, so that's not an option.

>Liberal House Leader Mark Holland has said he's heard from MPs with compromised immune systems who are uncomfortable with the idea of being in the chamber with Conservative MPs who refuse to get vaccinated.
This is a valid reason. Nobody wants to hang out with pro plague MPs. I also find it hilarious that Rempel who lives in Oklahoma opposes dialling in even though she did it all of last year!
It's a fair argument, but then Trudeau can counter that O'Toole did most of his campaigning from an Ottawa hotel while he was on the road. *Was O'Toole just hiding while I faced down rock-throwing protestors?* lol
CPC position makes no sense. Wouldn't it be more accountability since questions can be asked remotely and in person?
O'Toole is becoming more unhinged everyday and to think his party could have won the election.
Goddamn that's *stupid*. 
After 20+ months of everyone being forced to Zoom everything it's also a losing argument with Canadians.
The easy solution is vaccine mandates, there shouldn't be antivaxxers in parliament.
The Cons are upset that they can't act like children and get away with it in virtual Parliament
fucky off O'Tool. either get your MP's vaccinated and move on or even better just quit politics.
This is what happens when you refuse to back vaccine mandates. To me, that's ducking accountability on ignoring that entire issue in his party.
Then get your MPs vaxed O’toole or stfu
He sounds like a loser who can't get over his loss. Well, conservative party continues to be the party of anti-science.
Another O'Toole flip-flop.  He opposed vaccination requirements so Trudeau throws him a bone with an option for virtual attendance and O'Toole pisses and moans about that, too.
I understand that it's the specific role of the official opposition to challenge everything the leading party brings forward but at some point he has to just say, "No, we're not going to waste time complaining about that."
I would love it if the Conservative party would just get rid of this fool and replace him with someone who has a bit of dignity and integrity.
Why is O'Toole ducking his accountability to Canadian citizens and pushing to have unvaccinated MPs in parliament?
Using virtual format as the excuse sounds like a lame attempt to call out what is basically a constant thing in Canadian politics, way before Covid.
O'Toole and his band of chucklefucks could always just get fucking vaccinated. They don't deserve to sit in Parliament. 
I say to hell with the virtual sitting and the CPC can just warm the bench until they're fit to sit in Parliament.
How?  Because Cons MPs doesn't know how to use Zoom?  Or computer?   All Canadians learned how to work virtually, why can't Cons MPs and Cons MPs only can't ??????   Mmmm... are they losing benefits and allowance if not in Ottawa?????
I watched his TV interview. It was all good when he was bashing Trudeau but when he was asked about his party and leadership he grabbed his papers and ran away!
Is there really any rush to go back to the office?

If Trudeau is so in favour of virtual meetings why did he go on vacation to the climate summit instead of virtual this year?

> Police are asking everyone in Vanderhoof to stay inside or shelter in place, lock their doors, and not leave their home or business. Everyone is told to avoid the downtown area and follow police instructions.
> They say they are only looking for one male suspect driving a pick-up truck. That suspect is considered armed and dangerous.
> A localized police Emergency Alert has been issued in Vanderhoof. Anyone in that area or about to enter the area could receive an emergency text alert advising of the situation.
UPDATE : [Suspect in Custody](https://twitter.com/akurjata/status/1463981260397690885?t=maQivk-YCORcexMbkezL9Q&s=19)
Evacuate all the fire stations just in-case.
Wow they actually tried warning people this time!??
Wow the RCMP actually sent out an alert about an active shooter, what a fucking shock
I wonder if this is related to the Qnon person telling people to shoot people yesterday.
Better start going after legal gun owners, no need to investigate!
So, In response, the RCMP will shoot up another fire station?
Well obviously this isn’t good but as a northern British Columbian I know how scummy the RCMP are around here. Hopefully no one was hurt. I’m curious as to the shooters motive for such a self defeating act.

I just wanna know how this is the first time the alert was used in BC but we get them in Ontario all the time, even if the crime is a custody dispute 200km away
I may be wrong but my understanding is the suspect took a shot or shots at he RCMP office in Vanderhoof.
They seemed to be shooting police this time so it was actually an emergency.
The shooter was shooting at the RCMP
Hope the Nova Scotia RCMP are taking notes
Imagine if they just posted on Reddit instead
Could equally be related to the FN pipeline issue not far from there.
[Here's the video of police taking the suspect into custody](https://twitter.com/Resalviant/status/1464001076311441408)...methinks I hear the word "vaccine" at the very beginning of the video.
I mean if they don’t run with this I’d be disappointed they have to wait years and years for crimes like this to happen

Key words promise and if. Both lies I'm sure.
$100B in kickbacks back to their own party. Never change quebec Liberals.
All us taxpayers better get our butts in gear to pay for all this liberal spending
Thats a big IF, the liberals have basically no chance of winning anything outside the island of Montréal
I'm just waiting for Legault to respond with something along the lines of it's due to his Government's fiscal management during the pandemic that allows the Liberals to make such an offer.
...it's almost going to be a CAQ sweep here...and as a Englishman I'm perfectly okay with that.
Hydrogen is really stupid and this is just one more reason to not vote liberal. Anyone selling you on hydrogen is selling you a bridge to nowhere.
Look up the efficiency of producing and compressing hydrogen compared to charging a battery.
Instead of dumping all that hydro in the states for pennies they could be making hydrogen and people could heat their houses with it with no pollution, sounds like a plan
In order to offset carbon emissions we should turn to vessels that instead of burning jet engine fuel and carry us on planes.  Turn to lumbering behemoths with hydrogen, helium in order to float us through the air.  Thoughts?
nothing bad could ever come from a bunch of hydrogen flying around
Now, if QS could stop tripping over themself and become the main opposition... we could have a pretty good government imo.
The QS are shady in my eyes.  If the PQ were Coke...then QS would be New Coke Zero.
Leaning back towards my Anglais... I'd rather a "federalist" party be the opposition just in case Franacophones let the power get to their head.   Legault has widespread support and last thing I want would be for him to start thinking we're becoming complacent.
The problem with the liberal is that they are a party that just follow the leader. Jean Lesage and René Levesque used to be liberal... it used to be a nationalist quebec party.
We had a more "federalist" wave with Jean Charest and Couillard... but honestly the party might turn more nationalist with Anglade at the head.
the chinese will respond by assembling 75% of the product in xinjiang and finish it in a third party country like vietnam, making it a vietnamese product
Won’t matter. Liberals will still make sure that the CBSA will look the other way. Liberal affiliated Senators will still vote in favour of the genocidal regime in Beijing.
Nice to see at least one Senator doing the right thing.
Wonder how long until he is paid off or silenced.
Where's the law to stop them from owning our homes
Ethnic Turkic people get thrown into military style labor groups to be contracted out to various factories on the cheap across the country.
https://www.aspi.org.au/report/uyghurs-sale
There's really no way to avoid getting Chinese goods made with slave labor. And I say that definitively, because the US and Canada will never commit to doing anything impactful. Other than these token gestures.
Doesn't matter, they'll be rebranded as from Hong Kong.
[removed]
Was proposed by a Conservative senator, so of course the Liberals and NDP will vote against it.
I bet the PM is already trying to find ways around it.
Because transshipment isnt a multibillion dollar a year industry?
Has no one seen wardogs?
Cool, so are we going to ban imports from illegal Israeli settlements or are we cool with oppression when our "allies" do it?
Ban hammer China?
Sounds too good to be true. One step closer to world peace.
Great! Now let's start cracking down on dirty Chinese money laundered through the Canadian economy. Wait, wait, wait...no...not the window again...stop...\*CRASH\*....AAAAAaaaaa........
Lol. How about a ban on anything made in a country that wouldn't meet labour standards here.
We already ban goods produced in prisons, so just classify Xinjiang region products appropriately. This seems kind of routine, honestly, it's just nice to see they actually recognize this.
How enforceable and impactful. Who is this for? We blatantly know that so many of our goods are made with child labour or other types of exploited labour and it hardly changes anything.
Ah....that explains why dhgate got so expensive, and why my Shein stuff took so long to get here.
do we do the same for our yankee overlord's forced labour products from their prison systems ?
Oh know, I'm sure this won't be foiled by a $10.00/ month PO box in HK
Or we could just try shifting away from buying anything from China if we can help it.  I don't mind spending a few bucks more for cheap stuff made in Mexico instead of Asia.  We should be thinking about a more North American manufacturing strategy, instead of constantly importing cheap goods from China, and other countries like it.

Giving money away should cure the inflation. /s
Enjoy your new 700 Million yearly expenditure Quebec. This is probably not going to stay as a 1 time payment. At least as long as inflation keeps going up, less people will qualify for the benefit.
Quebec wants to fight inflation, by pumping more money into the economy to be spent, which drives up inflation. This must be where Trudeau learned his economics.
First CERB, now this. How many ways can we send Bezos money? So much of this money is just going to go buy cheap Amazon shit. Bad for Canada, bad for environment.
Ralph bucks have always and will always be popular. It's bad policy, that money is better used invested in someway but if they didn't do this it would be a tax cut for the Rich so this is fine.
This is what helps create inflation lmao
What could possibly go wrong?
^^^/s
WHAT THE FUCK. Do they understand what inflation is?
"All single Quebecers whose income is less than $50,000 will receive a $275 payment, and couples whose combined income is less than $55,912 will get a total of $400. The one-time payments to more than three million people will cost $739 million, Girard said.
The government is also doubling an annual payment for low-income people over the age of 70, from $200 to $400. About 709,000 people will benefit, Girard said."
This could be good policy IF they also correspondingly massively raised taxes on middle and high income earners far in excess of what they are paying out to low income earners. In that way money gets taken out of circulation somewhat.
Without tax increases on some other group this as we all know will just make inflation worse.
Your welcome from Alberta.
lmfao, where do they come up with this shit
No but it does fight the effects of inflation on the poorest people which is what they are claiming to do as per the article and the actual legislation.  Changing the global economy (since inflation is basically worldwide at this point)  might be hard for the Quebec government to do.   They can try to make it slightly easier on the most vulnerable.
It would make it worse if they had to print more for it. But they don't. So its okay.
It'll soften its effects on the most vulnerable.
All good, Alberta will pay for it
Made possible by $13B a year in equalization
[deleted]
Are you complaining too when the stock market is soaring because peoples will use that money to buy stuff?
Can we see that unsold lumber used in the Canadian markets to build more affordable housing for Canadians instead???
Democrats and Republicans. Two sides of the same coin when it comes to dumb trade wars.
Retaliate you cowards.
Sometimes you have to punch the bully square in the face, even if he is bigger than you. In the short term you will probably get beat up, but in the future the bully will go after easier targets.
That only hurts Americans. Trump did the same thing and ruined many American industries. Tariffs only hurt the countries that are imposing them.
Oh this whole thing again. Back to the WTO I guess. How many times is this?
free trade for me but not for thee
Biden is really beginning to look a lot like Trump.
This shit again, USA?
Would this lead to cheaper wood at home? With higher duties going into the US market, presumably it would mean less demand, which would (in theory) create more supply on our side of the border, leading to lower prices here. Or... no?
This is all a non issue as we send our logs out uncut anyways and all the softwood that’s here is so FN expensive it’s designed to stop you from building, not to mention all those sawmills that were hastily constructed in the last few years down south they don’t even need to buy wood from us anymore we taught them how and our best workers showed them how to make it. The funniest part of “Canada selling out” is that the public is always the last to find out, the most outraged and the most powerless. This all happened by 2019. I used to work at the pulp mill in Mackenzie on the maintenance crew and I’d constantly hear from other welders about this shit, then the next thing you know all the sawmills shutdown and all the logs go on trains. Town is fuckin dead now.
Where's everyone blaming Trump this time? crickets? Where's the Biden hate?
That doesn't sound very free markety to me.
This would be an awesome time for a Canada first campaign. We can’t help the world if these people cripple our economy.
Every couple of years it's the same shit with the Americans , surely we can find another country that wants our lumber without all this bullshit
Attack intellectual property. Screw their patents.
Us citizens will just pay more now to keep their own lumber alive. 5 years later Canada will win suit, give money to mills, and repeat all over. The US can’t subsidize lumber like they do farming so this is their only possibility to keeping a local lumber supply incase Canada would for some reason implode.
It seems every 3rd year with steel and every second for softwood American's place tariffs  on them. How many times has this gone to the WTO now?
So much for the USMCA
Pro Biden Canadian in hiding/shambles right now
Well he's helping Trudeaus climate change plan by cutting fewer trees in Canada.  I'd be surprised if this minority government objects.
wonder if they'll be clawing back all the corporate welfare we handed out to companies who raised executive bonuses and fired employees... my guess is not
Corporate socialism at it's finest
>The government sent $2,000 payments to some recipients who applied through Service Canada as an advance on the first four weeks to help households who saw sudden loss of earnings.
>The idea was to reconcile the payment at some point during the time CERB was available, which is why many who got the advance saw a break in benefits during the summer of 2020.
>The government now says there are still recipients who owe some or all of the $2,000, specifically those who were not entitled to the aid or didn't collect CERB for at least 20 weeks.
Don't spend money that isn't yours and earned by you.
This is old news: i got slapped with $2000 claw-back, *over a year ago!* I paid it and got on with life.
I've been waiting for mine to come through for a while. It's been nice seeing my account artificially inflated but I held off on the urge to spend it. Called a couple times about giving it back last year and was told to wait.
CERB will be restarted once the Omicron variant rips through north america in a month.
I got a T4 saying I took 2 payments when I only took one. I still haven't been able to get through to CRA to clear it up.
I guess they have been forgiven, that is very long time ago
What exactly is meant by “those who didn’t collect it for at least 20 weeks” in the article? A lot of people received only a couple months worth of payments in which they were actually eligible for and then stopped applying for payments upon returning to work, increasing their hours etc. I just don’t understand why this would have anything to do with needing to repay the amounts received.
Not an issue if you dumped it into Gamestop.
Why would they? If CEWS was used according to the rules nothing would be clawed back.
Executive bonuses doesn't mean CEWS was abused.
This is such a lazy typical Reddit comment
yeah i remember i had a payments cut in half at one point.
Link doesn’t work
Unrelated to the current repayment. The ones last year were for people who claimed CERB from both Service Canada and the CRA. 
This one is explicitly about Service Canada collecting $2000 advance from those who didn't collect CERB for long enough for the advance payment to balance out.
How did they notify you btw?
LOL, keep dreaming. GET A JOB.
There was a $2000 advance paid by Service Canada in the beginning. It was anticipated they would have balanced it out later by withholding a future payment (which they did in Summer 2020 for those still collecting). For those who weren't still collecting at the week 16 to 20 mark, Service Canada never got the chance to balance it out, so these people still owe the advance $2000 back.
In April 2020? I agree it wouldn't be an issue if one did that.
Unlike yours, right?
Even as a conservative (note the small c), I've got to say Rex is just a little bit completely insane.
That said, our duly elected federal government does have a few valid questions to answer about their response to this imminent crisis.
Says the guy who won't be alive long enough to need to worry about it.
Rex Murphy is usually terrible but this is delusional even for him. Just no grip on reality at all.
Is it possible for Rex to get worse?
Apparently so.
Imagine listening to an out of touch fossil like Rex Murphy
Damn.  Rex has lost it lol
Good god, this fucking guy cant see beyond his own nose because of his hatred for Trudeau
The Earth is not in danger, Rex gets that right. But to think the human species is not in danger, is next level stupid. Stick your head in the sand all you want, climate change is not going away. Species are going extinct at an unprecedented rate. But you know the *planet* will be fine.
Angry mouthpiece says what?
*This propaganda piece sponsored by the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers
Fun Fact: Big polluters like using shills and hacks to change the narrative away from them and onto everyone else. Check out your "[carbon footprint](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/aug/23/big-oil-coined-carbon-footprints-to-blame-us-for-their-greed-keep-them-on-the-hook)" and curbside "[recycling](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/11/897692090/how-big-oil-misled-the-public-into-believing-plastic-would-be-recycled)".
Rex Murphy is being paid handsomely to poison to your children.
I always knew that Rex Murphy was starting to lose it, but it seems here that he's gone full Conrad Black and gone completely and irreversibly insane. 
What used to be a thoughtful, measured man whose polemics were backed by a strong commitments to facts and thought out arguments have no given way to crap like this shitty column. Broad, sweeping statements without foundation, circular reasoning, and tired old "IF GLOBAL WARMING IS REAL WHY IS IT COLD OUTSIDE HUH LIBTARD??" arguments that even kids in junior high could answer. It's actually really sad to see him this way now.
Well he is correct by saying that the earth is not in danger.
What is in danger, and that is what the conservatives do not want to talk about, is that with the current trajectory this planet **will be uninhabitable**.  Now this will not affect us tomorrow but wait another 30 years.
When I need to ask what a toilet brush thinks I’ll be sure to circle back to this.
Wow. I'm not exposed to this guy very often but he reads like the equivalent of Don Cherry for political pundits. Awful.
I swear Rex Murphy has dementia or something, this guy is delusional...
Rex Murphy has less coherent thoughts than my 6 year old nephew.
Rex Murphy is a grumpy old man. His intelligence is decaying as fast as his saggy shrivelled up body.
He does have a point. Why cant all the talking heads and their minions come to an agreement at the latest opulent Gabfest called cop26?
Countries that participated, are burning more coal, polluting more and raping the land. Sounds like a global emergency. 
The mixed signals is not what you do in an emergency,  if there is one?
I have a feeling everyone ITT either didnt read a single word from the article or came to the article already "primed" with negativity toward the author.
Aside from hyperbolic language which is Rex's hallmark and witty observations, the guy is making a salient point that is most likely true - all that nonsense with "Earth is in danger" is peak Trudeau preformative theatrics. 
I mean, it would be funny if it wasn't actually dangerous because this is YOUR Government. 
So, instead of having a speech that addresses Canadian problems - "local" issues - they decide to go with "Earth". And instead of being angry with your own Government delusions, everyone harps on delusions of the article author. 
At one point you have to realize something about Trudeau, you've been had and continue to be.
But, no, let's shit on the old man.
The old man who might be yelling at the clouds but can still deliver funny shit like no other 
> And who could doubt that if the Earth, all of it, was in danger, that **Ottawa, the world’s most respected apocalypse early warning site**, would be the first to know, and a Liberal throne speech, if I may, would send out the needed bat signal to the rest of the world.
>Which, to my mind anyway, raises this question. If our Earth really is in danger, shouldn’t the House of Commons stay in full, all-member, attendance day and night till it isn’t? Or was that five-word scream just a slogan of the moment, one not meant to live up to the emergency it declared? Was it, far more likely, just a vast and hollow distraction from — shall we say — more local, more “in-Canada” problems, problems for which the Liberal government has real responsibility to deal with and fix.
And if they did start trying to do something seriously about climate change would you shut up then old man?
or would you whine about that too
A cost we will transfer directly to US consumers. Good job America, you continue to screw your own people.
Biden is worse for Canada than Trump was. It’s amusing that everyone was having a meltdown over trump, but with Biden it’s ok.
This old song and dance yet again is it?
hopefully this makes houses in canada cheaper to build.  the trees are still growing at the same rate they were last year.
Hah!  Days after Trudeau claimed to have had a great meeting with Joe Biden about "america first" policies, etc.
When are we going to wake up an realise the American's aren't our friends anymore and start diversifying our economy? Relying on the US to buy our exports isn't working anymore.
Canada isn't "donating campaign contributions" to US politicians. You know, the way real capitalism works.
Based Biden
The funniest part of the entire dispute
from the wiki about the dispute
>On August 24, 2020, the WTO issued its report,\[48\] which the U.S. subsequently appealed\[49\] on September 28. However, there was no one at the WTO to appeal to, since the U.S. had blocked appellate vacancies.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada%E2%80%93United\_States\_softwood\_lumber\_dispute
Such a silly battle considering our lumber is better, cheaper, and more abundant.  Keep up the good fight Joe.  Canadians appreciate the new decks and renovations.
Maybe we can use this lumber to build houses here
And here we go again.
This is only designed to make it more difficult for Canadian sawmills to remain profitable
... please don't discount the lumber to the U.S, and then pass the cost on to Canadians!
Ooof, not a good day if your a pro Biden Canadian
i love what sleepy joe is doing to canada /s
Justin and Joe have a special relationship.  Thank goodness we weren't getting the treatment that The Donald handed out to us.
Yeah, for about 6 months until our sawmills move to their side of the border. The US is trying to build its industry by not relying on foreign imports.    
You'd think they'd exempt us from this strategy, like they did with the steel/aluminum tariff, but I guess not.
Americans aren’t the ones being screwed when it comes to lumber and housing.
No he's not, if Trump was in power we'd be negotiating NAFTA again and the CPC would be yelling give him everything he want's Again.  
The US is not our friend, we need to adapt and get used to their increased instability, look at their political and social landscape down there, it's pretty much predicated on volatility now to function for the rich, this will become more common not less, we need to start adapting to it now, start duty's on their retailers, alcohol makers, non essential products and more importantly services.   We also need to get rid of our own regulatory capture that is holding back small business, this means less duty on items or import oligopoly breaking for importers from China whether you like it or not, it's where most of our consumer shit is made.   Our patent laws need to change and open up more opportunity for Canadian business.  
Globalization combined with increased nationalism has made the world exponentially more complicated and faster paced, time to work on strategies to deal with that.
Biden’s job isn’t to take care of Canada or let Canada kick him around. Welcome to recognizing these are separate countries with individual goals.
Schedule; fill a few sandbags, elbow bump with some soldiers, pretend to listen as a farmer tells him how their life is runined followed by a patronising insincere lecture to the working poor about how they are contributing to climate change then jump back in the jet for a few days vacation.
Fly his private jet to BC to tell them about how climate change caused this so we should all stop driving cars and stop eating meat while he continues to fly a private jet and eat steaks.
I guess parliament is back in session - time to make himself scarce.
Surf's up!
I don’t understand why politicians do this. 
Let the people focus on the recovery effort. He will only be a distraction and detract people from working on the task at hand, as well as pulling resources so he is looked after while he is there.
Is he bringing his surfboard?
Stay home Justin, we don’t want you here.
“Surfs up” - Tredeau probably
completely useless so called leader.
He’s flying almost 10 days later? Stay home! It’s too late.
Trudeau can go fuck himself
Imagine if he showed up in work clothes, demanded that the cameras be shut off, and actually spent a day really working, not what his cheerleaders call working, but really working, with these people. It would be a whole new level of respect, but that's not what he is about. Pick up a sandbag, camera flash, and hes out of there
Seeing as how the Three Amigos meeting was an utter failure for Canada. We are in fact worse off as a result of the meeting. He desperately needs some good news and photo opps to try and get his image back in track. And no better time to do than when he’s supposed to be in Ottawa actually doing his job.
What an utter waste of jet fuel.
I’m sure there will be enough time for Trudeau to make a quick pit stop in Tofino or Whistler.
Going to throw Scott paper towels to the crowd.
Surf's up?
Cant miss a photo op like that! Gonna get a selfie with the poors then sell their farms to a chinese pension fund for luxury condo development
Time for that virtue signaling f**k to pretend like he understands :)
There's no point for politicians to be visiting disaster zones unless they actually live there. They can do all they need to do from their office, them being there only causes commotion and takes attention away from relief efforts.
What surprises me most is that Suzuki still has a voice and followers. The guy is the biggest hypocrite in Canadian history. Preaches saving the ecosystem and tries to guilt everyone into reducing their carbon footprint while he has multiple homes, vehicles, asshole attitude towards "fans" and pervy nature towards young women. This has been known for like 10-20 years now, yet people are still listening to him.
I feel I should also apologize for saying David Suzuki will be 'set adrift on an ice floe' if he keeps acting like this.
I suppose that's the nature of these things.
He's been attending Trudeau school. Do/say whatever you want, just apologize later.
Too late - damage done.
I feel like this did a massive amount of damage to his reputation. What an asinine thing to have said
Jason Kenney calling for David Suzuki to be cancelled.
That's fucking rich.
Nothing like apologizing for encouraging terrorism….  
But as long as he’s sorry, I suppose we should just forgive and forget
Weak.
I think the issue is the "who" said this and how many people it reached.  If it was a nobody who said this no big deal.  But even if taken out of context because it was said from a person who is highly regarded by many it was not only a stupid thing to say but extremely dangerous especially in this day and time.
Well, there you have it. 
It official. 
He apologized. 
All is forgotten and forgiven.
>Any suggestion that violence is inevitable is wrong.
&#x200B;
Consider how David Suzuki was pressured in to making such a ludicrous absolute statement as this. Pressured by corporations, by the governments and media they keep in their pockets, and the brainless stooges they can manipulate \*cough cough\*. If they can hold David Suzuki under their thumb like that, they can certainly do the same to you should it become in their interest.  
David had spoken openly and truthfully about a likely future outcome, and now in response they have shown us what the other side of that coin looks like.
[removed]
Well, good. It was bad way to phrase something. We've all phrased things poorly at times. Apology accepted. Now we can moved on.
...right?
The woke got to him. That was never what he meant.
Fair enough. We all say dumb things sometimes. Let's move on.
Are talking about Justin or David?
In your defence, you weren't inciting anything - you were just making a prediction.
He's not our buddy, guy
David Suzuki was right and people are so emotional about it.
What should he say about what is happening and escalating?
“As ecocide continues globally and countries destabilize with yearly disastrous life altering economy testing  weather disasters people will hug eachother about it”
not enough context
doesn't name the race of the shooter what does that mean?
I really hope it’s not connected to this lady https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7ddgm/qanons-queen-of-canada-calls-for-followers-to-kill-people-vaccinating-children and that her terrorist innsurection hasn’t kicked off.

**Control. The. Fucking. Border.**
Even the Quebec politicians, who are super into gun bans, are begging the federal government to do its job. The problem isn't legal guns, it's smuggling across the border.
It won't work.
Gun crime in Canada is almost exclusively committed with illegally owned guns, many of which are banned models. The main problem is a black market from the United States.
This is to be expected from centrists like the LPC, they love to play lip service to issues while ignoring any amount of solution. This is a transparent power grab, and everyone regardless of their opinion on guns and gun crime should be opposed to it.
“Illegal guns are flowing over the border!  Is that the problem?”
“No, law abiding gun owners in Canada are the problem!”
Dennis R. Young, an Alberta-based researcher who filed a Freedom of Information request with the Toronto police and published their reply on his website. And these stats tell a very different story.
In short, there is no surge in crime guns that can be traced back to licensed Canadian gun owners. 
"roughly half of the crime guns seized by Toronto police in 2017 were classified under Canadian law as “prohibited,” meaning they are virtually banned and only rarely possessed by any Canadian civilian (the only real exceptions are Canadians who owned said firearms before the current gun control classification system was introduced in the 1990s). Any kind of further crackdown on gun ownership in Canada would have extraordinarily limited impact on these guns, which, again, were half the crime guns seized in Toronto in 2017"

[Almost all illegal guns coming into Mississauga and Brampton are from the U.S.](https://www.insauga.com/almost-all-illegal-guns-coming-into-mississauga-and-brampton-are-from-the-us/)
Maybe we should target this ban at illegal guns, and make them super illegal.  Is that how you get the cops to enforce gun laws we already have?
WE CANT AFFORD TO LIVE AND THIS IS WHAT YOU FOCUS ON? This won’t even have an effect on gun violence in any way. This is basically gas lighting at this point.
This does not make any sense. Since the largest gun ban in Canadian history, violent gun crime has increased greatly. They have previously stated that the large majority of guns used in violent crimes are coming illegally from the US.
Guns legally purchased in Canada are very rarely used to commit a crime. So how does continuing to remove guns not used in crimes, from law abiding citizens, stop anything?
How does that stop the flow of illegal guns coming from the US, overwhelmingly being used to commit most gun crimes in Canada? Just curious. Cause it is honestly starting to seem like a really easy way to just take as many guns away from citizens as possible. Why would they want to do that?
Lmao. “We will do or try literally anything except making meaningful progress to better the lives of the average canadian. Now because we caught another person smuggling guns over the border we are giving the provinces the power to ban safety scissors” 
What a fucking joke.
Edit: and I’m glad that this is basically an admission that the AR ban a year or so ago basically made no fucking difference, which is exactly what everyone who knew anything about anything said would happen but ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
"“The refrain of wanting to ‘work with any province that wants to get handguns off the streets’ is basically the federal government saying it has no intention of legislating to counter the proliferation of legal handguns and will rely on provinces to do the heavy lifting, **despite the fact that not one provincial government has indicated any interest in doing so**,” said Rathjen."
From the Star article  on the same announcement.
https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/2021/11/24/ottawa-looks-to-provinces-to-impose-bans-on-handguns.html
This country is going to shit
How is banning legal guns going to prevent illegal guns? They’ve flat out said most illegal handguns are smuggled in from the US.
Me: Not a hunter, I own no handguns and I'm a bit center politically.
We shouldn't ban handguns.  We should increase penalties for people caught with illegal handguns.  I'm talking serious jail time.
People that are following *legal* means to own handguns shouldn't be penalized for crime that's taking place with illegal handguns.
Fixing poverty will do more for reducing gun violence than any gun control measure could ever hope to achieve.
Illegal guns will now become even more illegal. Surely this will solve the problem.
Good thing we don't have other massive and pressing problems.
Can someone keep Trudeau's Liberals away from gun legislation until they prove they can hit a target.  This guy is constantly firing off into a crowd of innocent bystanders.
Introducing legislation for firearm laws at the provincial level is just passing the buck down the line.  Provinces can't afford to buy legally owned firearms at purchase price.  If you also consider legislation introduced by the Liberals has been rife with loopholes I'm sure it will actually allow banning of other items such as nailguns.
Criminals involved in gun violence don't care about laws, they never have ( that's what makes them criminals ).  Look at how many people are killed with knives, bludgeoning weapons and alcohol.  People have been killing people since we could pick up a rock, the problem is never the tools, only the people wielding them.
Gun violence is a serious problem in major Canadian cities. Addressing this problem will require leadership at the federal level working together with other levels of government. What Trudeau has proposed is, yet again, feel-good legislation that accomplishes nothing. Tokenism and virtue-signalling aren’t enough. Passing the buck to provinces and municipalities won’t be enough. Increase penalties/sentences for gun crimes, invest in social programs that get kids off the street, invest in intelligence operations at the border and detection methods.
The point is that even the feds know that chasing a handgun ban on a national level is ridiculous. PolySeSouvient has complained about as much, citing laziness or lack of a spine on Trudeau's part to essentially punish those who did nothing wrong.
There isn't enough support, money, or want to enact a handgun ban, and most of the Conservative provinces have already told the federal government to go fuck themselves, which means Quebec and Ontario are the only provinces asking for this. Checkmate.
Oh my fuck this again??? When someone gets shot with a handgun, how often is it by a licensed individual? Literally never. Taking my locked up handgun away from me will not do a single god damn thing to help anyone.
What is banning hand guns going to do to stop or slow gun violence?
Another great satire from The Beaverton!  🦫
Damn Walmart, my kid has been asking for the polish drug cartel  toy for 3 months, how am I supposed to explain this to them ?
Seriously where can I get one... Honestly being serious.
>"It's about taking five grams of cocaine and being alone … It's a very depressing song," Tanner said
So... it's a typical Polish folk song then. Good on Walmart for celebrating Polish culture this way.
It's the dancing cow song, that's hilarious
That's too bad, that'd be perfect for my swearing cocaine doing son.
>"It's about taking five grams of cocaine and being alone … It's a very depressing song,"
Kids have to learn sometime.
Now I want one that sings in English.
🤣🤣
Just the straight forward way this title is written is awesome.  Damn near spit out my soup haha.
Truly hilarious to have a drug-loving, depressed cactus singing about his struggles! 🎤🌵🎶
Did anyone manage to get one? I will buy it from you, name your price.
Polish cow?
This would be a great gift for my Polish sister-in-law.
How many KURWA per minute
Rofl...I want it.
Hasn't this been reported at least twice now?
I want one
this is hilarious
"The perfect toy doesn't exhi---"
Damnit I rly wanted that toy when I heard of it.
Day late etc, I guess.
Nothing good ever happens in vanderhoof
Good for them, I watched that whole fiasco closely and those people are treated like dirt, I'll happily eat more veggies for a while while they strike.
Good, and fuck this company. It’s absolutely sick how this company takes advantage of immigrants.
I hope 2 things come out of this.
1 they get better working conditions n stuff. 
2 they learn to drive better. I drive past this plant every day. The amount of questionable driving decisions made would shock you!
They screw the farmers and the consumers as well.
*the corporation screws the farmers and consumers as well.
Don't forget that the decisions of a corporation that brings in *tens of billions in revenue* each year is much more impactful on the Canadian economy than the exploited workers that are just trying to get by like everyone else.
Whoosh.
Care to explain?
Initial comment >good for **them** 
~Refering to strikers
Next comment >they screw... 
~Also refering (presumably) to the strikers
And then I point out that we should place blame on the relatively powerful corps instead of the relatively weak strikers - what exactly is the whoosh here?
LOL. Y'all are a real jobsworth, aren't you? Bet you're a real blast at parties.
Sure sure.
Canada's climate change efforts are bull shit. We are hindering our economic growth because the poorly educated in Canada think we can power the place with windmills.
If we wanted to take climate change and economics seriously, we would be building nuclear reactors right now. We aren't.
There are efforts?
Something most of us who pay attention have known all along.
When does the government not fail? If I was this bad at my job I would have been fired ages ago. Yet these goons are still in office. That goes for the left and right.
>While implementation of Canada's current climate plans may fulfil Canada's initial 2030 target of a 30 per cent reduction below 2005 levels
That's actually quite positive. Getting to 30% by 2030 would be a success in my books.
I'm sure enjoying the action with my Suncor and CNRL stocks. If it's any consolation - oil makes this country rich. Oil isn't going away any time soon. As good as people around the world would like to feel about themselves- bread and butter will always be more important than feelings.
Am I the only person who remembers when the shift from paper bags to plastic was done to combat climate change?
Or am I just old?
It's almost like the climate change 2030 target was load of shit to sell to naïve progressives for their vote. Oh wait, it was.
Good. We need to prioritize our economy and job creation instead of trying to solve an impossible problem caused by China and India
Canada has the worst record in CO2 for the G7 from 2015 onward. It's almost like Carbon taxes don't work and direct action is needed
This is exactly it. The entire world needs to transition to nuclear as swiftly as possible, or humanity is fucked.
Wind absolutely can power all of Canada - there’s enough wind to go around. Just like there’s enough coal or uranium or gas. All we need is for liberals to actually pick something instead of letting the climate balance itself.
To bad our new Minister of Climate Change thinks nuclear needs to be left to the market while they manipulate O&G markets. For any Canadian outside of BC, Quebec or Ontario your electric car is powered by diesel or coal.
[Independent modelling](https://cleanprosperity.ca/liberal-climate-plan-has-reasonable-chance-of-meeting-2030-target/) shows that the Liberal's climate policies give them a reasonable chance of reaching the Paris target if implemented quickly and prioritized accordingly. Households earning less than $86,000 will be better off because of the carbon tax rebates. The biggest hurdle is really just getting the provinces like Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Ontario on board and on the same page, as they hold jurisdiction over their energy sectors and are [dragging their feet](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/climate-change-emissions-canada-provinces-1.6112781). 
No need to disparage or misrepresent the facts. Nuclear is fine, but it is by no means the only solution and should not be represented as some sort of silver bullet which fixes our situation while leaving oil and gas well-enough alone.
Yeah that was gonna be my question too.
According this, yes, just not enough.
>The commissioner's office says that, in the past, Canada's stated climate targets have not been backed by strategies to follow through.
>
>"While implementation of Canada's current climate plans may fulfil Canada's initial 2030 target of a 30 per cent reduction below 2005 levels, Canada now has a new, more ambitious goal of 40 per cent to 45 per cent. Therefore, the government will have to revisit the plans, policies, and actions needed to achieve the new targets," says one of the reports.
>
>…
>The commissioner said that while recent legislation, such as the Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act and the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, represent progress, more must be done.
>
>"Parliament … must intensify efforts in the fight against climate change to make up for decades of missed opportunities and missteps," the report said.
We stall some pipelines once in a while.
Roads. Garbage. Water. Etc.
Great plan dude, it’s not like climate change has any tangible effect on peoples’ lives, let’s just ignore it!

How to Make a Slum 101
Anything to avoid getting people clean.
*Costs ranged from $40,000 to build what would essentially be a sleeping pod, with ventilation, lights and heat to $80,000 for a self-contained tiny home with a kitchen and washroom. In both scenarios, an additional $40,000 would be required for site preparation and servicing.*
WTF
Brazilians would call it a favela.
Y'all hate everything. 
Complain about all the homeless
Then complain about potential solutions to a problem
Then complain that nothing happened
I could see it working if they had strict regulations/minimum requirements and rules about upkeep similar to a hoa or something otherwise it'd be a shit show shanty town.
District 9?
Like a mini-trailer park.  How quaint!
No shanty towns needed-Thanks.
Vancouver is a tiny house village - for most people, and something else for the homeless.
More freebies for junkies while adding more tax to hard working folks. No thanks.There are enough freebies already.
In the worlds 2nd largest country, it really didnt need to get to this stage. Shows how stupid Canadians are in managing their resources. Give it all away!
But they're so tiny! and cute!
Yeah, I wonder if there will be HOA's to enforce architectural covenants and landscaping requirements etc. Why not just cut out the unnecessary need to bring in the homes and just manufacture on site with corrugated tin sheets perhaps? I've seen this in Asian countries, very progressive, front door transit and SkyTrain access as well.
I wanna see the Canadian version of Slumdog Millionaire.
I thought spreading them around the city prevented this?
It will be a tiny version of escape from LA
This helps people get clean. Having a real place to stay is good for recovery.
So, you don't see this turning into a shit hole?
Care for some cat food?

Amazing news!
You mean, Whitehorse, Yukon?
Toronto to Yellowknife as well, starting May 2022. https://cabinradio.ca/80148/news/travel/air-north-launches-direct-flights-from-yellowknife-to-toronto/
Great, I have always wanted to visit. The Yukon would be amazing to explore. Wild country put there.
Getting to Canada's far north will now be a whole lot easier. 👍🏾😎🧊
Great news.
Oh yay more people from Ontario coming to the Yukon.
[deleted]
[deleted]
It'll likely be closer to ~$800.
Whitehorse to Vancouver is a route flown daily seasonally by Air North. If you include Air Canada, there can be 3-4 flights between Vancouver and Whitehorse *per day*. Whitehorse/Yellowknife to Ottawa has been around twice weekly for 7 years, and that route exists pretty much exclusively to service federal government workers.
Toronto to Whitehorse/Yellowknife is a big deal for locals. A common complaint of anyone who moves here from eastern Canada is how obnoxiously difficult it is to get back there for visiting family. Being able to fly direct to Toronto and connect immediately to pretty much anywhere in eastern North America is huge.
Not to mention it opens Whitehorse to tourism from eastern Canada too. I know people who have done 16 hour travel days to get to Whitehorse from Ontario with Air Canada, cutting that by 60% or more is a huge deal and makes it way more accessible.
Also, you'll find there isn't much in the way of "prairies" here in the Yukon.
Its well worth it I live near haines Junction atm to fly home it general takes 3 or 4 legs to get here from Edmontn is 3 legs alone
Literally everyone in the Yukon asked for this.
I lived in Whitehorse for three years and I’m from Newfoundland. Whenever I needed to fly home, I usually went some variation of Whitehorse - Vancouver - Edmonton - Toronto - Montreal - Nova Scotia - Home.
I’ve never done it in less than three legs.
Gotta get in on the WestJet Calgary to Halifax flight that's 95% Fort Mac workers going home.
You mean significantly reduce immigration volumes and boost current workers' salaries? Say it.
It’s a simple but unpopular solution - restrict speculation in residential real estate by imposing ownership limits (e.g. a maximum of one primary and one recreational property per Canadian/permanent resident). Housing shouldn’t be an investment.
there are so many unturned levers to fix this it is just sad. and sooo tired of this conversation as well... I am in this country for a decade now and the conversation has not changed. All that has is that prices throughout the country are now completely bogus, besides a few pockets of sanity.
I am just tired of it.
I'm glad Mr Pretty Socks is bringing in 400k immigrants this year. I'm selling my dumpy bungalo and building a new house. RIP young Canadians but thanks for voting for Mr Trust Fund Ski Teacher I guess
I feel like the answer is progressive taxation. Increase the taxes paid on additional properties until it gets to a point that hoarding homes isn’t profitable.
Reduce immigration.
Do that.
You have to reduce immigration to solve this problem. And no, it is not racist to say that.
Stop importing an unsustainable level of people. Stop allowing people not even in the country to buy homes and real estate. Address the need for affordable housing, mental health and addiction care, and quality of life for those here. It’s not rocket science but increasing the quality of life rather than just quantity of crappy jobs and prospects, while devoid of benefits and care, would actually address the housing and homeless crisis.
Reduce immigration, tax investment properties in triple digits and watch that shit correct.
Address massively under construction of supply also.
Weve been doing demand side shit for years with minimal effect
Want to solve the housing crisis? Electrical majority in Canada, Justin Trudeau, Liberal Party: No. Housing IS an investment and you can get in on the action too!
Top post just means the ppl with many are grandfathered in and none of us get a chance to compete… idiot
And stop companies from scooping up multiple properties. Change taxes to disincentivize the commoditization of housing. Actually do something about money laundering. Reduce real estate agency’s hold and monopoly on information and over individual agents.
It’s sort of a bunch of problems rolled into one. Bringing in a bunch of new people that will need housing when there’s already a crunch is one of the several pressure points.
I doubt they’ll do Jack squat about any of this. They don’t want to, it’s apparent by the platforms all of the parties put out during the election. They’d have a small real impact and just give the perception something’s being done, to shut us all up.
Gotta love PM Zoolander

Should do the match in Nunavut for some tactical advantage.
This country is too damn big, geographically speaking.
>Until recently, the purest water in the world was believed to be that trapped thousands of years ago in Arctic ice. But in 2006, Shotyk and colleagues discovered water from his farm had a lead concentration five times lower than Arctic core samples – a result he still finds mind-boggling. At the time, there were only a handful of facilities in the world that could measure a lead concentration so low.
>“This is not great water. This is not excellent water. This water is absolutely unique. This is a miracle of nature,” he said. “But we don’t understand how much water is there, where it’s coming from, how quickly it’s moving, where it’s going to and how Mother Nature created it.”
So how come Nestle isn't up there sucking it dry?
Government:  who cares, just a tiny town.
Ugh I’m from around here and the water is just so darn good. I bring jars of it home from my parents well and we used to stop at a free water spring (a hose on the side of the highway) by tiny on hot summer days.
What a misleading headline. It doesn’t have the “world’s purest water”.
As someone whose family has a cottage up there I can say this: the protestors need to change their motto. ‘The puts the pits’ is way better.
For 1 Nestle sold most of its bottled water companies. For a second nestle has never sucked any place dry. For a third the water is not actually that pure.
The elmvale spring? I always thought the water tasted like farts a bit.
No, it does. This water hasn’t had sex with a soul.
And for a fourth, the marketing on it is kind of tricky. mountain springs and glacier water sell themselves, but a bottle of Tiny water doesn't sound super appealing. Sounds more like some juvenile meme than a refreshing beverage.
No,the one on the side of highway 12 by matchedash bay? I should look at a map my memory is failing me. I know the spring your talking about too, would pass it on the back way to wasaga and I agree, not great hah.
Lmfao great comment
Thank you for the laugh

The system works!
I love it when idiots filter themselves out of civilized society.
Its apparently a township of like 300 people.  Who cares?  They'll find another guy.  You have more people to look after by becoming the student body present of many high schools than this guy did.
*Former Northern Ontario mayor announces candidacy for the Conservative Party of Canada*
Meh. With such low empathy and intellect, couldn't have been that great a mayor.
The guy left a position he held for 11 years because he would have had to act against his principles. Takes a lot of guts.  And of course every commenter here is giving him shit since they have never, and probably will never, be put in such a scenario.
Yeah...he looks like someone who'd protest common sense.
Good riddance
Good. Let a sane guy take over.
But what will the town do now!  Without mayor whatshisname they will have to choose someone who can follow the rules of a democratically elected council
Bye
Don't let the door hit you on the way out (keep safe and healthy)
Good. Fuck him. He's not fit to lead.
Well that's a relief to the majority of his constituents.  Hope we don't read about him dying of covid a few weeks from now.
He even got a free doctor's note saying he has a medical condition that prevents him from getting vaccinated
It would be nice to have an MP that values the individual and sticks to their principles.
He held the position for 11 years, couldn't have been that bad.
What an ironic post from you lmfao
So should you admire someone for sticking to their principles, even if their principles are based on nonsense? I don't get it.

“Even though”
I mean - that’s cool language for 5th grade satire. But just use “despite” if you want to be remotely mature. 
Beaverton is low IQ (mostly liberal) fodder
“I was extra firm when I opened the schools,” Ford said. “I looked Covid in the eye and I pointed at those kids running around without masks and I said, ‘Pleeeeease staaaahp infecting them! Those aren’t for you, those are for the workforce!’ I couldn’t have been more of a gentleman.”
"I'm counting on the numbers of Ontario to do the right thing."
Wouldn't it be nice if we had disposable or reusable home tests so we could actually know if someone was an asymptotic spreader?
There are benefits to invisible hysteria though.
How many children have died from COVID in all of Canada?  How many are in the ICU?  How many of passes it on to another person?
But that doesn't matter, you see. Children are there to be sacrificed like human shields for the eldest generation. It only took 5-11 years to raise that child, but grandma has 80 years! That's a lot of investment we can't lose.
If they hid his death what else are they hiding! 
:/
This isn’t the first time they hid willie’s death
It was an assassination
He was just trying to keep people from losing hope about the impending eternal winter.
So, does that mean 6 more years of winter?
Why not have him cloned?  You can do a dog for 50k and a cat for 35k.  Honestly, it's a pretty small potatoes problem.  A cloned groundhog would probably be an international headline for Wiarton too.  Has anyone asked how global warming is going to affect this tradition?
WE DEMAND THE DEATH CERTIFICATE!!!
My old P.E. teacher used to play a game called hide the willy.
I remember when they had to announce his death and held a funeral as they couldn't find another albino groundhog in time for groundhogs day. If I remember correctly, they are always searching for albino groundhogs as they have a short lifespan and they would regularly replace them without saying anything.
[We will stay with the story all night if we have to!](https://youtu.be/huiuUxdBmKw?t=12)
Mine did this Magic trick where he’d stand behind and put a finger in my butt but then would extend his hand to show all me all his fingers but I could still feel the finger in my butt. Incredible trick.
Did you volunteer?
Yeah, this groundhog seems to die like every five years. I seriously don’t know why they haven’t started their own albino farm yet 🤣

I'll bet they also have super high levels of "value for money" too.
It’s now a hugely competitive market with zero QA/QC enforcement - what do you expect?
PS: the “non-illicit” legal pot ain’t no better for the exact same reason.
Eh, grow your own or buy from a reputable MoM ( there are lots of good ones ) more propaganda to try to get people to buy the governments awful irradiated terpless weed.
Oh, so the same as the “legal market” 🤔
This isn't really something that wasn't known, it's just ignored in the face of lower prices by folks that don't really care what they put in thier body.
This is why I buy legal weed.
I simply don't understand why so many don't grow it at home, hell even if you don't smoke it grow it and give it to people for Christmas/Birthdays or those that need it for medicinal, I barely smoke myself maybe 1/2oz a year yet I grow pounds of it with 4 plants (mind you my wife smokes it as well but less than a QP a year).
I don't find this surprising at all.
Yes, exactly the same. The difference is how much above the safe limit, and how many legal growers have been found using it? Not many I guess, or it'd be big news
> _Myclobutanil—often marketed as Nova 40, or Eagle 20—is a very common pesticide used on cannabis in the illicit market. Although safe in low levels for some food production, it has many negative health effects associated with its heating and inhalation. A few Health Canada licensed commercial growers have faced fines, recalls, and penalties for being caught with far lower levels in the past_
All weed is legal
Because a lot of people live on condos, or rented homes, or urban settings that make it difficult to do without busy bodies sticking their nose in others business. 
There’s also a lot of odor in the harvesting curing process.
Not everyone lives in the same environment.
Same reason most people don't make their own booze despite it being cheap and easy.
Time has a value.
It's worth coming up with a price for your free time, and including that price any time you're trying to save money doing something yourself.
Space also has a value, most people have limited space to set up for it.
Because I live in a small townhouse with two kids and only smoke concentrates?
It's pretty cheap to get set up (especially for heavy smokers) it's an investment that pays for itself.
Grow tent and carbon filter takes care of the smells, that said if you don't have the space you don't have the space it's as simple as that but not everyone lives in the Toronto, there's tonnes of rural people out there that could grow and don't, maybe in the future it'll become more widespread, if places like Canadian Tire or Greenhouses sold clones in the spring I could guarantee growing it would explode.
Canadian Tire Kush LOL
For those with outdoor spaces it's not very time consuming at all especially if you dish out a few bucks and get a smart watering system, even indoor with the right setup it's pretty time free, I just have to mix water/nutrients once a week for my indoor, one major defoliation and I'm done until harvest.
They're just plants average people across Canada grow plants.
I do like your last point. There’s so much non-thc ancillary products that would be perfectly fitting to round out Canada’s legal rec market.
Home Depot and Costco do sell grow lights at least.
So, is he? Surely the CBC must have examined the relevant record before deciding that he is not violent.
>It is not clear which police force flagged him, when or why.
Oh. So they have not seen the records and this is an article trying to smear the RCMP without any evidence at all.
Awesome quality journalism CBC, keep it up!
They steal heavy machinery to destroy public infrastructure and private property.... they sure as hell arent peaceful.
The rise of far left eco-terrorism and the seeming unwillingness to stop it is disconcerting.
I'm pretty progressive, but I feel like all this "landback" nonsense really leaves logic at the door.
They just want to draw a line in the sand and say "all hostile land takeover up to this point is okay, but subsequent to when it is convenient for me it is no longer okay".  But then they advocate for hostile land takover?
I didn't steal anyone's land. I was born here, and I paid for everything I own.  I don't need to be your enemy unless you make me.
I absolutely believe everyone should be equal, but that seems to be what separates me from the far right and the far left.  Both radical sides of the spectrum seem to think they should be held in higher regard than everyone else.  That certain rules shouldn't apply to them. That they should be granted certain privileges.  Fuck off with that.
>It is not clear which police force flagged him, when or why. 
Did he not just help take 300 people hostage?
Is it just me or is that video very edited ?
I enjoy watching these people get arrested for violating lawful court orders. Also, all the pretending that they have the support of the local community (surprise... They don't)
I wonder if it's the same guy talked about in [this](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/trio-sought-in-caledonia-beating-1.667182)
That is so weird, because I happen to have flagged the police as violent!
Huh. How about that.
Lol yeah?...
*Violent militarized police force carrying assault weapons on unceded Indigenous territory meticulously comb through multiple police databases to try to prove that this one guy might be violent too. CBC writes, "It is not clear which police force flagged him, when or why."*
Fuck it, ROLL THE PRESSES.

Police flagged as violent
I would like to submit my flag for the police as violent, and unpredictable, and corrupted by the private good.  Thanks.
I mean, we know the RCMP lied about the journalists identifying themselves, so I don't know exactly why anyone would give them the benefit of the doubt here. 
It seems like, at this point, any messaging coming from the RCMP that forwards their own narratives can be dismissed until it's proven to be true, and they only have themselves to blame.
**Edit:** Feel free to downvote, but it's a fact the cops lied already and it's a fact the journalists were allowed to be there. Aren't we a facts above feelings crowd around here?
They're not even armed for christ sakes. The RCMP are, though. Remind me who's violent again
These people have the same claim to the land as as queen of england. It isn't 1700 anymore. They have a democratically elected band and that's how it is. We need to stop playing this game, their claim is not legitimate. Their claim is the exact same as the colonial kings and queens which is hilarious. This is a democratic society.
Am I missing something? Seems like they're basing this off court records:
> Police flagged a prominent Haudenosaunee leader of the Land Back movement as "violent," **according to court records from a recent RCMP operation** to clear barricades from a road in northern B.C.
The reporting isn't super clear though. Can you shed some light as to what I'm missing?
Its really not bad journalism, just your lens you are using it to look at it. Article also lets us know they asked the RCMP for comment, who did not respond. So how could they find out if they cant access records and the RCMP didnt respond?
It also asks the question of why providing context. That the database used feeds in crimes and flaggings from other police forces, and details charges he has against him (which are non-violent). The article doesnt say it was done so incorrectly, it says with the information available they cant determine why. There isnt really an effort here to smear RCMP, no use of them in the headline or accusations against them. To see their name you have to read the article, which provides the extra context that it wasnt the RCMP themselves who flagged him.
This is quality journalism, its just not telling you your opinion so you've dismissed it as low quality.
They are all for peace and love until you don't agree with them.

Wow, I'm impressed.
Macau. But those egg tarts tho...
Nah, they have to skate on the canal, no other options.
What? 2023 maybe. They'll have to fix it properly this time.
Hope to Kamloops was built in 2 years. I'm sure they repair a couple spots quickly. It did last 35 years which isn't too bad. I could see the toll coming back thought to pay for the quick repair.
I could see one lane each direction open by January for truck traffic.  But fully open with a speed limit of 120.  No that will take longer than January.
The toll was in place because it was a P3. I think we are out of the P3 so I highly doubt they would reinstitute a toll, especially with the ndp's track record of removing tolls.
Though it took 2 years the first time, I'm certain most of the work would've taken place during the summer months. Earth works during winter are particularly challenging due to frost.
Wasn't the original a rush job for Expo? For so much to wash away it makes me wonder about the rest.

Funny how Biden is reflecting the soaring costs of gas in the USA, on Saudi Arabia and Russia.  Glad to see others taking him to task.
I'm sure Biden's tripping over himself to accommodate Manchin's wishes right now.
Seems like war room money has changed hands. Foreign funded interference.
Good
Tell Biden he'll support Build Back Better if XL is restarted.
If this gets going again I want to see Rachel Notley eat that whole crow.
Biden will become more moderate after the midterms with an eye to reelection, his only priority right now is keeping Bernie's fifth column in the Democratic Party from delivering Republican super majorities in both houses.
Hilarious
This doesn’t matter.
Manchin is just playing to his base and knows it’s done.
Manchin is very well known for looking out for the best interests of Canada and not taking money in turn for his support.
I don't think Biden even knows what day it is.
Hopefully he doesn’t change his mind
Manchin doesn't care about Keystone. This is just political posturing for the mid-term elections. West Virginia is typically Republican territory. He can't afford to lose it.
Let it die. FFS.
Beating a dead horse…
Manchin is a cancer on the country and the world. It's ridiculous that one corrupt senator can screw with the entire Biden agenda for his own blatantly self serving enrichment.
so hes had time to think about it now.
Article Highlights:
* Last week, Suzuki said  "There are going to be pipelines blown up if our leaders don’t pay attention to what’s going on.”   On Thursday, he apologized.
* But he then went on to tell the National Post that the government and police are “declaring war against those that are protesting,” and mused that there are few options available to protesters other than violence.
* This is dangerous not because any credible observer thinks Suzuki supports eco-terrorism, but because there are some members of Extinction Rebellion and other anti-pipeline movements who do.
* Genuine eco-terrorists are thankfully rare, but contempt for the rule of law is distressingly common among green activists.
* Though most of Extinction Rebellion's activities are “nonviolent” in the strict sense of the term, it advocates ignoring the law to generate attention. Its members have blockaded bridges, intersections and highways throughout the country.
* Last year, some protesters were charged after they went to the home of B.C. Premier John Horgan, in the hopes of placing him under “citizen’s arrest.” And  last month, 18 activists were arrested for blocking a major intersection leading to Vancouver International Airport.
* Just last week, RCMP arrested 29 people who had literally laid siege to a camp of workers constructing the Coastal GasLink Pipeline, cutting 500 people off from water and other essential supplies.
* Canadians have the right to engage in peaceful protest, but  Extinction Rebellion actively advocates for cities to be disrupted in order to impose financial costs on citizens and governments, and for protests that result in mass arrests.
* **When folks are led to believe it is morally justifiable to break some laws, or to hurt some individuals, it is not much of a stretch for them to think that using violence against infrastructure, or even people, is also justified.**
You’ll always have people on the far end of any bell curve.  
It’s too bad that a life long advocate of the environment and wildlife accidentally made such a terrible choice of words…. Or was it an accident?
This man who I always respected and thought highly of, needs to be on a watchlist - this feels like he is covering up a mask off moment.
They're really trying hard to make this a thing aren't they?
How completely fucking ridiculous.
Oh, what a load of steaming bullshit.
Jesus christ lol
We'd rather deal with human extinction than some blown up tubes? Sounds like our priorities are in order
The National Post in high moral indignation?  Uh-huh, spin on!! 🙄
I mean, let's say people in the future have rights. That emission of GHG fuck the future for them, infringing their rights. That emitters aren't held responsible for that. It's also pretty lawless.
Tell that to corporations.
Fair is fair, tons of people out there believe in vigilante justice when it suits them. Drunk driver killed someone on the road, kill them, etc etc etc. This is a common theme throughout humanity.
The first time, maybe it would have been appropriate to assume no malice, maybe he was simply reporting what he'd heard being said by radicals in the movement.
But the second time, so soon after the first, he's clearly dog-whistling.
What do you think happens when an active pipe filled with flowing crude or bitumen or whatever other substance, gets blown up? Where do you think the hazardous contents goes?  
Will the saboteurs also be placing down a few hundred thousand pounds of petroleum absorber before they blow it up? lmao
A *tiny* bit of critical thinking goes a long way.

Until the green activists get past their opposition to nuclear energy they don't have the moral or ethical high ground imo. We have the ability to transition to zero emissions power generation and they're refusing to accept it.
Natural gas isn't great, but it beats the heck out of burning coal. Do we prefer that instead?
And that's without getting into the root cause of all our problems, which us that there are too many humans and we're destroying this planet. And nobody wants to address that.
>I mean, let's say people in the future have rights
bold assumption
Blowing up a pipeline would be completely counter-productive, no matter how radical someone's views are.
What do they think is going to happen after they blow up a pipeline? The oil / gas company is going to cease all operations and shutter its business?
Of course it won't. They'll just move the oil and gas by more wasteful, more carbon-intensive trains until the pipeline is fixed. Good work, Extinction Rebellion. 
Its like the drugs trade. You stop production, not by thinking you can stop supply by burning poppy fields and blowing up pipelines but by the limiting demand for the product. That's where the focus needs to be.
It's true. The desire for retribution is very powerful.
I hate using the term dog whistling as it has been very watered down but effectively yes
No climate activist with half a brain would consider actually blowing up a pipeline. I'm fairly certain Suzuki was not speaking literally and my reply was facetious; "blown up tubes" is a metaphor for what is being dubbed "eco terrorism." Look into the book How to Blow Up a Pipeline by Andreas Malm and exercise that tiny bit of critical thinking you speak of.

Canada Goose does have good performance in extreme coldness. Check out Yellowknife and streets are filled with those
Fuck Canada Goose. Overpriced crap.
Yeah, we really want to trust the Xi government.

In case of paywall:
>In an earnings call this month, executives at Canada Goose said they were expecting a strong holiday season, in spite of the coronavirus pandemic and global supply chain issues, driven in large part by demand for the brand’s luxury parkas in China.
>They may have been excited, therefore, to see that on Friday, Canada Goose was the number one topic on social media platform Weibo, with more than 240 million views on posts about the brand.
>Just why Canada Goose was trending, however, will have significantly dampened executives’ spirits, and perhaps their hopes for a China-led surge in purchasing this winter.
>Earlier this year, regulators in Shanghai accused Canada Goose of “misleading” advertising, and fined the company’s Chinese affiliate, Xiji Trading Co., 450,000 yuan ($90,000). The regulator cited ads that state all of the down blends in Canada Goose jackets “contain Hutterite down, the best and warmest Canadian down.” China’s advertising law prohibits terms such as “the highest level” or “the best.” The decision also found the claims were misleading, in part because the warmth of down is not directly tied to its origins.
>In September, the state-run Economic Daily published a commentary titled “Catching the lying Canada Goose,” which accused the company of failing to understand the country’s advertising laws. The paper said Canada Goose had also “overlooked the changes in the Chinese market” and failed to realize consumers no longer have “blind faith in foreign brands.”
>“The moon isn’t rounder in foreign countries, and foreign down jackets aren’t warmer,” the paper said, urging Chinese companies to use the scandal as an opportunity to increase market share.
>In a statement, Canada Goose blamed a text error “found on our partner site TMall. As soon as we were made aware it was updated.”
>When the scandal broke, some in Canada linked it to ongoing tensions between Ottawa and Beijing over the detention of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou and Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. Other brands have faced boycotts and official censure during periods of geopolitical strife with Beijing.
>With Ms. Meng and the Michaels released just weeks after Shanghai regulators fined Xiji Trading, Canada Goose could have been forgiven for thinking the brand might regain its position as top choice for conspicuous Chinese consumption come winter.
>Despite selling for upwards of 10,000 yuan ($2,000), Canada Goose jackets are hugely popular in China. The Toronto-based brand operates 14 stores across the Chinese mainland, with three more in Hong Kong and Macao. Its store on TMall, the Alibaba-owned e-commerce platform, recorded sales of 167 million yuan ($33.2 million) in 2020, according to Chinese state media. In a recent statement, Canada Goose said its wider Asia-Pacific business was worth around a quarter of a billion dollars.
>With temperatures dropping below freezing across much of northern China, this is prime parka season. This could be why on Friday, the decision by Shanghai regulators against Xiji Trading was recirculating on Weibo, quickly going viral as users noticed “the Canada Goose penalty decision is really a guide to purchasing down jackets.”
>In the decision, regulators explain what makes a quality down jacket, from the type of feathers used to stuff the coat, to their “fill power” and “loft,” industry terms that refer to how the down traps air and insulates the wearer. As posts about Canada Goose attracted millions of views, many popular commentators and state-media accounts jumped on the trend, publishing infographics and guides on how to shop for down jackets, many of which are critical of the quality of the Canadian parkas.
>“In general, domestic clothing and sports brands, especially some of the smaller brands, have the highest cost performance and are worth buying,” wrote finance blogger He Xi in a widely-shared post. “These brands use the same fabric as international high-end products, and achieve the same warmth retention or heat dissipation rate as international high-end products … but are a lot cheaper.”
>Mr. He compared such brands to Huawei, Xiaomi and other Chinese tech companies whose high quality, cut price handsets helped break the dominance of foreign brands like Apple over China’s smartphone market in the 2010s.
>“Canada Goose’s cost performance is the lowest among all brands,” he added. “It’s not too much to say that the price of its clothes is just an IQ tax.”
>Other commenters noted that in the past Chinese people had placed high value on foreign brands, but this was changing due to scandals like that involving Canada Goose, as well as improvements in the quality of domestic Chinese brands.
>The Canada Goose statement said the company was “grateful that customers in China and around the world trust us as an authentic brand, and we have seen that reflected in the continued growth of our business.”
>The statement added that growth had been “particularly strong in mainland China,” with more than 85 per cent growth in direct-to-consumer sales in the last quarter.
The Chinese government can and has forced domestic purchasing of items. Since it could be unpopular they run propaganda campaigns to convince the people they shouldn’t want the foreign items.
China's economic development has the advantage of looking to the west for what works and what doesn't.  The buy American attitude in the USA is definitely something China will want to replicate.   China understands how to make thing across the quality spectrum, with the incentives the media has to promote pro china, if they move to a Buy Chinese attitude their will be a huge shift in global brands.
Seems like all the right reasons to me. Canada goose is a horrendous company using horrendous anomaly cruelty practices. Fuck them.
"Poorly Made in China" by Paul Midler - great book, all one needs to know about production practices there
So you *do* understand the appeal of CG.
Growing up in the north, I can't say I've never given half a damn about the brand of my, or anyone else's, parka, and the notion that someone would is utterly baffling to me.
> it's as a status symbol.
Yes.
And for more useless status symbol shit people waste their money on simply for bragging rights, [here's](https://www.holtrenfrew.com/en/Products/Mens/Mens-Clothing/Shorts/BALENCIAGA-Political-Campaign-Sweat-Shorts/p/20200755002) some $750 cotton shorts.
It’s a bit like the Rolex of jackets. It relies on a reputation of quality to bolster its use as a status symbol - so if you question its quality you are also undermining its appropriateness as a signifier of status. To a degree. Many customers won’t care because ultimatly quality isn’t the driving factor in demand - both Rolex and Canada Goose have cheaper alternatives that are at least as effective/quality. At some point, the high cost itself is what makes it a wealth signfier regardless of its objective quality. That’s the reason why the Chinese love CG by the way - because it is hard to acquire. Chinese bloggers pointing out cheaper alternatives make a good point but also miss the main point.
I can understand why people going unto extreme cold buy them.
Hey, if the Chinese want to buy some overpriced Canadian crap, I say turnabout is fair play.

So you are thinking that the Chinese domestic down being promoted by the state is produced more humanely?

> But his application for a $450,000 grant this month from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) was turned down because, the council said, “the Equity, Diversity and Inclusion considerations in the application were deemed insufficient.”

> Around the same time that Kambhampati’s latest application was turned down, another arm of the government, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, gave Dr. Lana Ray, a professor at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay, Ont., a $1.2-million grant to study cancer prevention using traditional Indigenous healing practices. When the award was announced, Ray said “We need to stop framing prevalent risk factors of cancer as such and start thinking about them as symptoms of colonialism.”
Where are you "trust the science" people now?  Is this the "evidence based policy" that Trudeau promised us when he was first elected?  
These are federal research grants and we are effectively granting them for vanity projects that contribute nothing to society and actively denying them to real scientists.
I'm a recruiter working for a major global staffing firm. I'm of Indian descent and have no angle here. The company has a policy where we are not allowed to engage clients that ask for candidates of a specific gender or race. The past few years though, many of our clients, including a big 5 bank, have asked for 'diverse' candidates only for many tech roles. What's more surprising is the firm I work for is turning a blind eye to this and going along with the candidate searches. This is actual system racism being allowed. Also many of the recruiters I work with now assume when they see a 'diverse' candidate in a top position that they must have been a diversity hire.
I'm the stereotypical white male working for a big company in IT. Like many others, our company has jumped on the big diversity game. I'm all for being inclusive, so it only seemed like a good thing to me. I've however been aware of a few times one of our (female) executives who is heavily involved in all the diversity stuff has said very disparaging things about "white men" and more in general men. I've got pretty thick skin and can take a joke, so I never even bat an eye and assumed it was kind of tounge-in-cheek. Recently a coworker compiled a list of all the "jokes" he could source from and the list was over 30 instances, some of them pretty cringey involving killing men, etc. It made it kind of clear it wasn't a joke in bad taste, but a reoccurring pattern
Last week my coworker who compiled that list was let go for apparently unrelated reasons. I'm not really involved in the whole diversity and social justice work, but holy shit this doesn't sit well with me and makes me bitter about the whole diversity movement. If I made jokes about killing woman, I am reasonably sure I'd be escorted out the door the same day and probably a police report filed.
This was, apparently, his equity, diversity, and inclusion statement which the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada deemed insufficient:
>The academic team consists of the PK group. Our group is highly diverse, being populated by men and women from many countries and religions and cultures. Our group is also highly diverse in terms of intellectual background and research areas of expertise. Our group has a long history of inclusion of women into ultrafast laser science, which has some of the lowest populations of women in STEM. The corporate partners are also highly diverse, spanning several countries of origin with a number of women in STEM in key roles for Photon Etc and few-cycle. We will recruit a diverse array of students and HQP during the course of this project. We will hire the most qualified people based upon their skills and mutual interests, with outreach activities to help. We will advertise in Women in STEM organizations. We will recruit via word of mouth, noting my recent female PhD is now on a tenure track position in Physics in Germany. She is now one of the leading young women in physics in the globe, who was trained and mentored in my system.

This is outrageous. Also saw this that made the news relating to education in Ontario today; https://windsorstar.com/news/canada/ontario-teachers-union-implements-controversial-weighted-voting-system-to-increase-minority-representation/wcm/956e54a4-a99b-40c2-a3ba-e0c9a3c4f455/amp/
Are we living in an alternate reality? This strikes me… racist?
As a visible minority and immigrant, I'm not sure what's worse: being discriminated against, or the white people who think it's their job to solve my problems. Both stink of racism. Yes, there has been prejudice. No, I don't want you save me from it. Just let me compete with everyone else based on what I can offer, not on what I look like.
>I don't care about the colour of your skin. I'm interested in hiring someone who wants to work on the project and is good at it,' Prof. Patanjali Kambhampati says
We had a lovely, incredibly personable and obviously bright woman (she/her) come and talk to our partner group about diversity in the workplace and systemic racism a couple months ago.
After got done politely calling us all racists, she argued that she too, as a black woman, was guilty of perpetuating white supremacy because earlier in her career she held exactly the same beliefs - people should be hired on merit and the best person for the job, regardless of skin color or gender, should be selected.
It was kind of shocking to me to hear a black woman essentially try and shoulder the blame for centuries of racism directed at her people, but that is apparently where the thinking is in the modern progressive movement - POCs are white supremacists if they believe, as this professor does, that stupid stuff like skills and experience matter.
What is truly important is what demographic boxes a person checks. To disagree is akin to bigotry.
Several members of our partner groups are from minority backgrounds (some indo-Canadians, Japanese-Canadians etc.) They openly disagreed with this during the talk and their opinions were dismissed out-of-hand.

Ladies and gentlemen, your tax dollars hard at work
Wait til people find out it's not just universities...
This is getting to be quite an issue. Better funding and "un-muzzling" of scientists was a big part of the Liberal agenda as they took power in 2015. Indeed, funding has increased.... but with many many strings attached and the new issues are almost more insidious.
If you don't know, Tri-Council is our federal funding agency for all academic fields - it includes NSERC (sciences), SSHRC (social sciences) and CIHR (medical/health). The Liberals increased funding, but it all went into these special programs where they control the agenda including adjudication. We're talking about 100s millions of dollars here over successive budgets. The NFRF grant, or "New Frontiers" which this article is about is the prime example - it is a new grant. The application, where you outline the substance of your project (here to get 450,000k) consists of 5 pages. 2/3rds of that 5 pages requested for NFRF is basically about discussing equity, diversity and inclusion within the research and project. You get about 1.5 pages to talk about actual science. More concerning is the process of how these are evaluated at the Tri Council level and it has become highly politicized to the point that there is very little or consideration of actual scientific substance, and it is being evaluated by people who are wholly unqualified. Other hijacked programs are the Canada Research Chairs, the graduate funding programs (Vanier) which have basically become a pageant of insisting you are repressed and therefore should be the top of the field.
I got interested in this after trying to learn more about the **Prof Bourassa** case at UofS and how it came to be that someone with a general PhD in Social Sciences was "Scientific Director" of CIHRs institute for Indigenous Health. The link between that story and this one should be clear by this point: [https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/federal-health-research-funding-body-cuts-ties-carrie-bourassa-1.6252691](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/federal-health-research-funding-body-cuts-ties-carrie-bourassa-1.6252691). Her "fake Indigenous identity" is only the tip of that story. But you need only look through the job postings for recent academic positions in Canada to see how this comes to be: [https://www.universityaffairs.ca/search-job/](https://www.universityaffairs.ca/search-job/). MANY of the new positions literally say what ethnicity or non-binary gender you should be in order to apply. These are for publicly funded institutes - i.e. YOU pay for them. In many cases, they are handing massive grants to completely incompetent people as a result... based solely on their "self-identity".
Canadian voters are generally "pro-science" but but expect positive outcomes of the money spent. That's not what we are getting for the enormous tax dollars put into this. What you can do to save Canadian research is write to your MP and demand better accountability for how research money is spent, that prioritizes both academic substance and merit. EDI in the academic community is a valid issue, but what you can do to help is impress on your MP that you want to see action at the level of childhood education that makes pathways for underrepresented groups to succeed in research careers. Trying to engineer this from the top so that it "looks equal" is a surface treatment that undermines the commitment to scientific integrity, innovation and creativity that makes Universities and research institutes worth funding.
And if you're a journalist reading this comment.... I'd encourage you to do some reporting, reach out to Canada's to scientists and ask what is going on. They will walk you through the utter absurdity of the situation and show you differences between rejected and accepted grants. It's totally nuts.
Nothing like a debate about race to distract people from economic inequality.
I've seen many businesses, mostly large ones either factory or similar that have been hiring many indigenous, middle eastern, disabled, gender xyz, etc. Actual quotas or similar especially if they're angling for certain funding or approvals from those groups.
Whatever happened to as he says hiring on merit. Your credentials, your score on tests, job experience, people skills, and ability to speak English well (regardless of accent or no).
We've gone so far that we're seeing companies where they could be seen as anti white which is also racist but apparently ok as long as they can fill all the other buckets to claim as diverse as possible.
Don't forget temp foreign workers or workers that are over qualified and will work for almost anything and exploiting them.
This is getting stupid.
Serious question: what can be done to turn the tide? A culture of silence has overtaken this country.
Hiring on race is racist in contrast to what woke liberals want you to believe.
If you pull up her research, it states more fully that it wants to “*identify common risk factors* for cancer as directly related to the impact of colonialism” and “examine traditional healing methods”.
Here’s some things I could think of off the top of my head, coming from the area:
Are there any traditional medications people are using. Are they at all helpful, or would rolling them into western cancer treatment schemes help make people more comfortable when they attend.
Are colonial impacts on diet, lifestyle etc impacting cancer rates artificially- ie: are indigenous dismissing changeable factors because they have been told their genetically more prone to certain illnesses when in fact other factors are at play.
Are higher cancer rates a result of post-colonial mistrust of western medicine, and can we work on solutions to increase willingness to access care.
Are western doctors dismissing symptoms in indigenous patients out of concious or unconscious bias, leading to later diagnosis and worse outcomes. 
Is things like distance to access care impacting early diagnosis - again- you can call this a post-colonial effect as many reserves were moved deliberately to more remote areas.
Are reserves on contaminated land- areas used for industrial waste dumping, for instance. This has been seen in the US as well- anyone who’s seen Erin Brokovich would be familiar with this. 
We lost a half dozen of my in-laws female family members back to back within a couple years of each other- all from the same generation and reserve- all from multi-systemic cancers. The reserve had flooded badly several years in a row  back in the 60s, and we still question if contamination from the nearby mill caused this. 
The research grant goes on to say that treatments need to go hand in hand with screening and with deeper investigations into the causes of cancer in indigenous populations - and that drawing upon traditional frameworks would help integrate both systems into a holistic patient care model.
I mean, we have priests in hospitals for the comfort of Catholic patients- we have naturopathic “doctors” clinics”- is this much different ?
I’m suspicious that this professor used a Native research study as an example exactly because he knew it would produce this effect- and that he cherry picked one line out of a larger grant proposal in order to maximize outrage. It’s a bit underhanded.
I found the perfect technician to hire that would add greatly to my business. Alas, he was white. H.R. would have none of it.
Where does this end? Really disturbing.
Some people call Conservatism a disease but it's shit like this that also makes liberalism a disease. At heart I'm a liberal but when I see stories like this it makes me lean right because of how absolutely asinine these kinds of policies are.
The way I look at it, everyone should be equal, EVERYONE. If I'm hiring for a position that requires specific experience and skills and I have two candidates, one of which has what I'm looking for and the other doesn't, skin color or ethnicity should not play any role in that decision. 
Those who believe otherwise are racists too but they don't see it that way.
This is literal systemic racial discrimination.
As flawed as our application of it is, strong meritocratic principles are one of the pillars of Liberalism and one of the greatest innovations western civilization has ever adopted.
We are heading down a very dark path.
Thereby further continiuing their path to meaninglessness.
Smart person. Cool. Not sure black hole expertise is really relevant to the Canadian experience.
Trans. Cool symbolism. Not sure that gets a whack load of people rushing into the tent.
As unidealistic as this sounds, they need to find a seasoned politician who shares their ideals and get them installed as the leader.
Until they are willing to admit that they are a political party first and work on developing party strength in the political world, their admirable goals will never entice enough Canadians to them.
I'm sure most Canadians don't want to kill the environment and therefore their municipality, province, country or planet. But unless the Greens can explain how they are going to do that  AND keep Canadians employed, keep the health care systems working for them, keep them safe from the bad people in the world, etc. etc. they are doomed to obscurity.
Please - will someone make them stop?
Well, another leader that ticks off the necessary boxes.
We will see how long this one lasts.
The green party sounds really out of touch with working and middle class Canadians.  What votes do they expect to bring in?
Why wouldn’t they appoint one of their actual MP’s.  This is silly.
The Rational View had an interesting discussion with Amita: https://therationalview.podbean.com/e/a-rational-shade-of-green-with-dr-amita-kuttner/
Well they are an astrophysicist that is an expert in black holes which is what the green party has become. So couldn’t ask for better credentials
Cool, so when does the interim champ fight Elizabeth May for the unified title?
green party is a joke they just play identity politics
Interesting that Kuttner went to boarding school in california and then university to earn a PhD in california. And cofounded a US political action group to elect women scientists....
She’s like even more American than Elizabeth May. She must not be a US citizen though or she would have stayed in California.
I got a 404 error when I tried to load the page.
Pretty much sums up the Greens. hahaha
I'd be curious if they at least offered it to the runner-up of the leadership contest first. Second place should have had right of first refusal IMO.
The party needs a complete revival.
I threw my hat in to help in my riding this past election since I was let down by the other parties, and felt as though the Greens could spark some sort of revolution.
The candidate had zero interest in running, wasn't able to get the 150 signatures needed to be on the ballot, and printed out a bunch of flyers beforehand, not seeing the irony of producing hundreds of single use printed cardstock.
I was messaging the members of the party trying my best to help and was ghosted after the work they needed was complete, never implemented.
We got an email chastising us for not getting the candidate who had zero personality, vision, or idea of what's happening on the ballot. I'm still subscribed to their newsletters and they've completely given up. They're holding a zoom session on anti-islamophobia and... That's it...  Important subject, but the party is scattershot on what's actually going on.
This past election was proof that nobody cares about the issues anymore, only voting for  'red, blue, orange, or racist'. I've given up on Canadian politicians as a whole, and I don't see that sentiment changing anytime soon.
The Green Party chooses leaders the same way [Vice comes up with article ideas.](https://youtu.be/Ia7fUQXskvA)

Isn't Erin O'Toole the first Trans leader of a political party in Canada?
> I'm sure most Canadians don't want to kill the environment and therefore their municipality, province, country or planet.

They had a fair extensive array of non-environmental pledges... but of course little/no details on how it would be accomplished.
Their 2021 platform included:
* a doubling of funding to municipalities
* national rent controls
* all housing policies aimed at low-income/affordable housing exclusively, rather than addressing the supply/demand issue that affects everyone
* a guaranteed livable income
* eliminate tuition
* eliminate federal student loan debt
* universal pharmacare
* universal dental care
* universal child care
* increasing CPP payouts while at the same time telling the CPP investment board what it can and can't invest in
* financial transactions tax
* increasing the capital gains inclusion rate to 100%
They make the NDP look like fiscally-conservative centrists.  They clearly have zero concept of a budget.  How can the above be taken seriously?
Also, not fiscal issues, but so insane (combined) that I had to highlight:
* lowering voting age to 16
* mandatory voting
* online voting
The problem isn't that they give no attention to other issues... the problem is that they propose policy like a 6th grader, with no regard for the money needed.
New motto: "We were slightly irrelevant before but we're not quitters - we're going for the wholly irrelevant now"
Who would you have preferred to lead the party? 
Also they are interim leader, they are literally a place holder whose job isn't to rebuild the party.
Deteriorating standard of living will lead to increase in crime rate, unfortunately.
I guess that's what happens when you target the wrong people, and then when you catch the people you, well we let them out early, "the system failed them" maybe so, but it has failed so many people but they're not out murdering people.
The massacre in Nova Scotia certainly contributed
Let's make our sentences even lighter.
"Banning more firearms not associated with any of this will surely fix it and make people happy!"
- LPC Staffers
Not hard to see where and how StatsCan politicizes these statistics. Remember when StatsCan was supposed to be politically neutral? Pepperidge Farm remembers.
A global pandemic forcing everyone inside does a lot to expose issues people wanted to ignore.
The mental health issues at the heart of this problem aren't new, they're just being exposed by hard times. Remember that when things go back to "normal".
Convenient that the studies match the narrative as Justin is trying to outlaw handguns. Almost as if there has been collusion for the last couple of years. If true, why are we trusting this narcissist to fix things as things have gotten worst under his watch?
But all the scary guns are banned, however could this have happened?!
[deleted]
7%.  So next year it may be down 7%.
Will that then mean deteriorating standard of living leads to decrease in crime rate?
Murder rates are much more likely impacted by gang violence in urban centres. A vibrant city like Chicago has higher murder rates than a stagnant city like Buffalo. In Canada rates are highest in Alberta with the higest percent of males  under 35…the main perpetrators and victims of murder.
That may explain why the crime rate has small ups and downside, but is generally decreasing, sure.
I don’t think murder rates have anything to do with that.
Yeah, by themselves they account for half of the YoY increase.
Yeah, thats probably close to an average years total in NS.
Sentences are just a small part of the equation. The US has much harsher sentences than us and still is at 3x our homicide rate. Meanwhile, Norway has much lighter sentences and we have a homicide rate that is 4x higher.
No one committing crimes does a risk analysis of the punishment if they get caught.
And ban more guns from legal owners while you’re at it.
Look, I'm not exactly a fan of Trudeau.
But why are you calling him Justine? Is it somehow a putdown to give him a woman's version of his name? If this is the level of discourse people feel like participating in it's no wonder the LPC won the election again.

We should be trying to protect global democracy now. He's not the threat.  The globalist elite are. Build back better...
So interfere with US politics?
If the Democrats run Grandpa Joe in 2024, Trump has a serious chance of winning.
Diversify, Diversify, Diversify. That should be the rule for any future foreign policy, economic policy, and national security policy regardless of who wins in 2024 or beyond. Steadily decoupling from the US is never a bad idea and gives Canada more options.
Jesus Christ , Canada should fix its own god damn problems before anything elsec
While Trump is an arrogant asshole, he's no superman. There's no need to panic over the possibility that he might run again.
At this point while I dislike trump and his policies, it feels so shoved down my throat how to feel about him that it makes me question my opinions on him - even if I thought he was an idiot from the start.
Ha! The media will love it if Trump wins! It guarantees another few years of Trump bashing and orange man bad articles which people love to outrage on.
Many opinion writers disguised as news reporters found jobs while he was in office and lost jobs when he left.
I doubt he will, much can change in three years and him getting older with more viable candidates on the horizon won’t help his cause. 
Some polling suggests Trump would currently beat Biden, I think he would too, but what happened on January 6th is a major turnoff. With Biden out of the scenario (he won’t be running again) I just don’t see Trump beating whoever that Dem candidate willl be. 
I firmly believe the media will also say the same thing about whoever the Republican candidate is going to be. 
This article is paywalled but I’m going to guess it’s aimed at Trumps protectionism.
The Democrats down there should keep fortifying their elections and they won’t have to worry about having President with the gall to pull out of the WHO, Paris agreement or whatever global policy there is then.
My wife will be happy, she never missed a show.
Hmmmmmmm I think global corporate greed buying our media outlets and controlling information are more of a threat than Donald Trump. Also, if he is able to win somehow after losing and that shit show of a campaign I think that is a sign that their democracy is functional? Just because either side doesn't like a result doesn't mean democracy isn't working.

“As before, he would imperil world peace, give cover to authoritarians everywhere …” Im failing to see how he gave cover to authoritarians?
Our own government is trying to censor the internet and brags about upping the immigration rate to suppress wages. I’m not worried about trump I’m worried about Trudeau as should most Canadians. Also maybe the left should take a look in the mirror and consider why this buffoon has so much traction.
The media’s boogeyman
How could trump win? Biden is doing such a great job.
>"First, we must buttress our trade access to the United States. That means strengthening our relationships with governors, senators and mayors in states with substantial trade relations with Canada, making the case that any future restrictions will not only harm us but their own people and products. Canada successfully deployed this strategy with the Trump administration when the president put NAFTA in his crosshairs."
Weak sauce.  NAFTA Is dead and they already pushed us with the USMCA. If you want to put the fear of God into Trump (or the rest) dangle the One Belt One Road.  Trump will do what he wants and some senator won't sway him.  This is a recipe for subservience.
>"Second, we must prioritize diplomacy with key allies to develop a co-ordinated and mutually reinforcing strategy to defend our multilateral commitments to environmental protection and sustainability, disarmament and non-proliferation and the integrity of international financial institutions. Canada should dispatch senior ministers to Europe and across Africa, Asia and the Americas to speak discreetly but bluntly with allies and create a united front when our shared commitments come under threat. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should make the same case to his counterparts at global summits around the world, including meetings of the Group of Seven, the Group of 20, the Commonwealth, La Francophonie and APEC."
Talking with your friends again I see.  Comforting isn't it?  And how pointless. They can sing kumbiya if they wish. What would this accomplish, besides make Trump think "conspiracy!"
>"Third, Canada can advance both our own interests and the world’s by fashioning a collective response to the coming attack on democracy. This could take many forms, but perhaps the easiest way forward is to capitalize on the upcoming Summit of Democracies, recently announced by Mr. Biden. The President plans to convene the summit in December, then hold a second, more elaborate meeting in 2022. Canada could propose to create a new, innovative, flexible and permanent coalition of democracies that would go beyond occasional meetings."
What a crock.  The coming attack!  No, what attacks democracies is money, oligarchy, corruption.  Democracy die from the inside. Incidentally, that is why Trump will win, IMHO: the US has been corrupt for so long it has forgotten everyone without a six figure pay packet.  Drive around any major city here and look at the tent subdivisions. It is shameful for a country so wealthy to care so little about her own citizens.  The endless wars supposedly promoting democracy have bankrupted the nation and a lot of those vets are now living on the street.  
God help us all when these clowns convince us to bomb yet more countries into "democracy".  They have not succeeded anywhere and have no prospects for a future sucess either.  
Trump is not the solution and he's just riding the wave of discontent (and underwhelming in every other way for that matter) but the Dems should just stop the white man's burden business.  Most people in the world have no wish to mimic our political system--they have their own traditions, history, beliefs and they should be allowed as a people to choose their own political system.
Canada isn't doing shit and has zero respect on the global stage. Thanks Trudeau.
Not that I want it to happen, but I think trump would beat Biden next to around. God help us all

I’m worried that the penalties and fines for animal cruelty convictions will continue to be a joke despite the new task force. The animal welfare law in Canada is barley changed since it’s creation over 200 years ago and it shows. Even some of the worst animal cruelty cases in Canadian history basically got off with community service or a small  fine because the wording is so unclear or lacking any teeth. Animal cruelty laws need a major overhaul for task forces to be effective. As it stands our pitiful laws are all bark and no bite.
I could never do this job. I would go full-on vigilante.
My deepest respect for those who do this for a living and manage to hold it together.
Does this include farm animals?
About fucking time, maybe now we can get a few more of these units to in the lower mainland
Reminds me of that dog fighting issue that was a thing briefly 20 years ago
I didn't know they formed a unit just for Kenney. Impressive.
So animals will have dedicated unit investigating cruelty?  Very good, now if only the Crown would prosecute obvious assaults by EPS, people might have some protections from the police.
Animal cruelty sentences in Alberta already frequently include jail and extremely high fines.
Most animal cruelty legislation includes something like "This law does not apply to animals traditionally used in agriculture..." Farmed animals are pretty much on their own.
On the progressive side though, the SPCA in BC have just begun doing some unannounced inspections of farms. After quite a few horrible farmed animal abuse cases in the last few years in BC were brought to light. The BC SPCA's example should be copied everywhere else in the country.
I doubt the maximum is often sought. A woman in 2018 starved two horses and was found not guilty;
[https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/woman-found-not-guilty-in-evansburg-animal-cruelty-case-1.5174972](https://edmonton.ctvnews.ca/woman-found-not-guilty-in-evansburg-animal-cruelty-case-1.5174972)
This list of crimes in the link below doesn't describe any penalties or punishments other than fines of a few thousand dollars, not buying an animal for a certain length of time, or owning a certain number of animals despite starvation, cruelty, neglect, or leaving animals in distress. 
[https://www.albertaspca.org/animal-protection/recent-convictions/](https://www.albertaspca.org/animal-protection/recent-convictions/)
I would argue that jail time or extremely high fines are very rare or difficult to apply when the wording for the animal cruelty/welfare law is garbage.
Definitely not complaining at the improvement, but even unannounced inspections seem like they may not prevent a lot of the issues that have happened. Even with a surprise visit, once they're on site, people could stop beating the animals, for example. But they may create a false reassurance that the abuse isn't happening.

$15,000 fine 
All of these occurred over a 3 year period.
Not every case rises to the level where sentences like these are justified, but you don't tend to see them imposed nearly as often anywhere else as you do in Alberta.
Good points. 
The answer is government funded animal cruelty investigative organizations. ie mix the BC SPCA with the new Ontario PAWS which replaced the old Ontario SPCA. Have a government funded organization that has the ambition of the BC SPCA - and the resources and accountability that a government funded organization has.
Why in the actual fudge are there donor-funded charities enforcing animal cruelty legislation anywhere ? It makes no sense.

Interesting take, though the article goes back and forth calling it a court and tribunal. Those aren’t the same thing.
Predetermined victim-abuser decisions though, which is just going to go bad. 
So the ‘good’ parts of it are: 
- cutting it into a new court to show that Quebec has a serious domestic/sexual abuse problem
- providing services to help people through the court system, and training staff to do that well. 
The bad: 
- Another report compiled in August by a working group made up of experts from several provincial ministries, as well as the Court of Quebec and the Crown prosecutor's office, said the tribunal should have an approach * "centred on the victim."*
If the court/tribunal is only helping the ‘victim’, the accused is predetermined to be the offender.  But we won’t talk about wrongful accusations here, because it’s sufficient to suggest that a predetermined “who is the victim” mentality will lead to problems.
As long as this isn't unbalancing the scales of justice  in any way, I don't see anything wrong with the supports it would seem this will provide.
The current courts should handle all this stuff. Why more bureaucracy?
Because it looks bad on those who vote 'no', I guess.
If creating a separate parallel system helps expedite these cases I'm all for it.
Current legal wait times are ridiculous
They made the decision to submit an offer for way more than the house is worth without conditions. They're SOL. And it serves them right.
Honestly, buying without a home inspection shouldn't even be allowed, but it's become normalized. These days if you offer "pending inspection", your offer is the first one tossed. Desperation and greed did this.
Just sell it to the next guy for 200k more and accept  no conditions.
And the next guy can do the same. These things are  not meant to live in, its a stock you get rid of.
You bought a house without conditions. You made your bed, now lay in it.
Here's an idea to cool the housing market;
1)  start govt regulated House Inspection industry 
2)  homes CANNOT be sold without an inspection first (at the sellers expense)
3)  Inspection report must be included and disclosed with the rest of the house's info (price, sq ft, bedrooms etc) 
4)  make real estate licensing a 4 year degree (with a whole year spent of ETHICS)
EDIT: 
5) Ban foreign and corporate ownership of housing (aside from charities & non profit housing corps), tax 2nd homes in ALL metropolitan areas, Wealth Tax, Capital Gains Tax, & Personal Wealth Cap set at $500 million.
I'm seeing a lot of tone-deaf comments here saying "well that's why you don't buy without conditions" and "they deserved it"
In the current crazy housing market you are left very little choice. I bought earlier this year after ~2 years of searching and many times I bid far over asking as required, was asked by the seller to consider removing conditions, and then the house went to someone else who offered $5,000-$20,000 less with no conditions. 
And house prices as we all know aren't slowing down. People looking to buy are stuck between a rock and a hard place to compete for ever-increasing house prices, offering far over asking prices in blind bidding processes, and being pressured to have no conditions. I felt the increase in price between when I started and finally bought. It's not just an easy ask to tell people they should only buy with conditions.
If I was running for office in Ontario, I'd put making inspections mandatory in my platform.
Why would someone make one of the single largest purchases of their life without getting some kind of inspection?
Frankly, inspections should be required and not optional as a condition of sale. Saves everyone (including the seller) so much grief.
Interesting. Lawsuits against individual agents require legal rep and would eat up a lot of those FOMO gains. Lawyers are needed but not salespeople.
Yeap i have a client who boight but found mould and poor plumbing.. cracks in walls and foundation.. 
Didnt get a inspection so he is out of luck
So this no conditions no home inspections is tricky. Yes the buyers are sol, to a degree. But the very fact that one pretty much needs to have no conditions and no home inspection in order to actually buy is a sign of a sick, sick market (as in ill, not as in awesome). Real estate lawyers have been sounding the alarm about sales like this in Vancouver for almost 2 decades now.
As a nation, we need to do something about the out of control housing markets across the country.
If you buy a house without inspecting it. You get no sympathy from me.
These ppl made there bed now shut up and sleep in it
I don't really get how realtors are allowed to sell garbage with no repusrcusions. Like what do they even do for there thousands in commission these days? What are sales job comes with absolutely 0 liability risks?
It really shouldn’t be on the buyer. Instead make an independent inspection a requirement to be listed as a seller. Cut the realtor fees back by $500-$1000. 
When I sold my last house I listed all the stuff that needed fixing. When an offer came in they had no room to negotiate the price down further. “You knew the hot water tank needs replacing in 3 years when you made your initial offer.”  
We plan to list our current house in April/May and will be getting an inspection done. I hope to remedy anything that comes up. We will provide copies to any buyers. This way it speeds up the closing process rather than me waiting on them to schedule an inspection. I gain the benefit of leaving the house open to offers and not tied up.
> litigation after buying *without* consent
Burn and learn, life is short and lessons an be harsh.
If you buy a house with no conditions, you deserve all the angst and ruin you have coming.
Haha...enjoy your repairs and spending big bucks!!
Hahahahahahaaaa!!! 
FOMO crowd=lemmings or buffalo running off cliff.
Haha, eat shit, speculators.
Housing only goes up - so does the stupid people buying over inflated homes without conditions.
It would sure help with eliminating the “cash” economy and the related tax evasion.
C.D. Howe Institute just concluded that Canada should have banks. A *digital* asset measured 1 for 1 in Canadian dollars that can be exchanged for a real asset is literally just your bank balance.
China’s digital yuan is a game changer. Would be interesting to see Canada follow suit with a CBDC.
Yes, we need more digital currencies. How about we adopt one. There are plenty to chose from, XRP. ETHER, etc.
Careful what controls you ask to be implemented. Cash is popular for many, many reasons beside underground economical reasons. I, for one don't want to deal with a government being able to lock me out completely from currency for whatever reason.
Crypto is a pyramid scheme, sounds like it's right up this government's ally.
How else is the government supposed to track and tax every single penny that gets passed around
Yeah, no thanks.
CBDC’s are very different from other cryptocurrencies. A CBDC is backed by a central reserve just like fiat currencies. The only difference is they are issued in a digital form.
But then the feds wouldn't be able to artificially create more of it
society is pyramid scheme.
Not really. 
XRP is capped at 100 billion, and there can be no more than that ever issued.
Ether is not capped, but it contains deflationary measures, including the proposal to impose a hard cap on it.

I love how they have franchised.

His fate like many Canadian jihadists have been sealed.

I'm really happy for him.

Does anyone believes the liberals actually want to do anything but talk about come election time? They belong to the oil industry just as much as the cons do.
I tend to judge politicians by what they do, not by what they say. Based on that, Prime Minister Trudeau and the Liberals have convinced me they're not really interested in doing anymore about the environment or climate heating beyond what is necessary to be able to say they're doing *something* during election campaigns.
That’s just the nature of things.
Imagine Maxine Bernier (who I’ll also refer to as an activist, not a politician) said we could blow up vaccine production facilities, and then apologized and blamed it on *vaccine mandate frustrations*. Would an apology be good enough? Or would something more serious be needed? 
Think about how you would react to that before looking at this and saying “good, let’s move on”.
He's absolute hypocritical trash.... do as I say,  not as I do
Not good enough.  Charge him with "uttering" under the Criminal Code.
Right, it took way too long. He should have apologized right after it came out of his mouth. This guy is a nut and needs to retire.
He waited way too long to apologize.
Anyway hope the Green Party dies.
He needs to be charged to set an example.  Sabotage of a pipeline would be disastrous for our country.  It could severely hurt our economy and people that rely on the products that pipelines transport.
He should prove his apologies are sincere by building a pipeline.... and not blowing it up later
Navigator insists Suzuki is very sorry.
Never apologize for saying something you truly believe.
We understand David. You got caught up in the moment.
90% sure this is people gaslighting everyone else to illustrate how stupid the concept of dogwhistling is.
ha, what a nothingburger of a story for people who want to be pissed at someone
Conservatives can stop clutching their pearls now
Dog whistling accusations are only allowed to go one way, though.
Pipelines and vaccine production facilities are different things, though. One has good impacts and one has bad impacts. I'm not agreeing with what Suzuki said, but this kind of false equivalence does not shed much light.
Fuck it. Just let it go. David Suzuki just wants everyone to think he is still relevant.
I watched about three seconds of a CBC report about the new Green Party interim leader. They lead with her being "non-binary" and secondly that she's an astrophysicist. Why is someones sexual identity and intersectionality more relevant than their lifes' achievements?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVjR04kQCQw
Must be nice to live in such a black and white world where things are so neatly categorized in good and bad categories
Non-binary is the new gay
Yeah how'd that taxpayer funded giveaway to the "ailing" airlines work out? It was meant to help them support the customer base they abandoned at the drop of a hat for retention by issuing refunds (that we all effectively paid for) and the still did not even follow through on that.  Nationalize these ill-willed, yet incompetent buffoons.
This is thinking way too small.
Canada desperately needs to establish a domestic semiconductor industry capable of at least producing PV cells (for future solar power needs). Setting up fabs for low-end chips (like most but not all of those found in vehicles) would be a natural extension.
We have the necessary mineral deposits and the expertise. All it would take is government investment. It is also the natural complement for domestic EV battery production.
I think that by the time the FABs get online there would save a glut of chips, which would make us question the investment.
Also don't see the point of a government led consortium.  What would be the value add vs a purely private one?
If the Americans do succeed in creating a new Berlin Wall, we may require the capability, but can we subsidize it enough to get it to the size required to be competitive with the trade deals we have?  
Fun stuff: Maybe some open source design could be our niche?  Some competitions? There are a lot of opportunities there.
More questions than answers on this.
Establishing a domestic high  volume semi conductor industrial plant would onshore critical manufacturing capacity for the 21st century.
The Government is talking about a lot of social programs; but this type of investment would be a much better one for the people of Canada.
The Chretien-Martin liberals should never have allowed Nortel to sell their fabs to foreign interests. There have been a lot of bad industrial policy decisions by both parties, but this was one of the worst.
We should adopt risc-v architecture, no need to re-invent the wheel. Proprietary architectures are not an option.
We are supposed to be pushing an AI center. Perhaps the hardware would dovetail. 
But the margins on these devices are extremely small. And it is a dirty industry.  Maybe if we focussed on clean/green ics and cells and started a certification program?  That could be something one could build a market on. Also, chips that are publicly specified along the lines of the raspberry pi or Adruno.  Say you'd prefer some security around your garage door opener where the the other options are all very proprietary.  And insecure once the model becomes obsolete and unsupported. A less disposable product line industry?
I'm in complete agreement  in theory but just to play devil's advocate in terms of feasibility:
For reference China committed 1.4 Trillion USD as a start to creating domestic Chinese semiconductors production in 2020, even this is considered too small of an investment and they are struggling to get it going - for comparison Canada's whole GDP was 1.6 trillion in 2020. 
They are literally spending equivalent to Canadian GDP with 1 billion+ educated workforce and struggling. 
What are Canada's chances in this insanely Capital + Education intensive market? I say nearly zero. 
All our best  engineers are already probably in the US working for US fab shops  so where does Canada find the Money + Talent needed to start this massive industry?
You have to remember currently Taiwan and S Korea produce the majority of the semiconductor in the market - they literally been going all in on tech and semiconductor since the 60s. To think Canada can catch up being almost 50 years behind is laughable.
To recap the difference in scale, CGL pipeline is 6.6 Billion and TransCanada is around 12.6 Bil. Canada started CGL in 2012 and TransCanada in 2013 - both are massively over-cost massively delayed and after nearly a decade still not looking like its going to finish. 
Canada can't manage low-tech grunt level project that is less than 1% the scale of the China Semiconductor program. 
Literally, we failed multiple projects that are just digging a hole and dropping a pipe. 
I have difficulty imagining we can start a domestic multi-trillion dollar industry that will require the largest investment in Canadian history.
P.S. (But I WANT TO BELIEVEEEEEEEEE)
What are you talking about with a Berlin Wall reference?
Definitely low-end semiconductors probably will stabilize and lead to a glut for a bit. Would make any low end Fab shop hard to justify as a fruitful venture. 
The high end semiconductors used in more intensive computing devices are the true prize countries are eyeing. 
>Also don't see the point of a government led consortium. What would be the value add vs a purely private one?  
 I believe the logic is similar to government led pharma consortium - bulk purchase as a country to have more bargaining power compared to thousands of individual Canadian companies negotiating their own terms.
The whole Nortel affair and aftermath was such a tragedy. Most Canadians still don't even understand what happened. How do you convince people to learn from their mistakes when they don't even realize the mistakes that were made in the first place? (Rhetorical, I wish I knew the answer).
Would they have been relevant nowadays?  i mean I can't see then being competitive.
I think that's a fine idea. Another nice thing about these 20-year old processes (and the commodification of the chip industry in general) is that all the kinks have been worked out so the same fab can easily produce multiple architectures without the need for extensive retooling. And unlike the newest processes, there is still a lot of commonality with PV manufacturing.
>Also, chips that are publicly specified along the lines of the raspberry pi or Adruno.  Say you'd prefer some security around your garage door opener where the the other options are all very proprietary.
If we could get government to push the IoT security/privacy angle, this could be a good path. It looks like both the Arduino and Raspberry PI are around the 250 nm process node, which is easy peasy to achieve nowadays. Aiming higher, even the 65 nm node is fabricated by all number of name-brand and knockoff fabs around the world, and would suffice for most of the chips that you'd need in a vehicle, for example.
Green angle is also good, as long as there is a mechanism to encourage use of these green chips, since they'll never compete on cost.
Because the US is forcing countries to choose between world power blocks.  If they are sucessful, we'll need more manufacturing capacity.
Ahhh, so this is the real reason an election was called early.

This will haunt us far beyond 2022. The thing about inflation is that once they tame it, prices don't go back down. Inflation may slow but prices will remain high until purchasing power catches up which can take a long time.
Homeownership has slipped away for many, likely permanently, and retirements are slipping away fast. Unless you have a government DP indexed to inflation or a portfolio sufficiently large that it can provide meaningful income on 3.5% withdrawals for decades, retirement is a Sisyphean task.
I called this back during the first few months of the pandemic once government money printing was in full swing. I got downvoted and criticized to shit.
Meanwhile **all the same assholes who denied the risk of inflation are now busy claiming that it is a worldwide problem that could not possibly have been foreseen**, ignoring that Canadian is leading the pack after the US. (That's only temporary too, we'll surpass their inflation rate once the BoC loses its ability to keep the lid on all of the deposits it is holding).
At this point I'd rather leave this country then subsidize those who were reckless with mortgages. I think the government wants this inflation, which is why they're keeping rates low regardless of inflation rate or unemployment rate. Inflating away peoples savings is a better solution (in their eyes) then the optics of the  housing ponzi scheme deflating. Your house is going to lose value, just not in $CAD.
Corporations need to feel the pinch, no more record profits while people can't afford food and housing. Inflation isn't what's causing prices to rise, that's just the excuse.
just think of what needs to happen for *anything* to get better
You’ll own nothing, and you’ll be happy.
Eat the bugs, sleep in the pod, wear a mask, two more weeks to slow the spread.
Thank GOD Justin Trudeau is bringing in 400k immigrants. At least my house will go up faster than inflation maybe I'll end up even
I already see it. Combined income of about 145K. We make it work because I work Saturday to Tuesday so I can take care of our toddler on thursdays and Friday’s while the wife works, so we get a bit of a daycare break there. Only downside is my wife and I really don’t get a day off together but sacrifices I guess. 
Groceries are consistently 250 or more when before they hovered around 195-220 even factoring in diapers and other household items. We’re buying the same stuff it’s just costing way more.
If it’s tough for us I can’t imagine how it is for families making less. Our government has failed us.
>Prince Edward Island, where Statistics Canada shows the cost of living   
has risen further than in any other province. Gasoline pushed close to   
$1.50 per litre in late October. 
It takes a push to get to $1.50/litre? Sounds like a day ending in "Y" for the west coast.
I planned for this. Inflate my mortgage away.
Inflation hurts those with less assets (house, investments, cars, luxury goods). It really is a vicious tax on the poor.
Thanks to captain Justin, Mr. ideology, this country is on the right track! Sunny ways! I don’t feel sorry for anyone who voted for this. Enjoy.
What has happened in Canada in the last 6 years? Oh, right. The liberal party was voted in twice
Is ok Justin. 
We forgive you for not thinking about monetary policy.
At this point, businesses that aren't affected by inflation will increase their prices just because it's expected.
Don't know where this will end...
Money printer go brr, who could have seen this coming
Ya the weston family is really going to feel it. “Nearly everyone”. What a joke.
so i dont understand....if prices go up so much and people cant afford to go out and do things or buy needless crap then the stores suffer??? like what happens when they have too much crap they cant sell cuz no one is buying?
Neat.

The news has to create fear out of weather.
Youre putting too much pressure on them. Theyre people just like you and I
I'm always amazed at the new meteorological terms I learn after these weather disasters. Superstorms ('Frankenstorm'), atmospheric rivers. They stick in your mind.
Meanwhile China doesn't care, underprices all these "low-impact" Canadian start-ups, and then buys out the resource deposits for pennies on the dollar when the companies go broke. In other words, the status quo.
The only way to become competitive with "climate-friendly" products is to place tariffs on imports from countries that do not have similar climate policies.
We cannot win with an unequal playing field.
Canada is a leader in mining in general. 
70% of mining companies are headquarter in Canada for a reason. 
We have great stories out of the mining industry.  And terrible ones.
How about rape-free and slave-free mining overseas
Pffffft. Canadian mining is probably one of the most irresponsible industries in the world.
Not a situation Canada can individually tariff itself out of.  Only has impact if you can form a coalition with a large block of countries to do the same.  Quite possibly the next huge global trade dispute because we've collectively spent the last 3 decades trying to find ways to reduce friction in global trade.
Think you're confusing mining with your iPhone.
>Not a situation Canada can individually tariff itself out of.
It is if you introduce uniform tariffs on imports from all countries without comparable climate policies.  You only need a coalition if you intend to single out some countries and not others and would like to prevent arbitrage.
So Canada introduces tariffs on its own.
All the other countries collectively shrug and go about their own business.
We're not that big a market, unlike the US, EU, or China.  Our trading measures only really matter if it's done in concert with other countries.
>So Canada introduces tariffs on its own.  
>  
>All the other countries collectively shrug and go about their own business.
Yes, and we go about our business by manufacturing our own low-emissions products, or trading with the other countries that produce low-emissions products.
Is that less rational than trying to produce low-emissions products and then compete on a cost basis with high-emissions products in the global market?
Because that's the current plan, and it won't work.
> or trading with the other countries that produce low-emissions products
this is called forming a coalition
In effect perhaps. But it doesn't not require any active collaboration before hand.

Unless you eat xmas trees they are not essential. Since 1996 my family has just decorated some item a coat rack a chair one year a bicycle. You can survive without an xmas tree.
something smells like gouging and less like pine.
That doesnt rhyme
No
Must be Covid
Good thing i have a fake one
I definitely need want a tree this year, but I would be happy with a charlie brown tree. It even seems a little fitting for 2021.
Joe Biden did this
Somehow this is Trudeau's fault.
https://i.imgflip.com/5virl1.jpg
I thought the majority of this country was irreligious
real christmas trees should be abolished
I think the trees are better served helping regulate our atmosphere for us than dead in the corner witnessing a commercial holiday for our amusement.  Can you not just spend time together and appreciate each other without demanding the killing a tree also?
I'm definitely doing a Christmas bicycle this year
we're decorating a smart lamp who's colours change lol, we topped it with an angel and wrapped tinsel around it
Putting up a tree is pretty pagan dude
Christmas is almost entirely pagan. I’m not religious at all and always celebrate Christmas, but back in the day I dated a fundamentalist Christian guy who refused to celebrate Christmas (along with the rest of his church) because it was entirely pagan. And the thing is he’s not wrong.
Yule is not necessarily a religious festival
1) I am an athiest, but I would never think of giving up Christmas.
2) You can be irreligious and a "cultural Christian" at the same time.
Been hearing this shit for 20 years...basically it means new records next year....
Nah. There wont be a correction. Don't believe the doomsayers. There will never be another recession, interest rates I predict will go lower actually. They should..rates are too high right now!!
Buy what you want. Canada is immune to any financial disaster.
Pfft old article it's from 2008!
/s we've been hearing this for over a decade now..
Lol. These announcements are like publishers clearing house letters in the mail.
Even after this bubble pops don't think you'll be able to get in on the action....theirs numerous numbered companies and lawyers with far deeper pockets than you waiting to scoop up the "cheap" real estate
Not sure why folks are rooting for the correction - it’s not going to make housing more affordable, there are people are sitting in cash right now, waiting for the correction so they can buy prime real estate for cents on a dollar. Look back at the housing crash in ‘08 and try to understand how that played out. I’ll give you a hint - home ownership rates have actually gone down.
yawn been hearing that since 2018. correction not happening as long as interest rates remains low
Trudeau: hold my beer! It's going to the moon!!
Even if it corrected by 10% which is a lot. Houses are still incredibly unaffordable.
[deleted]
remindme! 10 years
Any price movement down will be immediately filled with people already in the market looking or those on the sidelines waiting to jump in. 
We had over 80 showings on our house priced over $1m in 4 days; my coworker had 120 showings on a house in the $750k range. For anyone who hasn’t been in the market in a while, this is insanely high demand that I wouldn’t expect to vanish.
This is like the 100th time we were told this since the 2008 crash. I'll believe it when I see it 😤

Won’t happen.
Bank of Canada is like my 4yr old. Instead of saying I spilled the milk all over the floor, she would say “look there is milk all over the floor “.
I have been hearing this for years and years already. Shit or get off the pot.
Mr Macklem warning of this to make excuses about continuing to keep rates low, better start QE right back up again… what a goof, no one’s been more damaging to equality in our country in recent times, causing rapid asset inflation during a period where it should go down. The guy can get fucked.
Oh hey, look what I found the bank of Canada saying back in 2012.

No one would have ever guessed all those officer redundancies in the upper ranks (cause reasons) were because they're too handsy to stay employed for more then a few months at a time.
I’m for one glad to see this.  He’s been very candid and if anyone has doubts read his words for yourself instead of the headlines! BZ

"Canada-wide, I think it's about 87 per cent of 12 to 17 year-olds had at least a first dose. So if we imagine that five to 11 [year olds] would be around that same number, then that does boost the overall Canadian vaccination rate to closer to 85 per cent." 
Governments have made clear their intention to not require vaccination for the 5-11 group, yet they are assuming that the vaccination rate will be similar to a group that has had their rate impacted by the prospect of being subject to exclusionary measures if they don’t get vaccinated.

I think we should rename the island to Andrew Howick island (the dude that donated the island)
Good for him, can't say I'd do the same. I'd probably build my anti zombie fortress on the island.
Wow...What a magnificent thing to do.  Future generations will be thankful for this.
I'm not sure I understand? Why didn't he just keep it? 
He said he had the possibility to sell it but had "sleepless night" thinking about what the buyer would do with the land. So, how about just *not* selling it and leave it as is since you're already the owner?
A truly decent human being. They are all too rare these days.
Fucking legend.
This is so beautiful
A true Mensch.
Good for him. If more environmentalists took personal initiative and responsibility for looking after the environmental around them, we'd all be much better off.
What a legacy move. I can only dream of being able to do something so admirable
Nature Conservancy of Canada also accepts cash donations to help fund land purchases. Every donation is put to good use.
Absolute legend
A good part of my family lives in that area. The entire lake is in dire need of environmental protections. There are monstrous mansions that just sit there and do nothing but make rich people feel better about themselves. There are also concerns with a industries and a landfill dumping polluting water into the lake.

RMS Lusitania enters chat
Yes, of course.  I'm not going to helpfully clear the path for the US to invade, I'd do anything in my power to prevent a war.
If I thought that shooting down a plane would prevent a war, I'd happily push the button myself.
> If I thought that shooting down a plane would prevent a war, I'd happily push the button myself.
It's fairly likely that's exactly what they did. You can drive a big rig through the holes in Iran's "accidental shootdown" story. They may be incompetent relative to our standards of competence, but it takes more than incompetence to shoot down an airliner that departed your nation's largest airport less than 5 minutes beforehand.
How the hell are you equating shooting down a passenger plane with "preventing war"?! That's some weird mental gymnastics you got there.
I'm shakey on this theory because I don't think it's actually a good move on Iran's part.  It's just as likely to ratchet up tensions, or become an invasion pretext of its own.  
It's a little too much like the 'Trump is playing 4D chess'.  I just don't think Iran's government is that ballsy and that savvy.
Are you able to understand how clearing the airspace helps the US manage the blowback from an invasion?
You're questioning my willingness to use human shields to try and avert a war.  I'm saying not only am I willing to use them as a shield, I'm willing to go much further and murder them if that would work.
Not saying 'shooting planes is an effective strategy'.

Can we all agree this is racist as shit yet?
It’s controversial because it’s insane.
These anti labour measures seem like a great way to destroy unions.
I predict a lot more of these types of things coming, followed by a decrease in union membership.
Also, how do they intend to define who is racialized?
Are Syrians white? What about Greeks? Are asians white in this case or did they lose their POC status by being too successful?
Also, from the article it seems like this applies to votes involving appointed school reps. The smart move would be therefore to appoint a POC as your school rep, so you have more of a vote. I feel so bad for the people who have worked hard their whole careers just to be used as tokens.
Some Canadians are more equal than others. It's the popular trend.

>“If your school rep is racialized, then you get a higher percentage of the vote,” the teacher said.
Watch as a bunch of school reps suddenly discover they are metis from their grandfather's friend or something.
This is fucking stupid.
Edit: and it’s fucking racist
> If 50 per cent of the voting members present on any given issue are from Indigenous, black or racialized people, voting will proceed per normal. If, however, quorum is not so representative, the votes will be “weighted to ensure a 50/50 representation.”
this is so fucking strange.
Based on 2016 census 77% of Canadians are not a visible minority. How is it reasonable to expect 1:1 (POC vs non-visible minority) then?
So, I have a question then.
What if, there is 30% white people and 70% racialized people?  Does that mean that the 30% white people also get 50% of the vote?
Also, yes, the concept is completely racist.  1 vote is 1 vote.  It shouldn't matter what the colour of your skin is.  Period.
This is nuts
What is happening to Canada?
well at least they're not pretending anymore.
This is identity politics logical conclusion. Absolutely racist garbage.
This is absolutely deranged.
Challenge it in front a tribunal, see how it fares.
"We have heard from members at both the local and provincial level within our Union that Black, racialised and Indigenous members do not feel safe or welcome at Union activities"
Get ready for them to feel even more unsafe. The more you give favouritism to "recialized" groups, the more people are going to hate them. It's like taking two kids out for iced cream and giving two cones to Jimmy and none to Timmy. You think Timmy is going to smile and nod?
EDIT: I want to clarify that my comment is meant as an explanation ("this lead to Timmy pushing Jimmy into the mud"), not an incitement ("Timmy ought to push Jimmy into the mud"). This policy is folly because if fuels further hatred.
Favouring certain races over others for positions. What could go wrong?!
As a visibly minority what the actual fuck. I swear some of these policy’s breed white supremacists.
We trust these people with education why?

Can we just stop talking about COP26. It did what everyone expected……absolutely nothing.
Imagine holding an event for almost 3 decades and having nothing to show for it.
It's ok the USA sold a million acres of oil licenses in the gulf of Mexico on the same day as Bidens COP26 speech
Unless agreements and accords at these summits are made to be binding (hint: they won't), they will always just be political pandering.
Show of hands...how many people condemning this for not being appropriate in the face of the climate crisis have given up their ICE vehicle for an EV, public transit, solo electric vehicle (ie scooter) or a bicycle?
It's almost like the ruling class only cares about profits and not humanity 🤔
Agree, Without - USA, China, India onboard with making meaningful IRW changes these talks are almost pointless.
newflundland/Labrador is one of the areas where the transition to alternatives will be slower due to climate.
At least the oil companies were paying the US government and not the other way around.
Or continue heating their homes with natural gas or continue purchasing products made and / or shipped using petroleum products.
Virtue signalling and “rules for thee and not for me” are the calling cards of all good environmental activists.
Also, it's almost like leaders elected to short terms only care about things in the short term. 
I promise to be carbon neutral ( deceased ) by 2121.
Agreed. But also if middle footprint Canada cannot even make meaningful change, its no surprise the big ones dont. Sigh.
Nfld has an incredible amount of wind power, while they have been singularly focused on expensive hydro and keeping oil going, they could have been on the forefront of wind farm development and a flexible smart grid.
But this was something that needed to be embarked a decade ago. It's late now. But never too late.
Why? Do you think China considered scrapping their new coal power plants and then though *"wait .. Canada is still doing that oil sands thing?"*
normally talk gets shut down on the "winds too strong" argument and somewhat herded along to bring told oil is the only way.
(ya... I've prodded their argument once or twice and they weren't budging.)
> Nfld has an incredible amount of wind power, while they have been singularly focused on expensive hydro and keeping oil going, they could have been on the forefront of wind farm development and a flexible smart grid.
Oil and gas is valuable because it is easily exported. In 2019, [Newfoundland's oil exports of over $10B](https://lop.parl.ca/sites/PublicWebsite/default/en_CA/ResearchPublications/TradeAndInvestment/2020514E) were worth 7x more than [Quebec's electricity exports of just $1.5B](https://imgur.com/IRf26Bl).
I didn't say China's choice depends on Canada, my bad for giving the wrong impression. I am more making a human nature statement. If affluent middle-class economies like Canada, which have some privilege, cannot convince themselves to change, it's no doubt larger, more unequal societies won't care either. Not that their decisions impact each other.
Ah, gotcha. Yeah that's a pretty reasonable take.
>If affluent middle-class economies like Canada, which have some privilege, cannot convince themselves to change
No.
It has nothing to do with that and everything to do with providing reliable and consistent energy across the country. We still need oil and gas to heat homes and power transportation (not even factoring in all the other shit oil and gas ends up creating). We don't have nearly as many nuclear power plants as we should have if we want to reduce our reliance on hydrocarbons.
Also Canada desperately needs the money if we want to encourage any kind of investment into our energy industry.
Its all fun games when politicians make energy and environment promises that aren't actually feasible. The general population of Canada either doesn't give a shit or doesn't understand that you cannot simply convert to a "renewable" energy economy overnight. Making these bat shit insane promises that we can somehow dump oil and gas in the next... 10 years by increasing restrictions and regulations on it *today* is beyond stupidity.
Not sure why you are getting down voted….must be the whole not understanding category they fit into
The US, under multiple successive administrations, has defied WTO rulings and arbitrations and continues to act in bad faith.  They did it again with steel/aluminum and now they are doing it with autos.
America.is.not.our.friend.
Ah, that special relationship at work again.
**Does not matter if a Republican or Democrat is in the seat of the President... America only thinks about America.**
That is until it needs Canada.
**What Canada must do:**
Develop new partnerships with the rest of the world to reduce our dependence on the American market.
This also means better rail and port facilities to export to Europe and Asia.
This also means to improve the image of our industries by electrifying trains and machinery as to produce "greener" lumber and greener products and resources.
If Canada has the greenest products, than it will gain market shares over dirtier products.
**We need to invest in Canada to get our industries ahead of our competitors.**
aaaand we're hooped again!
Fantastic.
This decision yet again underlines the naive stupidity that permeates the Canadian Federal government. This is product of poor quality schooling and a lack of knowledge of the outside world.
Nations act in their interests, except Canada, of course.
They've been shot down by the trade tribunals every time they've tried this, and yet they still stick with the proverbial definition of insanity.
Back in the day, we didnt recognize their patents for pharmaceutical. 
Lets bring back generic medicine production India style, see how they like it.
So stop selling it to them and sell to another country.
Where's Trump to blame when you need him?

Even softwood lumber tariffs gets a reboot these days.
Will Justin Trudeau put on his stern eyebrows?
Deja vu.
Does this mean lumber will get cheaper in Canada as less is heading south?
Unless we poke them in the eye they're just gonna keep on doing stuff like that to us - Saying no to the F-35s would do that.
Canadian government subsidizes lumber doesn't it? So much so that it hurts American mills who want to export to Asia. Tit for tat if you ask me.
Round-and-round we go. Hypocrites.
Retaliatory tarrifs are in order.
Keep BC green, buy American wood!
They have no option but to buy Canadian lumber. The US can't grow enough of their own. This is a US problem, not a Canada problem. This is one of the items where Canada has the US by the short-and-curlies, and the Yanks hate it.
Does anyone know what the Americans do with the monies collected?  Give it to the wealthy landowners who wont compete on price.
Working in tech, it seems like the dream is always to move one country up in the paygrade. Lots of the hotshot Canadian workers leave for big US salaries. Meanwhile at my job I'm surrounded by immigrants from all over who are ecstatic at the relative earning power of their Canadian salary vs wherever they're from.
Apparently since I'm still here, I'm not a hotshot, or I'm weird and prioritize little things like "living close to family". But it's certainly not incentivized.
Are we now reframing record inflation as "a surging economy"? That's a kind of language redefining right out of 1984. The current state of our economy benefits no one, the instability from this inflation will cripple a generation, possibly 2.
> In Ottawa, the bet for Justin Trudeau’s government is that the formula of more immigration and more job creation will help quell inflationary pressures and create the kind of even and long-lasting recovery that makes Canadians forget about how they lost a chunk of purchasing power in 2021.
Importing hundreds of thousands of workers when we have a massive supply shortage and expecting inflation to go *down* makes literally zero sense.
Considering our housing supply crisis, perhaps we shouldn’t be expanding immigration right now. This is just a vote grab for the liberals at the expense of struggling Canadians.
Accurate. Eventually, immigrants won't see the value in coming here.
Only foreign press is willing to bring this up thanks to our free and open domestic media.
According to the political class, wages aren't "stagnate ". They are "mitigated". Y'all feeling mitigated?
"High levels of foreign-born workers, for example, have helped to mitigate wage pressures in Canada in recent months at a time when inflation has been surging."
https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/canada-open-to-ramping-up-record-immigration-new-minister-says-1.1684120
it's almost as though increasing the supply of something lowers its price...
"surging economy", you know there's nothing economists hate more than looking out the damn window. Go ask any average young person if they feel like they can afford to have children if you want to know how we're really doing
You won't see headlines like this on the CBC.
Your chance to score that high paying job is now. Its a small window before the borders really open up.
Canadians voted for this crap.
For once in our life we have a labour shortage. The ball was in our court to put pressure on improving working conditions and wages. 
What does the government do? 
Open the gates so someone willing to do it for less can undercut the progress. 
Our Immigration system is no longer sustainable for anyone.
This is how you end up with Trumpism/Brexit. Immigration increases GDP and evidence suggets it drives up wages for those who are skilled, but it supreses wages for unskilled labour such as hairdressers, landscapers, roofers, etc. This fact is burried in every academic study stating how immigration is good for the economy. If you're going to increase the supply of unskilled labour, you need to increase the social safety net available to unskilled workers or fund makework projects.
“Surging?’’ Give me a fucking break. 25% of Nova scotias youth are in poverty. A 30 year high
The feds really are trying to destroy this country, aren't they?
Bilingualism is really saving my ass right now. Tons of my coworkers are immigrants from the Maghreb or Haiti, but since English education in their country is terrible or inexistant I have a massive edge over them (English is NECESSARY for any promotion). If I only spoke French like them I'd be in a harsh spot and racing against time to learn English at a satisfying level before they did. I pity anyone who has a job where such no such edges exist that can protect them from wage stagnation or harsher competition for jobs and promotions.
&#x200B;
This is a banking job, btw.
Knock knock. 
Whose there?
Right-wing extremism
working as intended
No shit. Supply and demand is as close to a fundamental law as the social sciences get. Every kid should have concepts like supply and demand and opportunity cost drilled into their brains.
Immigrants to this country are in for a rough surprise when they move here and find they can't afford a place to live.
We should get a handle on this before real anti-immigrant sentiment sets in.
You can appreciate the immigrants you have and still say
“okay let’s take a break from new citizens for a couple years until we sort out housing.  This isn’t anything against all the new Canadians we’re happy you’re here but we need to chill for a bit”
I, for one, would love competition.
Let them all compete with each other and be forced to deliver innovative products at lower and lower prices.
Not even into weed, but competition is great.
They just want to compete with the other 5 pot shops within a 1km radius. 
More than half of these eyesores will be gone in the next 2 years.
They want their pot brownie and eat it too.
Gibmint is the cookie jar and it's hand is in it!
Thought it said pet shops
If you cant beat the incompetent govt I mean what's that say
The big issue is when the province sells it for less than a private store can, like in BC, because the province is also the distributor. They mark up what they sell to private stores, but not to their own stores.
It says that the game is rigged.
You expect private businesses to outcompete the government when the government in these provinces has a monopoly on all wholesale distribution of cannabis by law? 
The government’s retailers are able to access wholesale product through the only legal distribution, thanks to laws the government passed, while private enterprises have to buy wholesale product from the government at whatever price they set. Private enterprise could go to another distributer of wholesale product, except that’s illegal due to government laws. 
If there were 2 hockey teams playing a game, Team A and Team B, and all the refs were members of team A would you say team B  is incompetent because they can’t win?
The incompetent government that has a distribution monopoly...
Our household is dual-income, solidly upper-middle class (if that exists?) And we notice a huge difference in available $ YoY. The other day I walked out of the store, disgusted by the huge price differences and did something I havent for awhile, went to numerous stores to save some $.  (burning $1.47L gas the whole time)
I hear that this inflation is "transitory".  Now we just need the government to continue to redefine transitory.
Imagine how much better we'd be able to weather increases like this if we didn't already spend all of our money on housing.
It's okay because Gerry Butts says it is.  These people  don't care about these issues because they have people purchase and cook their food for them.  
These are poor people problems, so they don't matter. 
[https://twitter.com/gmbutts/status/1463169431463510018](https://twitter.com/gmbutts/status/1463169431463510018)
Good thing we have a PM who doesn't consider monetary policy and thinks the budget balances itself to sort this all out.
Yes, but let’s not talk about that in the Throne Speech or think about monetary policy, either.
Printing more money should solve it.
Lmao, and the dumb fuck politicians are all like "but why aren't they having kids even though we steal all their money and have banks give us large paydays to allow them to inflate real estate prices to the exact detriment of the people"
Got 4 bags of groceries the other day. Everyone I for was on "sale" and it's cost me $85. Going to be a rough year
Never forget that this is what Canadians wanted from a government.
Hungry people are dangerous people. Good luck Trudeau. If you dont fix it your party will be out for a much longer time next time.
If you look at a graph of the CPI and turn your head upside down, inflation is actually going down!
Housing prices have skyrocketed. Apartment prices have skyrocketed. Grocery prices have skyrocketed. Cellphone/Internet prices have always been sky high. Gas prices have skyrocketed. Tuition prices have skyrocketed. Gov't makes everything worse with their carbon taxes jacking up the prices of living.
Meanwhile wages, salaries for the average Joe barely change if at all. Minimum wage should cover the basics of living, a 1-bedroom apt, water, heat, phone, internet, food. Everyone should be able to afford these... right now that's not possible. Not without giving up some aspect of a basic life. It's bullshit that companies and landlords are allowed to gouge people during covid times.
Gov't doesn't care. They get paid. If only minimum wage went up as often as they vote to give their salaries a raise. Maybe fuck the carbon tax for a few years until people can afford to live again?
They told us inflation is at 3-4% though…
We all know Trudeau is going to do absolutely shit all. To be fair though, I doubt the other parties would do any better.
This is a broken system.

It's almost as if printing massive amounts of money devalues the dollar and causes prices to go up.
Weird huh? But spending good
Yet people keep voting for Trudeau.
Fuck Trudeau.
All the government cares about is internet censorship.
Ban Huawei.
Boycott Beijing 2022.
Ban the import of any and all products from Xinjiang province.
Ban foreign nationals from buying property here.
I’ll wait until something is actually done.
Ban Huawei and recognize and send an ambassador to The Republic of China.
Thanks for the laugh.
not a conservative but harder on china is the right way this is good
I am more concerned with the nation to the south of us as its democracy slips away. When they get bored of shooting each other , run out of drinking water and other resources they will start looking at ours.
Naw, we're just becoming more of an appendage for American attempts at maintaining their hegemony.
The responsible choice for a weaker power is to play the major powers off against each other.  With this shift, we'll lose any remaining leverage we had with the other dominant super power-- and then we'll *really* see who the rules in the Rules Based Order benefit. 
This is foolish short term thinking.
Plus what is this nonsense about Russia's opinion on China in the Arctic?  Of the comment was true, why is Russia building a string of ports to facilitate China's merchant fleet as they traverse their northerly passage?
Oh so we won’t have a prime minister praising a “basic dictatorship” anymore??
Agreed, but be real...our government has been bought.
I'll take 1 and 4 for the win.
1 and 4 with a side of 3.
Ban! Boycott! Ban! Ban!
Sounds sensible.
Very much a situation of "high hopes but low expectations".
The domestic conversation in the US means that a foreign policy change is likely. The Feds may not like having to shift, but at this stage, it's inevitable.
People can make some impact without relying on the government, just stop (or at least reduce) how many chinese made products you purchase.
More concerned about the company swimming in circles than the country that released 3 warships 2 long range missiles and actively runs concentration camps all in 2021, while rapidly seizing ports ready for military conversion all throughout strategic points in the pacific. 
I think the US isn’t a scare out of incompetence and too much comfort, where as China is actively agressive towards us
Oh please.  We're easily 10 years away before 35 million starving Californians roll tanks north.
That is easily the biggest threat for sure.
I think 2020 clearly showed that democracy in the US is resilient and working as intended.
They already have unfettered access to our resources.
That is what they wanted with Russia too but Russia won't play ball.

Were those couple dozen employees checking passports and boarding passes really hurting the bottom line, WestJet?
Well, this is gonna be interesting to see the results of.
How does this work with mandatory masking?
Next up: Social Credit System! Fun times!
Summary:
* WestJet and TELUS have teamed up for a first-of-its-kind trial in Canada that will see facial recognition used prior to boarding for some flights at Calgary international Airport.
* The process is touchless, and uses "safe and secure facial verification technology," the companies said in a release.
* The ongoing trial is the first step toward approval from the federal government.
* The technology was developed by one37 and document integrity validation is provided by OARO, which follows data protection and privacy regulations covered under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA).
* "The addition of biometrics to the travel journey provides a much improved airport experience moving us closer to a more safe and secure contactless travel experience," said Mike Maxwell, aviation lead for OARO.
is it just me who thinks people that oppose this stuff make about as much sense as antivaxxers? Surely this conspiracy is real.
It will be interesting to live in a world where facial technology is the norm. Every year we are getting closer to this happening. 
Although I have mixed feelings about it, I see it as a positive rather than a negative.
Well easy enough, another less reason to fly.  If I do it certainly won’t be with WestJet anymore.
Don’t worry, I’m sure they’ll both release a statement reassuring us nothing bad will happen. Then exactly what we’re worried about will happen will happen. Every fucking time.
>  I see it as a positive rather than a negative.
lol why?
>I see it as a positive rather than a negative.
why?
I mean, the election results were not much different than the one before so why would you expect it to change?
Because they knew their best chance of getting re-elected was to call the election before the reality of inflation and long term consequences of supply chain disruptions set in, best case in early public opinion polls as of August 15th when the election was called was a Liberal majority and a conservative minority was highly unlikely.
Even when shit went off the rails in Afghanistan, the Armed forces sexual misconduct scandals, Raj Saini, and Trudeau's inability to keep his feet out of his mouth on the campaign trail, a Liberal minority was still a possibility as NDP voters always fall for the conservative strawman argument and flip red when a Conservative victory seems likely.
Best case as of September 19th was a Liberal minority, a broke NDP and the CPC post election drama that always happens lets Trudeau coast by for at least another 18-24 months.
Worst case as of September 19th was the CPC gets in and actually deals with the economy imposing austerity measures and the opposition Liberals can pin the consequences of their spending spree on the evil conservatives for the next 18-24 months or the Cons don't cut spending and the fiscal conservative PC side of the CPC eats O'Toole alive after he's already alienated the social conservative Reform side of the CPC.
**Why did we have an election? The answer is:**
Trudeau just bought himself 4 years of government.
* The CPC is fractured with groups attacking their leader, thus it is weak.
* The NDP is not financially capable of fighting another election, thus it is weak.
* The Green just fired their Leader, thus it is weak.
* Mad Max is a joke.
* The Bloc does not care
**The result is:**
None of the opposition parties is willing to go into another election, so none of them is willing to vote against Trudeau and the Liberal party and risk another snap election.
This means that Trudeau has his hands untied to pass whatever policy he wants.
**What the future will look like:**
Until the CPC gets its affairs in order, Trudeau can sleep easy.
Because the NDP is closer to the Liberal on social policies, it will not force another election.
The Bloc has enough seats to prop up Trudeau.
**So, for at least 2 to 4 years, expect Trudeau to do whatever he wants and to get the support from the opposition, no matter the policy he wants to pass.**
He lost me at “labor shortage”. There is no labor shortage. If you can’t find employees during this crisis maybe, just maybe, provide a living-wage, for starters. If not, you’re literally working yourself closer and closer to poverty, than you’re getting ahead, relatively speaking. Many (most?) vacant jobs these days do not meet basic needs. If you think someone should work for wages below living wage, to keep your business afloat, you need to pack it in. Minimum wage is literally “I’d pay you less, but I legally can’t”. Fuckouttahere with that shit. $16 for a job that requires a university degree?!?!? Go fuck your hat. I’m not exaggerating. This is a job offer I came across a few weeks ago. I understand times are tough, budgets are tight, but minimum wage, unless it’s for very short probation period, isn’t cutting it.
Just what exactly did you expect it to sound like?
Narcissists gonna narcissist and call elections?
Ego stroking and to waste time. Also 600 million dollars. Parliament is now back in session after their 5 month vacation.
A lot of lower wage essential workers like PSWs, stand school bus drivers, warehouse workers, cleaners, etc. are moving out of Ontario because of very high housing costs to MB or Alberta. We do not have space for more immigrants within 200 kms of Queens Park in  Ontario until we build enough low income and affordable housing for those who take home less than 700/wk after income tax and child care and medical care and supplies. 
Solve these housing issues first, if not, more immigrants won't solve any labour shortage, immigrants are people too, they need affordable housings, more immigrants will only worsen all other livable small city/town housing affordability and crush their infrastructures. No housings for newcomers then immigration policy become a joke. $10 daycare is good but that is not priority.
Why? 
Because Trudeau was completely convinced he could win a majority.  There is no other reason he would call an election.
To satisfy Canada's most incompetent Prime Ministers ego.
Because it was 2021?
Because WE scandal had to buried deep, deep, deep?
Justinflation
Because we have elections through the Westminster system these journalists have had decades to understand politics and they don’t want to
Exercising our democracy is never a waste...
Really?  People still asking this same stupid question?
We had an election because there was too much politicking going on and not enough governing.  It was too convenient for the opposition to keep playing up the media about how everyone hated Trudeau so don't bother doing anything that makes Trudeau look good so they could up their chances of taking the PM's office with the next election.
So he gave them the election they were so eager for.  And now we're here.  The people have spoken.  The US has more ignorant, divisive politics than we do, but god damn to Canadians fucking whine so much more.
So he could try to avoid having one during the inflation shit show
Fuck Trudeau!
No new bills are proposed, trading barbs only. They are law makers. Policies are not laws.
Yep, this move to call an election was smart on the part of the LPC. What isn’t smart is Canadians for not seeing through Trudeau’s bullshit. 
I voted CPC, not because I love them but because they are the better choice in my opinion to deal with the crippling debt timebomb we now have. Basically 500 billion is sitting there at a low interest rate but it is a time bomb because we have zero ability to run a surplus under Trudeau and it is only a matter of time before Interest rates go up. It looks like this is going to happen sooner than the liberals anticipated or at least sooner than they said they expected because with inflation going up they have to raise interest rates. 
I am kinda hopeful that with the LPC left holding the giant bag of shit they created that Canadians will become a little more financially literate and realize what Trudeau’s wreck less spending caused. Only kinda because Canadians are actually a lot dumber than they give themselves credit for, they still generally talk about how PET was some great leader when he ran up such a huge debt that was followed by sky high 80s interest that we literally almost defaulted in the 90s. Jean Chrétien has to cut our public service and government spending so bad that Canada never recovered still.  Canada pre PET was actually a great nation, lots of good jobs, good debt to GDP, good healthcare, good military power for the size of our nation. We still have never recovered and our military and healthcare never has been the same since.
So PET almost caused our nation to default, maybe JT can finish the job his old man started
> as NDP voters always fall for the conservative strawman argument and flip red when a Conservative victory seems likely.
That's an odd way to put the blame where's due: with the over 10,000,000 Canadians who voted for the PC-Liberal one party neoliberal lie.
Cool so instead of lowering house prices we'll just make it easier to pump in more money and take on more debt. I'm sure this will not result in even higher home prices.
wow... yet another chance to improve home ownership that excludes the oldest millenials.
This is awesome except I've been saving so long I'm past the 40 year mark by a long shot. Why is therea an age limit???
This won't happen lol. Knowing government this was just a promise to get the serfs to vote for them. Let's hope I'm wrong tho cause this would be sweet.
Another Liberal Scam....
How is this not free money\*? I can't do this cuz I already own a  home, but, why couldn't someone just do the following:
1 - borrow 20k (this is easy, it's less than half my line of credit and I can borrow from my margin account too if I wanted)
2 - deposit 20k 
3 - deduct 20k from taxable income
4 - get money back during tax return. 
5 - now you have 20k + tax return money. Tax return money should be approx. 5k if you make around 80k ish
6 - pay back the 20k loan (interest rate for my line of credit is 3.7%)
7 - keep the 5k
Repeat this twice to max out the 40k limit.
\*Free money if you already have a decent job to get more benefit from tax deductions and if you are planning on buying a home.
RRSP already does this
What a disappointment
Wait, why can you only withdraw a max of 40k?  That part seems arbitrary, why wouldn't they let you drain it?  What happens to the leftovers?
"A home for everyone"  * under 40
This is the Federal Liberals we're talking about. By the time it might get implemented, they'll have fucked it up.
What if I own a home because I made a bunch of sacrifices? Do I get extra room in this thing?
Trudeau: Now you're getting it!
This why is there age limit. For any first time home buyer it should be allowed.
I know, the age limit is kinda insane, being that the not already previously owning a house seems like a fine limitation on its own.
A home for, almost, everyone!
Yeah, I am feeling the same way. Hope we are wrong though.
Nothing will work until unnamed corporations and foreign buyers are stopped.
>2 - deposit 20k 
>3 - deduct 20k from taxable income
Where are you seeing that the contribution is a tax deduction ?
Exactly. This is why I am hoping it happens before tax time next year lol.
I'll even take out my TFSA as well, and not need to take the whole amount as a loan.

“I’ve really changed this time babe, I promise”
For shame Beaverton.  It was very clear from their throne speech they are now open about not caring about Canadians.
I would have settled for that, but it's worse. Pharmacare is now officially dead. They didn't mention it at all in the speech, unlike their previous ones.
I’ll never treat you that way again.
Bam right in the wallet.
Oh so that's how they're paying for their ads at every single commercial break.
> The Dairy Farmers of Canada told Global News it wanted a bigger increase than 6.4 per cent. Exactly how much it wanted is a mystery, though, because neither it, nor the commission, will provide this detail.
> **The commission’s board is made up of just three members. Two of them own dairy farms and have extensive backgrounds in the industry. The third grew up on a farm and is the former CEO of the B.C. Milk Marketing Board.**
> The 8.4 per cent increase is the largest in history. It means dairy farmers will earn about $570 million more for the milk they produce next year.
So dairy farmers are getting richer by setting prices for their own products, while at the same time getting billions of dollars in direct cash payments from the feds:
[Dairy farmers will receive $1.75 billion in direct payments over the course of four years, with $345 million made available in year one (2019-20) and $468 million currently available under year two of the program. Another $469 million will be available in 2021-22, and $468 million in 2022-23. The owner of a farm with 80 dairy cows will be awarded compensation in the form of a direct payment of approximately $38,000 for each of these remaining years.](https://www.canada.ca/en/agriculture-agri-food/news/2021/02/latest-round-of-compensation-already-delivered-to-more-than-50-of-canadian-dairy-farmers.html)
The Dairy Farmers of Canada are raiding the public purse and effectively stealing from Canadians by setting their own prices. When do we start viewing these goons as a criminal organization?
Watch for a decline in demand. Followed by the rise of alternatives.
People don't need milk.
Stopped buying most dairy a long time ago. I drink mostly plant based milks and that's just to mix into my morning coffee. 
I buy a bit of cheese once in a while but definitely not a regular item on my grocery list.
Of course. This particular criminal cartel can never let go an opportunity to profit from their fellow Canadians.
You know what, this is it. I am going to make sure I purchase a container of non-dairy milk for every container of dairy milk. I have never liked any plant-based milk, but I like being extorted even less. I will live.
The politicians may be cowards but nothing stops us from collectively deciding to reduce our demand for dairy milk and boycott the milk mafia. #BoycottDairyCartel
big dairy is at a crossroads, people are waking up to the lies they've been spreading for decades. dairy is not good for you. its not necessary to consume, and its really bad for the environment. resist their marketing push, the tipping point is coming where we can put this entire industry behind us for the better.
The question to ask is is the price hike fair to farmers.  Our family were dairy farmers back in the day in Ireland and there was next to no profit in it?  It's a hard life and the best way on earth to grow up when you’re a kid but it’s worth noting that none of my cousins took over their family's farms either.
This is literally just a cartel. It’s despicable that it’s allowed to occur but politicians are self interested and often spineless so…
A great opportunity to try plant-based milks.
So at what point do consumers start giving the middle finger to dairy farmers in this country and say enough with the price increases? Surely there is a breaking point for consumers.
And I have family who are dairy farmers.
Better churn out more blatant propaganda about how your bones will rot or whatever unless you drink a litre of white water a day.
Lol dude this is just going to give me all the more reason to give up milk entirely.
The Government caved to the Dairy Producers demands, it's that simple...
Looking forward to the border opening so I stop taking it in the ass from our dairy cartel.
Are the farmers actually getting much out of this or just the Marketing Board?
Friendly reminder that grocery chains are recording record profits but blaming “inflation” for food hikes….
Don’t buy milk. Its not good for you anyway.
Transitionary.
Awful large amount of ignorance in this thread. Of all the things that inflation has increased the price of, milk is not the one that bothers me. The sheer amount of regulations and work that go into the milk industry are so far above and beyond that people considering the price hike of milk finally catching up to less than half of what everything else has gone up is beyond ridiculous. 
Y'all need some google or Jesus.
Somehow I doubt conservatives would do any better with the debt.
Oh look, here we are ....divided.  And for no good reason.  We are just not happy with either party.
The Conservatives agreed with the Liberals early in the pandemic to massive increases in spending, including the CERB program. Now, they backstab and blame-shift while they can't even figure out if Covid is a health risk for their own members.
Maybe, just maybe he needs to worry about the divisions in his own party.
So why are you creating divisons?
I think Conservatives are the source of self-created division, out of step with the majority of Canadians.
Ahh yes, nothing like the surpluses and unity the conservatives delivered on...
*checks notes*
... **never**.
Mulroney put us 10x more in debt and left shortly before the Bloc were elected **official opposition**. Harper never balanced a budget but oh boy were those mandatory minimum sentences for marijuana possession, "old stock canadians" comments, and "barbaric cultural practices" hotline... just sooooo *unifying*
Yes we are. Now get your party straightened out and start offering us a better option before next election. PS: Stifle the social conservatives and stick to conservative fiscal policy.
Ah yes, unlike those conservative run provinces that are totally not drowning in debt, of their own doing..
Well, Trudeau does want to spend a Billion dollars on a firearm ban / buyback program,  so I would have to agree here... How about focusing on out of control housing costs and the huge cost of living spike. I wouldn't have a problem with the Liberals if they focused on what matters instead of wasting money.
I feel like he needs to give his head a shake. Feels like people have been meeting their guard down a bit. Only thing I feel is cause some shit is the vaccine argument.
He's not wrong.
Today in Canada, a bumbling conservative blames liberals for all the world's problems. Must be a that ends in Y, eh? What's that all aboot?
OToole and the conservatives waste parliamentary time objecting to vaccine mandates. They think they're above the rest of us. The rules shouldn't apply to them. If drawing a line in the sand on the vaccine mandate when all other parties agree isn't divisive then what is?
Yes, and your point? 
Do something already!
Your all great at pointing out the obvious, but nothing changes.
We are drowning in taxes and hosing / living costs. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure that out. The question is, what are you doing about it?

**Ok, just a quick reminder of how money is made:**
For every dollar in existence, there is an equal dollar in debt. It is unavoidable.
So the more money people want on the market, the higher the salaries people ask for, the higher the debt must be.
No debts anywhere means no money anywhere, it is that simple.
**Why Trudeau's spending is not a catastrophe**
Because Trudeau used the Bank of Canada, which purchased tens of billions in Canadian bonds at rock bottom rates. That money will ever come due in 20 to 30 years and the value of that debt in 30 years will be less than its value today thanks to inflation being higher than the interest on the bonds.
**Essentially, we owe that debt to ourselves**
Second, the Bank of Canada can never go bankrupt, even if Canada does not buy back those bonds in 30 years, since the BoC is the one bank that "prints" the Canadian dollar. The BoC belong in full to the Canadian Government and any profits it makes on those bonds will be returned to the Government in the form of dividends. 
So the BoC will give back to the government the interests the government will pay on the bonds the BoC holds.
**A growing economy means a growing GDP which requires new money to be created**
So either corporations go into debt, governments go into debt or the citizens go into debt... But new money requires someone to go into debts. It is the only way new money gets created.
**Of course we could stop buying imported stuff and boost our exports**
But to boost exports means we must have a cheap dollar to make our goods cheap for foreigners to buy.
And telling Canadians they should stop buying TVs, laptops, computers, imported cars or imported foods is a tough sell.
**So if all Canadians want higher wages and Canadian businesses want higher profits, more Canadian dollars have to be created through debt in order to increase the size of the money pool... New debts, a growing debt is a sign that more money is available in the money pool.**
Yeah Canadians are drowning in debt under Harpers watch as well
If anyone thought CERB eg printing money wasn't going to lead to inflation then they're a fool
Erin, you voted in favor of this as well.
Good. Parliament's role is to oversee the activities of the government, and it can't do that if the government is allowed to defy lawful orders of record production from Parliament. The Liberals are behaving as though they have a majority and the ability to dictate what information is requested by Parliament, and that's not what we voted for. The opposition is right to hold their feet to the fire on this issue.
The Liberal Party was hoping they forgot about those
Maybe, he'll call another election to avoid this again.
“Government that is open and transparent by default”
What a joke!!
About time….
"Cdns deserve the most transparent and open gov. in the world."

[removed]
The guy was a spy and had access to super secret stuff. Thats why they want it released.
Problem is that it won't matter.  The Liberals have gotten away with so much so far, anything else just doesn't seem to much matter anymore...  The west needs to stop sending equalization payments to the east and allow Quebec to suffer some hardship. Then have a conservative leader that will stick up for Canadians as a whole and improve our economy first. Allow the east to benefit the west and vice versa.
Jesus christ Trudeau you've literally become Harper.
"ehhh... nah" - justin, getting away with it again

That whole incident was kept so hush hush out here
There was very little local media attention when that incident took place.
About time
At this point, I suspect the documents themselves are less important to the opposition than the principle that parliamentary privilege gives the House the right to compel disclosure of the documents.
Wow, some polis doing some work. How quaint!
They won't....
Look at all the people lined up hoping this will be the next WE Charity scandal...including the CPC.
Except it won't be.  And Trudeau had nothing to do with it.
[According to other people who worked at the lab](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/nml-scientists-speak-out-1.6090188), the firings had nothing to do with COVID at all, and were most likely based on allegations of sharing proprietary information with China.
But you get a bunch of people who love a conspiracy theory together and mention "Chinese scientist", "fired from virology lab", and "Wuhan" together, and that's all they need to know.  They're ready to write a tell-all novel on the whole thing just from those three sentence fragments.
When it comes to biohazard safety level 4 labs, Canada only has one.  China only has two.  It's not like China has a BSL-4 lab on every street corner, nor is it surprising that Chinese speaking scientists would be offered work to set up a new lab in China.  The list of people qualified to work in a BSL-4 lab isn't exactly a long one.
Something tells me that Trudeau will ignore those demands
The original Sars virus sample which got from there to China
then China made Covid-19 out of it
the fuck is this shit? Alberta Indigenous groups are making hundreds of millions off of oil royalties, they were some of the biggest supporters of pipelines. 
the only "indigenous" people who don't like are the one's who don't live in Alberta and don't make money off it, but in that case its not their land because it belongs to another tribe, so to call them indigenous is a lie
Pretty sure they've made a lot off of oil royalties.
But no other industries in any other parts of Canada
Some are loving it.

So, she's determined to live the traditional life with all the modern conveniences. It's important to fight for the environment but she needs to understand the Earth is always changing and they need to adapt the traditions to the new environment. Perhaps it's time to farm the traditional berries and herbs instead of foraging.

> Dr. Theresa Tam said a vaccine for some of Canada's youngest people could be a turning point in the fight against COVID-19
Dang she really said this? Seems like an absurd statement. How many kids in this age range have died from covid-19, or have been hospitalized with it?
Unless it’s a shot that protects you for life what is the point?
I’m not anti-vax but I’m not vaccinating my baby and toddler just because.
Science got kicked to the curb pretty fast the moment it became politically inconvenient.
No thanks.
Imagine vaccinating your baby for a disease that has not affect or killed any children 😂
Here’s a wild theory. You can look at Theresa and know that she has terrible breath. She’s all in on this whole thing purely because it normalizes mask wearing and lessens the amount of vomit speaking to her induces.
Disgusting.
Children are pretty irrelevant in the stats of covid but they’re pushing it on kids.
Covid ends when people stop complying.
Solidly in the wait and see category. There is barely a year of data for adults, and we have already seen dosages go awry with the 12-18 category. Covid has killed 5mill worldwide, but in the context of: elderly, comorbidities. 
Excess deaths as a % did increase abit YoY, In 2019, there were 287k, in 2020, there were 300k. In 2016 vs 2017 however, we see almost the same % increase, with no pandemic.
If you zoom out 20yrs, you will see a YoY increase every year as the population ages and death from any cause becomes more likely. 
What Im rounding to is that, if that % of excess were children or <18, parents would be banging down the doors to get their lil ones vaxxed, but they are not because the risk does not appear to be there from Covid to that age group, but we HAVE seen a reported risk from the dosingof vaccine. 
Before someone says ' but, chickenpox' again...pox makes kids sick, and its visual. Polio was/is a scourge for the young for millenia, same as measles and all the other 'common vax' . There just havent been that many cases of very sick kids from covid. 
You would think that would at least give PHAC/Tam reason to pause and research some more, if we are still, learning about Covid, as those same orgs and others often claim.
It’s really interesting to see the vaccine fatigue and this sub changing to anti vax sentiment over the last few months.
Yes, good news.  I want them to arrive in Canada as soon as possible, so other toddlers get to be the guinea pigs and I will hold off and see if the shots are actually effective this time around before making a call on this.
I know they will have been in the US for a while, but babies dont talk and can't tell their parents if there are side effects so the only way is to watch, and not get information from main stream media who are funded by Big Pharma.
These anti vax comments are sort of like people who ride bicycles without wearing a helmet in traffic.
"I haven't had an accident, I don't need it"
It’s absolutely absurd. 
Out of the million+ cases Canada has had, 17 deaths were <19 
https://www.statista.com/statistics/1228632/number-covid-deaths-canada-by-age/
The numbers are so extremely low that if something does happen with the vaccine it would be worse than the virus
The elites are twisted. They really do want us maimed and dead.
How many kids in this age range have died from or been hospitalized in Canada for Pertussis? Diptheria? Polio?
Yes, because it eliminates a lot of vectors.
You hear that everyone! This pandemic would be over except NationalEmployment21 is refusing to vax his little disease carrier every 6 months so now its all his vaccine-denialist fault.
This is what we're supposed to do now right? I've been busy at work and forgot what remaining narrow slice of the population we blame for all this now.
Because it’s somehow extremely difficult and dangerous to get a vaccine?
Lol.
I vaccinated both of my children for a whole host of diseases that haven't killed or affected any children in Canada for decades.
That's kinda how the vaccination program works.
All those rebates would have been better spent on broadening public charging infrastructure.
EV rebates for cars that only the well off-can afford and for which there are months long waiting lists for anyway...
EV benefits make sense if they go into to public charging infrastructure. They make no sense subsidizing private purchases.
I’m debating a model 3 but I’m fairness despite the environmental benefits I’m not the person that should getting a rebate. I’ll take it, but really?
I think there are better use of Canadian tax dollars then sending it to Elon
I got the M3 back when you could get $10K in rebates in BC. With the price of that car that keeps going up, if I was to sell it today, I would probably make a profit. Odd...
Maybe.  Just maybe.  People buying a 50k+ car should do it themselves.  With their own money.  Not tax payer money.
#did I trigger anyone.
I was seriously considering getting an EV, but without at the very least one of the two offering a rebate, I won't, at least not for several years. I want the range Tesla offers, and the fast charging. So I'll wait, and keep burning gas.
Electric cars are expensive to produce. Either increase the threshold or forget about the rebates. I know, people that own a Tesla are rich and all that but if the incentive is to get rid of ICE cars why does that matter? Btw, the people who I know who have a model 3 are not that well off. It's just a priority for them.
One less competitor for Corolla
Good. These rebates never made any sense anyway.
Canadian living in the States here - after weighing the pros and cons of buying an electric car in the States vs. buying one in Canada upon our return, we decided to order a Mach E GT in the USA to take advantage of the tax credits. We will import the car into Canada later. Canada's rebates could not compete.
Oh no rich people can’t get more tax breaks. Don’t worry the government will find a way to make the rich richer.
Can I get a rebate, if I buy an electric snowmobile?
Can I get a tax rebate for using public transportation or living in an area where I don't need a vehicle? No? Oh okay.
Corolla with an iPad.
Ah yes, those governments.
Taking your money in taxes and then giving it to people who can afford new vehicles, for political gain.
We don’t need rebates on higher end cars. You’re just helping the rich.  How about under 30k vehicles including hybrids?
Man I remember only a mere 2 years ago when I was getting downvoted to all hell when I said that carbon taxes only fuck over the middle and lower classes. Nobody ever stopped to think that hey, the upfront cost of everything is what's shitty to swallow for people like me. Even if I got every spent dollar back in April (which I don't), I wouldn't be able to afford an EV. But none of that matters to the bureaucrats in office or the slacktivist trust fund babies in the suburbs. I can always take the shitty and unreliable transit system or walk everywhere! /s
I am always surprised how many people are pro EV credit.
Maybe if it was means tested and only for people trading in cars that are 10 years old. 
But generally EV buyers don't need the credit, and if they are trading in a newish car (say 5-6 years old) it would be greener for them to keep it then buying another car.
Greenest thing we can do is keep what we already have for longer.
The rebate is the difference between me buying an F150 and an electric Kona. Suncor has got the charging network figured out as they‘re already coast to coast with Petro Canada stations everywhere. The private markets got this
A paid buffer so people aren't forced to come into work sick and infect other. Good. People first. And good risk management.
Paid sick leave will be standard for workers in British Columbia beginning Jan. 1, 2022, with a minimum of five paid sick days each year.  
B.C. becomes the first province in Canada to legislate this level of paid time off for workers who fall ill. This new workplace protection applies to all workers covered by the Employment Standards Act, including part-time workers.  
More than one million workers in B.C. do not currently have access to paid sick leave, mostly those in low-wage jobs, who are more often women or racialized workers.  
The paid sick leave protection will apply to all workers covered by the Employment Standards Act (ESA), including part-time employees. The ESA does not cover federally regulated sectors, self-employed workers and employees in professions and occupations explicitly excluded from the ESA.  
https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2021PREM0073-002235
Good. Hopefully other provinces follow suit.
>Feedback from the workplaces that already provide paid sick leave found that most workers take between zero and five days of sick leave each year.
.....Isn't that because that's how much their employers give them ?
It sucks that it had to wait til during a pandemic for this to be created.
I’m stoked about this. I also hate the people that abuse it. I work at a union sawmill and when the three paid sick days came about all the usual suspects who miss their shifts all the time were suddenly ill for three days.
Nice!
It is really a good move. In Australia, everyone gets 10 days of paid sick leave and you can carryforward it to future years. I missed this benefit while I was working in Canada.
This is a step in the right direction but what good is five days when covid quarantine is two weeks
Doctors note required
our company doesn't give their 10 hour shift people 2 days. instead they only give 16 hours to match the 8 hour folk in total hours.
Doug ford: um, yeah no.
It's not a COVID program.  It's a program going into effect in January that will be the province's permanent sick days policy.
Correct me if i'm wrong, but can't you claim EI for covid quarantine?
Does it actually say that some where or are you making this up?
I usually work 13 hour days but a "sick day" is still just 8 hours.
Holy shit that's petty!
> Your employer may request reasonably sufficient proof of illness.
https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/employment-standards-advice/paid-sick-leave
> may request
Does not mean required. Stop hyperbolizing, /u/ru4realyosir.
To anyone else reading, if your employer requests a doctors note for a single sick day say from food poisoning... find a new employer. It's a seller's market in the labour force right now. This' good news all around.
>find a new employer
Why didn't anyone else think of this. You're a genius and have just solved every labor problem.
The election ended.
If I was a liar.  And Canada keeps on re-electing me, despite my lying to them.  I would have to conclude that Canada wants me to lie to them and I would amp up the lies.
I'm sure they'll give us an update on this right before the next election.
Best we can do is increase immigration and print hundreds of billions.
Because they don't care about you. The Liberals and Justin Trudeau only care about winning votes and getting power.
[removed]
They care more about fringe social issues
People think the government cares and they’re being progressive voting for the red team lmao
acknowledging labour shortages gives the working class leverage to demand living wages, better to ignore and import more desperate immigrants
No more election, they don't need to pander.
They never cared, people need to start voting people out if you want action...
They won the election. "Thanks for the votes."
It wasn't a concern, it was a lie.
Buy hey liberal supporters love falling for their lies.
Today you can run a political campaign and not follow through with a single thing.
Just goes to show how blind some Canadians are.
Don't worry.  The caviar and champagne are well stocked at Trudeau's home.  
All is well.
I understand house issues having Canadians too divided, but not addressing the cost of food and consumption like oil and gas is so dumb from the liberals. Like do something
Hmmm politicians not following through on their promises after they are elected…..this must be the first time that has ever happened….
Liberals are just conservative neo-liberals with progressive sweet talk around election time is what happened.
“If I did it”
A tell all book about the murder of the Canadian economy.
Written by Justin “nice socks bro” Trudeau
You know, I'm beginning to think that Justin Trudeau never actually cared about non-rich people in the first place.
Pigs at the trough are full so all is good on the animal farm.
They should split into the red tories and the lizard people
I would have considered voting for O'Toole but it's gotten to the point that I can never vote for the Conservative party ever again.
Is he waiting for a participation trophy before resigning?
I feel for the guy too.. Hes actually 1 year younger than Trudeau yet he looks like he could be his creepy uncle.
The first week of the 44th Parliament is coming to an end & I can't help but notice the approach coming from Erin O'Toole and the Conservatives. It tells me what they're really worried about & gives a glimpse into where their focus is. It also tells me that we likely shouldn't expect much from them in the months ahead: [https://magpiebrule.ca/2021/11/26/true-blue-redo/](https://magpiebrule.ca/2021/11/26/true-blue-redo/)
recall elections please
I agree, have a real progressive conservative party again, and the dinosaurs can be whatever they want. They might not have the numbers to win anything, but at least the people who have too much self respect to vote for the fake entity that is Justin Trudeau would have something to vote for

Or how about more frequent elections? Put an actual fire under their ass for doing something unpopular.
Dude,  I voted to support a Mulroney government.  I want the PC Party back.
Dunno if this is always true. I was an LPC voter for years until i deepened my democraric activism and seen them for what they are: gatekeepers for corporatism. For the last decade my resolve deepens and i really truly seriously cant see myself voting for them.

You know that's a different person, right?
Sure, but I think we're both alluding to the same thing. The Conservative used to be the party of unsentimental analysis of what is real regardless of how things should be. 
Now it is anti-science and fact resistant.  Wonder if that has something to do with a huge block who wants to have their imaginary friend run the country?
True, good point. Can't argue with that.
There seems to be a *really* strong narrative going around on social media that the protestors are somehow angelic land defenders and everyone else is utterly evil. 
It's getting extraordinarily tiresome.
People get released more often then not, commonly with conditions. That’s pretty normal, and conditions forbidding them from going back are to be expected.
Terrorists. Took hostages. Charge with kidnapping x500
Anyone simping for oil companies reveals themselves as an existential enemy of future generations.
Its not a good look
Is the condition to lay down as we poison your land?
It’s doesn’t make any sense for the judge to impose conditions on reporters that infringe on the freedom of the press. The judge must have accepted the rcmp’s lies at face value. It will most likely be reversed in the future.

The RCMP are arresting journalists and breaking into these people's homes without warrants. The RCMP officers are breaking the law. If you stand on the side of corporate interests you don't believe in a free country.
You are basically guaranteed to be released unless you also have some very serious warrants and even then…
Our justice system has zero capacity, basically exactly like our healthcare for the past decades.
You're talking about the RCMP right?
It is not an oil pipeline....try again
It's not an oil pipeline. If your going to use insults get your facts in order.
Poison it with what, money? 
What's the issue with the pipeline anyway? Is it the pipeline itself, or what it represents, the oil industry?
The pipelines themselves are incredibly safe, there is very little risk of any contamination at all, as any leakage would immediately be dissipated in the air. There has never been a fatal injury associated with a pipeline in Canada.
More likely, the judge saw evidence that these "reporters" were biased and weren't objective in their "reporting".

Dr. James Hansen is correct, Canada’s CANDU is well regarded around the world. It runs on natural uranium, no enrichment necessary.
3.2g CO2eq /kWh for Canadian nuclear lifecycle emissions.
If you don’t know how astoundingly amazingly low that is, check out the alternatives…
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources
>If Canada is serious about a transition to a net-zero future, the government needs to pay more attention to nuclear energy, says one advocacy group.
That includes continuing to support the next generation of nuclear technology (known as small modular reactors, or SMRs), building new CANDU reactors, and refurbishing existing ones.
Chris Keefer, president of Canadians for Nuclear Energy, is worried that members of the new federal cabinet aren’t as keen on nuclear power as former ministers were.
He’s particularly concerned that Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault will block Canada’s nuclear expansion.
Before he entered politics in 2019, Guilbeault was adamantly opposed to nuclear power in his career as an environmental activist.
As for “which forms of energy will be part of tomorrow’s energy mix, it’s not up to government to decide which of these technologies will drive” the transition, [he said at a news conference in Scotland on Nov. 5](https://mobile.twitter.com/CanadiansEnergy/status/1458762783156322313). “It’s going to be up to the market.”Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada will continue to explore and support nuclear as it transitions to clean energy.
“I think we’re going to need every different alternative … pursued and explored fully as we try to get off fossil fuels, … and that means investing more in wind, investing more in solar, and yes, exploring nuclear,” Trudeau said on Nov. 2.
Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson also said nuclear is part of Canada’s future.“We’re quite agnostic (about) the technologies used for energy generation, but we’re in the midst of a climate crisis,” said he said on Nov. 5. “We have to be thoughtful and looking at all non-emitting sources of energy. The government (will) obviously (continue) to look at nuclear as part of Canada’s energy mix.”
Keefer is concerned that by closing the Pickering nuclear plant, Ontario’s greenhouse-gas emissions will spike. The plant is supposed to close in the mid-2020s and be replaced by natural gas.
Ontario generates nearly 60 per cent of its electricity using nuclear power, and nuclear played a big part in weaning Ontario off coal.Wind and solar will definitely be large components of the clean-energy future, but “they need to be complemented with an electricity source that’s available 24/7,” [said James E. Hansen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQhXPM30_6E), director of climate science at Columbia University’s Earth Institute.
“The only candidate we have is nuclear power.”With existing expertise in CANDU reactors and a nascent SMR market, Canada is extremely well placed to capitalize on nuclear energy, he said.
Any plan to fight climate change that doesn't involve a nuclear renaissance, is literally nothing more than a pact towards economic ruin.
being pro nuclear is political suicide, the truth doesnt matter
Unfortunately, being pro-nuclear is tantamount to political suicide, especially in other countries. (Germany is well known for hating Nuclear Energy, and pledged to shut down all 17 reactors by 2022.)
Nuclear Energy is one of the safest options in terms of death rates be TWh, both considering accidents (explosions, etc) and pollution. Nuclear trades blows with Hydro, Solar and Wind depending on the stats used.
Then factor in CO2 emissions, and Nuclear is still a leader. Then factor in that Solar/Wind isn't always available, but Nuclear is available 24/7 regardless of climate conditions. Nuclear is the way of the future until solar/hydro/wind can make more strides.
[http://www.world-nuclear.org/uploadedFiles/org/WNA/Publications/Working\_Group\_Reports/comparison\_of\_lifecycle.pdf](http://www.world-nuclear.org/uploadedFiles/org/WNA/Publications/Working_Group_Reports/comparison_of_lifecycle.pdf)
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle\_greenhouse-gas\_emissions\_of\_energy\_sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources)
https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/death-rates-from-energy-production-per-twh
Wind and solar have shown to do nothing but raise the price of energy on the grid.  If you are doing nuclear, which already doesn't emit CO2, then why do the wind and solar thing at all?  Because we feel like it's a penance to the nature gods?
I feel like Souther Saskatchewan is the ideal place to put a shit ton of nuclear.
Flat and relatively safe from natural disaster.
We should be building nuclear everywhere there isn't hydro.
Just build new power lines from Quebec if the liberals did this 15 years ago we would not be paying over .20 a kwh peak
>Wind and solar will definitely be large components of the clean-energy future, but they need to be complemented with an electricity source that’s available 24/7
If only there was something, something with water.

Future predictions:  
In the future, people will fear nuclear energy more than the Covid pandemic.
Our previous natural resource minister was at least aggressively pro nuclear,the current one.... Not so much
Seamus O’Regan I thought was doing an excellent job articulating the value of nuclear (deep link to example)  [https://youtu.be/cu1GIxigNyc?t=1988](https://youtu.be/cu1GIxigNyc?t=1988) when he was Minister of Environment and Resources. I'm not sure if that is why he was shuffled into Minister of Labour, I expect it was less to get him out and more to get [seemingly anti-nuclear](https://mobile.twitter.com/CanadiansEnergy/status/1458762783156322313) Guilbeault in.
>Germany
And how is it going for them, let us check.
>For, on the one hand, it’s perfectly clear that we’ll continue to obtain natural gas from Russia. However, it goes without saying that we want to diversify. We’ll therefore also purchase liquid gas – perhaps from the United States and other sources. We’re thus expanding infrastructure in all directions. However, I believe we would be well advised to admit that if we phase out coal and nuclear energy then we have to be honest and tell people that we’ll need more natural gas.
&#x200B;
Angela Merkel, 2019
Not one of the safest. THE safest.
NASA studied this a number of years ago. Nuclear is the safest form of energy generation per kilowatt hour - even safer than wind and solar
A diversified system is always a good thing, but yea a lot of people fetishize wind and solar power. They have taken on an undeserved moral dimension and people treat them like there are no costs or externalities associated.
Nuclear is good at base power but needs time to scale up and down
New wind and solar are cheaper than new nuclear.
Kind of dry though, may have issues with cooling ponds drying up.  Further North would be better.

Urging people to conduct a manual denial of service attack?  That might be a legal gray area and I hope the prosecutor looks at it.   The various cranks who try to obstruct the public from getting the help they need from the health system (whether vaccines or just hospital access) shouldn't be given a free pass.
We know anti vaxxers will go out of their way to impart their stupidity onto other people.. which means blocking them from making their own medical decisions.. yet God help you if you question theirs.
They are literally everywhere...
For a group that I assume is all about the government and people staying out of each others business... they sure do a lot of... getting in people's business.
More evidence that anti-vaxxers are socially irresponsible, emotionally impaired children.
I read that some schools are offering the vaccine but not all.  Sabotaging the appointment system  is the perfect opportunity to
 push to have all schools offer it.

Just about anyone can run for office. Far too often, they’re individuals looking to grab onto the public teat after running out of other options. Unfortunately, they’re also saddled with a lot of baggage. It may sound a bit cynical, but fucked-up guys like this are always emerging to prove the point. Ostensibly seeking to serve the public good and yet happily fomenting an effort to cripple the wobbly healthcare system. 
It’s a form of mental illness.
Let's see our resident PPC promoter, FlyingDutchman, defend this guy. I'm sure he'll come up with a good excuse.
Freedom of choice was always a bullshit talking point from Max. The PPC is the anti-vaxx, anti-mask, anti-science, anti-freedom party.

Anytime an article draws comparisons to a single other country with a world wide problem, you should always be skeptical of the research and journalist.
https://radonmap.com/
[Now lets see whos funding this research teams research:](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96928-x#Ack1)
>This collaborative work between the AAG and JMT teams was supported by funds from the Alberta Real Estate Foundation, Health Canada, and the Robson DNA Science Centre Fund
Lets see some more conflicts of interest:
>The third author on this study (TR) is a staff scientist at Radonova Laboratories, a private company who supply radon test devices;
tl:dr "academics" cherry picked a country to make the problem here look a lot worse than it is (it is a problem). And it just so happens that the funders and one of the researchers may significantly profit from the suggestion of building code changes.
I don't like telling whats supposed to be some of the smartest people in the world how to do their job. But if they didn't want me to point out conflicts then they should have done proper "sciencing" and done a comparison between a few countries. Not just one.
**For those wondering, Radon comes from the decay of the Uranium 238**
The entire chain is:
Uranium 238-*^(alpha)*\-->Thorium 234-^(Beta)\-->Protactinium 234^(-Beta)\-->Uranium 234-^(Alpha)\-->Thorium 230-^(alpha)\-->Radium 226-^(alpha)\-->**Radon 222**\-^(alpha)\-->Polonium 218-^(alpha)\-->Lead 214-^(Beta)\-->Bismuth 214-^(Beta)\-->Polonium 214-^(alpha)\-->Lead 210-^(Beta)\-->Bismuth 210-^(Beta)\-->Polonium 210-^(alpha)\-->Lead 206
**The half-life of those:**
&#x200B;
|Uranium 238|4.468 billion years|Stable|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Thorium 234|24.1 days|Unstable|
|Protactinium 234|1.17 minutes|Unstable|
|Uranium 234|25,000 years|Stable|
|Thorium 230|75,380 years|Stable|
|Radium 226|1600 years|Stable|
|**Radon 222**|**3.8 days**|Unstable|
|Polonium 218|3 minutes|Unstable|
|Lead 214|26.4 min|Unstable|
|Bismuth 214|19.7 min|Unstable|
|Polonium 214|0.16 milliseconds|Very Unstable|
|Lead 210|22.3 years|Somewhat stable|
|Bismuth 210|5 days|Unstable|
|Polonium 210|138 days|Unstable|
|Lead 206|4.5 billion years|Stable|
Radon is being produced every day and will keep on being produced for the next 9 billion years, until its original source (Uranium 238) is exhausted.
**So, constant ventilation is required to remove Radon despite its short half-life of 3.8 days.**
**Trivia:** The fact that we find Thorium 230 in the Earth's crust allows us to calculate the approximate "birth" of Uranium 238, which allows us to calculate the age of the Universe at 13.8 billion years.
**Trivia 2:** Since the half life of U-238 is 4.5 billion years and the Earth is about 4.5 billion years old, we can estimate that there is only half as much U-238 today on Earth than there was when the Earth was formed.
I'm in Montreal here, and everyone got a flyer from the prov. government last week warning us about radon, telling us to visit https://www.takeactiononradon.ca/, https://canada.ca/radon and https://radon.machealth.ca/.  "En raison de la COVID-19, les Canadiens passent plus de temps à la maison, ce quit augmente le risque d'exposition au **radon** pour vous et votre famille."
Insane since we now try to vent it and provude barrier or it could be that sweden has none and sask sits on a huge bed of uranium
We started testing our radon levels (Saskatoon) in the spring and were shocked to see the levels, varying from 150-600. We recently had a system installed and now it ranges between 90-120. I wish it was even lower but that’s as good as we can do without rebuilding our foundation. I heard that 1/3 of homes in Sask have higher than normal radon levels yet barely anyone checks.
Does radon cause mental disability? That would explain a lot about Canadian politics.
> "One of the important take-away messages is that we almost don't need to know, because we have identified a huge problem, and we also know that lung cancer rates here are higher than there – 163 per cent higher here than there. Yet smoking (rates are) essentially the same."
In a Tuesday news release, the U of C team noted that “radioactive radon gas inhalation is the leading cause of lung cancer in non-smokers and is responsible for about 88,000 cases of lung cancer in Canada since 2001.”
This is deeply concerning
Is that bad? What are they relative to a safe threshold?
Radon is the next big thing. Watch how much more advertising you see for Radon services over the next 5 years. This is internet marketers next kombucha
Yeah, because Canada is the biggest exporter of Uranium. We have massive deposits which naturally decay into Rado which will obviously affect our passive Radon levels.
This is like saying "Canada gets 10m more snow than Uganda every year! DO SOMETHING! PANIC!!!". it is simply a reality of living in Canada you will be exposed to more Radon than in Sweden, although construction should still take it into account and Radon pipes should be present wherever needed.
does this vary based on when a home was built? e.g a home built in the 80s vs 2010s
That appears to be a manipulative stat.
Just pick up the kit, do the test and mail it away for your results. Either its high and you need to try mitigating it, or its fine and you never need to worry about it ever again.
The test takes 6 months to a year to complete. You literally just put a small cylinder in your basement (some positioning caveats) and leave it there for months. You fill out some details on form, like timing and location, and then mail it away to a lab.
Mine came back at 42 +- 6.
New homes obviously are much more air tight than old homes. The radon either seeps through the slab, comes in through the sump pit or through cracks in the foundation.
Good airflow throughout the basement will keep levels manageable, but running an active vent from basement out the roof is the usually the best mitigation strategy.

$52 cost (for the test kit) for me to partake in a university study... hmm.
That’s pretty rad.
Ive been in my new build for 10 months. What should I be doing to avoid radon?
I've seen enough new home construction to know how shit these houses are being built.  Slapped up as fast as possible often even by cArPeNtErS with zero formal training or experience.  I'm talking houses with zero acoustical sealant.  Insulation crammed in the stud spaces as fast as possible.  Wood chips and dirt at the bottom of every stud cavity.  The list goes on. It's pathetic and embarrassing.  Good thing nobody cares though because we all know housing prices only go up!
Radon levels? 
Lol
Probably 467% of the cost too.
Would a Geiger counter at least be ok to use to just get a CPM value comparison over time of 2nd floor vs basement/1st floor?
That man had a very rough day.  Being brave providing a service in terrible conditions and surviving a huge ordeal, to going home to find his home has massive damage.   I hope he gets the relief he needs.

He’s the best PR guy the Liberals have ever had.
In a country in which 90% of the people are vaccinated, taking this very stupid stance is equivalent to political Seppuku!
They are effectively saying that they are above the simple masses who have to get a shot to get on a plane, train, dine in or have a job in many industries.
Ya know, I’d really like to see them mount an actual opposition to the liberal party, instead, all they do is stumble about with their peckers out.
This worries me, I don't want to become like the US, where their right leaning party has to take the idiotic and opposite stance on every bloody issue.
I don't want our conservative party head down t his path, as it drags their voters down the same ideological path, and it destroys entire political and stable systems, just like we see happening with the USA. 
The GOP in the US is highly radicalised and have no platform for many years now, their only platform is reactionary to common sense.
Well *I* formally object to Conservatives.
Contrarianism is such a shit ideology.
They are complete fucking idiots. If someone had this on their bingo card for political mistakes no one would have taken them seriously.
Stop being dumbf\*cks and become a real opposition. Dumbf\*cks.
“Conservative Leader Erin O’Toole attempted to find a middle ground.”
Of course he did. Trying to ride two horses at the same time with one ass - his specialty.
That’s how Trudeau will get his majority 😂 stupid fucks
O'Toole said he would end the pandemic during the election.... How would he do it? 
Canadians on mass support the vaccine mandates and the passport system. The CPC are very out of touch.
Who would expect more from the party that gave us the wonderful GST, eliminated family allowance cheques when my kids were young, scrapped the Avro Arrow sending hordes of Canadian aerospace engineers to the U.S, closed the CN Car Shops in London, ON and now object to vaccination rules in Parliament?  I am disgusted that they are even in the role of the official oppositions.  Send this party and their leadership to the trash pile.
"... Violates right to medical privacy...", Yet not disclosing an HIV or Hepatitis infection before having sex with someone is criminal. Conservative thinking aligns well with incompetence.
CPC has thrown in the towel and failed Canadians as the official opposition. Can we strip these useless saps of their pensions?
Once I saw "conservatives" in the title I knew it would be something stupid.
The CPC position is that disclosing vaccine status violates the right to medical privacy. First, this is not an enumerated right. Second, this stance fails to recognize an actual charter right, which is life liberty and security of person, which would include the safety of individuals required to be in parliament and other government buildings. Unvaccinated individuals are a health risk to others. How are these people law makers?
You would think after what happened to AB and SK in this 4th wave of COVID, and compare it to ON the caucus would shut up about vaccines. But here we are.
Wow, it's like they just don't want to lead the country.  They want to pander to crazy people.
Why do reactionaries get to ruin everything for everyone else by being selfish assholes? I'd really like our politicians to be on the same page here. Haven't we lost enough people already?
So fucking stupid...
A new highway won't solve Toronto's gridlock problems, at least not in the mid or long term.  The 413 might alleviate congestion for a couple of years at best, but induced demand will kick in and the 413 will become a mess like all the others.  And that'll be before all the thousands of acres along the proposed route that are owned by party-friendly developers are turned into more SFH suburbs and strip malls that will add even more traffic.  At that point, there will be the inevitable billions more spent on widening the highway in order to "alleviate congestion" and the cycle continues.
But sure, build the 413.  By the time the naysayers are proven right Ford will be long gone anyways.
The only long-term solution to the GTA's gridlock woes is to get more cars *off* the highways.
No it won’t because it won’t change the fact that whoever designed the 401 past McCowan fucked it royally.
The DVP piles on to the 401 at bayview and then you go from 3 lanes to 2 near Yonge street collectors then a little further down you have the Avenue express exit which if you actually take that exit, have to cross 4 lanes in 10 seconds to get to the exit. 
That’s not even mentioning eastbound with some of the lanes at or past Leslie and near Warden being simultaneously an exit AND merging lane. 
Truly mind boggling.
You know what would help Toronto's gridlock problem? THE FUCKING 407!! Barely used because we paid to build it and now pay a foreign investor to fucking use it.
If the 407 was actually used close to capacity (if we weren't being raped by foreign investors) the 401 wouldn't be so congested.
This is nothing more than DoFo going after the rural vote and setting up future conservative governments with a valuable asset to sell to a foreign investor to "balance the budget" - thanks for that assholes.
From my perspective the big problem with driving in Toronto is not enough arterial roads and exits. You can have all the highways in the world, but they are exiting on to narrow roads connecting to streets like Bloor or O'Connor.
Cars expand to fill the highways. It won’t work and then it will be worse.
Why not we extend the subway in Eglinton all the way out to Courtice? If I want to get to work (which is in the central west end) I need to take the Union and than a separate train and then either a bus or walk 25 minutes.... or I could hop on one subway and be within 10 minutes walking distrance.
European and Asian countries do this so much freaking better.
More highways=more traffic=more gridlock. How is this not common fucking sense by now
Build more roads…. More people will drive causing more traffic. It’s a never ending cycle. You’ll never be able to not have gridlock. 
The best way to reduce gridlock is to promote work from home, promote transit, promote living density and lastly, promote bicycles.
The roads we build increase the distance people need to travel in their daily commuting activities, forcing them to use their car. We use cars because we build roads, and we build roads because we use cars.
The cars and car infrastructure are very expensive. A single average car cost more than what many people earn in a year of labor. So, because we use cars to go to work, we go to work to pay for the cars we use.
Those are two very toxic loops for stupid people. When you consider that cars are inherently dangerous and requires the sacrifice of human life to use, well, let's just say I'm not happy with society's decisions. 
Unfortunately, people don't understand much and believe that cars give them freedom. Good for them.
I wonder if he has land on the area or his asphalt business will do the job
I'm just here for the "Induced demand" comments and the inevitable people who don't believe it's true.
waste of money, why not build more subways? incompetent province and conservatives
This is asking the wrong question given confounding variables like population growth.
The right question (at least for those few of us who still care about the economy) is whether it will increase transport capacity? Hard to see why it would not.
False .. if his hands are in it . Then it’s for his own financial gain.
Oh shocking, are you telling me that the majority of Ontario traffic isn't actually east/west, like Doug seems to want to pretend it is, but is actually north/south like every single person that has ever had to drive in this province knows it is?
The solution to the housing problem is MORE HOUSING!
The solution to the traffic problem is MORE ROADS!
*sound of mental gears grinding*
Buy back the 407
I bet a shovel doesn’t hit dirt until at least 2040.
I'd rather have more infrastructure than less. This will help significantly to encourage people to move further North which will benefit everyone. At the moment almost all of the GTA's infrastructure is located along the lake which makes no sense given that we can't build homes on the water.
Let's build up the North so everyone doesn't need to come down here and cram themselves in like sardines just to get to work.
A new Highway will help , its not a fix all but it will help, now to those says less people or less cars is the anwser , its not possible, it will never be possible, Toronto and The GTA were never designed properly for such population and the long distances, too many commute great distances and to ask them to give up the convenience of their vehicles or the locations they live is NEVER going to happen. I dont know the solution, its not like we can go back in time and properly plan for efficient infrastructure, doesn't matter what side of the debate your on, you're on the side that makes sense for you. 
If those that say that this new highway is going to hurt the environment, that may be true but if you are really concerned about that you wouldn't have  purchased a home that was once farmland or wetlands.. you cant have it both ways and if you want to stop progress sell your home and go live in the Forrest
That's good news.

I'm willing to pay a little more.  And over time they'll have the expertise - and cost will decrease as companies find efficiencies and alternatives.   
And local transport vs international shipping is better for the environment.
Win - win.
Good please don’t shift back.
Good- this is what we need and I'm willing to pay more for something 100% made here as well
They'll forget what they learned here after a few years. Especially the publicly traded ones.

Amazing.
Thats great. now if only Trudeau could get on bringing in some immigrants to the factories to work at the same Asian wages we would be set. Maybe some sort of temporary foreign worker program? 400k immigrants is not enough to fill these jobs at such low wages that allow corporations to make gangbuster profits. We need lower wages and more migrants
Agree, if anything the pandemic has shone a spotlight on Canada's lack of manufacturing capacity and our vulnerability to supply chain problems in procuring essential goods.  Adding to your point about the environmental benefits,  rebuilding/developing domestic capacity creates opportunities for companies to take advantage of new  technologies in their manufacturing processes.
Yup, there's a lot of benefit to bringing manufacturing back this way, and I don't mind paying a bit more for it.
Except it’s not a little more, it’s a lot more. And people really aren’t willing to pay more, everything already has gotten far more expensive.
How do you square this perspective away with peoples fear of current inflation levels? This will be a driver of inflation and I doubt efficiencies will decrease costs anywhere near the levels you expect.
Not really. Their commercial jet division wasn't profitable and their only potentially profitable aircraft wasn't marketable due to some BS trade wars with the US. They sold a majority stake of that program to Airbus, which is far more capable of manufacturing, delivering, training, and supporting those aircrafts. 
&#x200B;
Their business jet division was always their bread and butter anyway. It's sad that they couldn't make commercial work but at least they are still market leaders in something.
Next step is to find out where we are over paying and find a way to help Canadians save money by cutting down wasted spending
We tax the rich 90% of their money and institute a corporate tax as well.  
There's lots of money to go around, it's just going to fewer pockets.
We aren't over paying. Our imported goods rely on no transport/environmental oversight and slavery to subsidise our goods. We aren't paying enough. Global free trade is one of the largest root causes of environmental damage and human exploitation. 
We need to shut down as much unnecessary overseas trade as possible.
We don’t have to tax the rich at ridiculous rates. When you’ve got $100 million a 10% tax rate is still a lot of money, and probably more than they’re paying now.  Honestly a flat rate across-the-board would be better. Whatever you make you pay 10% of your net income.
North America experienced its greatest advances when we taxed the rich at 90%. All the prosperity our parents and grandparents enjoyed was because of this tax, and strong labor unions.
Also, no one person needs or deserves to have more money than some countries.
I’m not disagreeing with you except that if you don’t make it palatable they’ll just move their money offshore. It’s already happened.
Can't we just use the horse shit being peddled by politicians and antivaxxers?
Going to be interesting to see how this plays out. This years crop i paid about $240 per ton. Next year im being told "$800, if we can get some."
I'll grow my own food, with black jack and hookers
Pre world war 3 sucks
If you come suck out my septic you can have it for free.
labour shortages, resource shortages, inflation, shipping delays, medical care burn out, unaffordable housing, wage stagnation/income disparity, pandemic(s) will only get worse as climate change increases. This is the downfall of humanity, today is worse than yesterday but better than tomorrow and that cycle will repeat in perpetuity. But what we need is laws about not being mean on the internet.
Who had fertilizer on shortage bingo?
Yikes, maybe I should invest in tons of freezers and stock up before it gets **worse.**
Not sure why farmers are hesitating. Prices won't be coming down anytime soon.
Damn no shit
It's just transient guys no need to raise rates 😂
All part of the plan.
yikes! fingers crossed for you to get some at all. Thank you so much for all the hard work you do in keeping us fed. love from BC
Not a farmer, but curious what product you are referencing?
Organic and cruelty free ofcourse?
Pretty much :(
None of this has anything to do with climate change.
It definitely feels like the Bronze Age collapse in the modern day.
Uuuugh. That's a terrible Idea. Freezers require electricity. Learn to make preserves, develop a root cellar, put in a garden at home, and other much more effective low tech solutions.
Or you could just invest in Nutrien
When asked, "what part of Canada is divided?" O'Toole responded, "Have you even seen the Conservative Caucus?!"
He’s not wrong. Canada has never been so divided. Even here in Ontario there’s a certain smug from homeowners and those who don’t own. 
This country is going downhill fast.
I agree.  The annual national deficits and total national debt are staggering. There will be consequence. I've also personally never observed the extent of division between people and groups that I now see.
Losing = being "divided" now to conservatives.
I love how r/quityourbullshit this comments section is
Please stop stoking the ‘divided country’ narrative, O’Toole. It does nothing good and only further creates division and anger.
Whether people want to accept it or not, the country is very divided. How can it not be? There is a huge geography that is very hard to govern under one set of rules. Living in rural Sask, I certainly don't have the same concerns as someone living in the GTA.
Off the top of my head:
East vs West  
Rich vs poor  
Quebec vs everyone else  
Homeowners vs home seekers  
Boomers vs every generation after  
Indigenous vs everyone else  
Cars vs public transit  
Firearm owners vs firearm scared (I can't think of a nice name for this group)
There is much divide. Most of it comes from people trying to control other people with what they think is best. Reality is that I don't know what's best for you, just like you don't know what's best for me, and either of us forcing the other to comply to our thought process is wrong.
More and more it seems the right wing in this country is adopting the American style of politicking.
I hate that the opposition party will oppose everything the governing party does because they are the opposition.
Until O'Toole forces his caucus to be vaxxed, he won't be getting much attention from me.
"The other guys are divisive" is a little rich when your party counts members like Pollivre, Lewis, and Gallant, as well as O'Toole's own comments about those on the left. 
Besides letting the budget balance itself what are you going to do O'Toole?
Typical conservative playbook.
O'Toole is a antivaxx nut job now.
Its funny that the tool doesn’t realize that he’s creating the division
Absolutely, Canada is more divided now than it was before he became leader. He has alienated many people by making his opinion the opinion of the country. And frankly, I doubt it is even his opinion, just the opinion he thinks people want him to have
I wonder if your racist and Xenophobic take Canada back ads or rhetoric in the campaign trail had anything to do with it ?
O'Toole then went back to Alberta to tell them Trudeau is to blame for all their woes.
Ah yes, the Conservative, the party known to balance a budget. /s
O'Toole the O'Foole. Conservatives are so out of touch with the majority of Canadians they might actually lose Alberta.
Yeah, so what??? 
If you would have run a good campaign and not dodged so many questions then maybe you could have been answering questions on your throne speech LOL
Oh, I thought this was a Beaverton article because of the state of the Conservative Party...
> The report notes that at the current pace of lifting children from poverty — 24,200 children moved above the poverty line in 2019 —  it will take Canada another 54 years to completely eradicate child poverty.
What crackshot analysts these people must be. 
Here, Ill save them a ton of time - Canada will **never** completely eradicate childhood poverty.
>Sarangi says policies introduced during the Trudeau government's early years — primarily the Canada Child Benefit — had a significant positive impact on child poverty levels.  
>  
>Those gains are now slowing, she says, because the government has not adequately expanded benefit programs, nor has it made it easier for parents to access the programs.
&#x200B;
>The Liberal government introduced Canada's first national poverty reduction strategy in 2018.  
>  
>"Lifting children out of poverty is a top priority. Evidence shows that children who grow up in poverty are more likely to remain poor as they age," the report notes.  
>  
>Sarangi said Ottawa's recent lack of action and urgency does not suggest that it truly considers child poverty a top priority.
For those who say the CBC has no bias, here's a perfect example of them subtly expressing that bias. The things which are positive are the "Trudeau government" and the "Liberal government. The things which are bad are "the government" or "Ottawa."
> A national coalition that advocates for children and families says Canada's mission to eliminate child poverty stalled during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the group is urging the new federal government to take bolder and more decisive action to protect children.
uhhhh a lot of things stalled during the pandemic. This is just an easy sound bite.
I'm shocked that the government isn't directing it's resources efficiently and effectively.  /s
And here I am thinking they did a great job introducing the CCB and all the other benefits for families during covid. The CCB alone lifted so many families out of poverty. Maybe we need to look closer at our provincial governments, where welfare and disability payments are barely enough to cover a room in a house anymore let alone support a family with kids. OW gives you almost $700 in Ontario if you have one kid, and it's not much more for ODSP. How are you supposed to support a child on such a paltry amount? The social workers tell you that with CCB topping you up you should manage. But with housing costs and inflation going crazy, that can be difficult. 
The feds introducing a childcare deal helps as well.
The Liberals hate you if you're poor.
And higher up the forum I read about how they can't decide if they want to spend 18 billion dollars on F35 or Gripen fighter jets. They need to get their fucking priorities straight.
The government is not omnipotent. It cannot solve everything for everyone.
Agree about the CCB.  When Trudeau was elected my CCB doubled. That has got to have helped people.  The fed govt essentially buys all our food (and I am not at the poverty line at all)
It should try at least solving some things for some people.
Child poverty is not a priority for you ? Well, that's not the society I live in.
"mission to eradicate" is a fallacy predicate. Cleaver writers use impossible mandates to elicit outrage. Anyone disagreeing with the new groupthink is attacked or dismissed. Welcome to social media.
That's totally irrelevant to the fact the government has a responsibility to society to resolve child poverty. I couldn't care less if CBC sensationalizes it somewhat, the children in poverty and the lack of actual resolution is what matters. Canada has an exceptionally poor record on child poverty.
"Resolve" is a much different word than "eradicate".
Canada has an exceptionally good record on child poverty. According to this Unicef report, our government reduces overall child poverty from 26% to 14% after taxes and programs are factored in. Given the geographical and cultural expanse of Canadian society, "eradication" is simply not rational. Our government is doing good work on this issue while attending to many other priorities of the nation.
https://www.unicef.ca/en/our-work/article/unicef-report-card-10
What's the point of your link ? It clearly states Canada is doing poorly. 14% child poverty, "top of the bottom third". That's not good. That's not an accolade. That's pathetic with what Canada is capable of.
My comment was up for over a day before you replied. Why wasn't it a priority to reply? Unless you were out eradicating childhood poverty, there's *no excuse* for having other priorities.
Right?
So me not wasting time on Reddit every day and the government not resolving child poverty because it refuses to properly regulate business with social policies is not related. Period.
I doubt you've saved any children from poverty. Have a nice day.
The Jagmeet defending a pipeline. Is it backwards day and nobody told me?
>He stressed that he still supports the “national” position on the project expressed by Singh, who opposes the pipeline expansion in principle but is not calling for construction to stop.
20 bucks to anyone who can make sense of this paragraph.
Keep telling yourselves there’s no bias against alberta in Ottawa. It’s politically popular to dump on alberta but when the rubber cuts the road these politicians are horrible hypocrites.
Singh speaks so passionately on this issue, but he thinks “not so fast” when it comes to halting construction. What a lying loser.
Until Alberta and Canada transform the energy sector to be less dependent on oil of course no political party leader is going to be against pipelines. 
We gotta keep these folks employed. Does us no good if we don’t have enough replacement jobs if we just terminate an entire industry.
Peter Julian means what he says and says what he means.
Jagmeet...not so much.
So how’s the temporary shutdown of the current TransMountain line going for those out in BC?
"He stressed that he still supports the “national” position on the project expressed by Singh, who opposes the pipeline expansion in principle but is not calling for construction to stop."
No, they're just two-faced bastards.
The NDP are the party of unions. The pipeline is union work. Pretty easy to connect the dots there.
These a holes really do talk like they are against anything but it is really in support.  Slimey
Politics. 
Should I PM you my PayPal?
Its a desperate and pathetic attempt to try and take different positions on a single issue.
I don't need $20 that bad.
"this is unpopular so ratings will go up if I disapprove it but we're broke".
It's a super convenient way for him to virtue signal that he cares about the environment while simultaneously trying to appeal to people who support the pipeline as well by saying he doesn't want to stop it's construction. Basically he's trying to win over separate sides of argument, or perhaps more aptly, he's avoiding taking a side at all.
I say let them swim in the dark.
To us plebs it's business as usual.
Pulling in fuel on barges from the states isn't great, gotta say it's probably better to use a pipeline than that but for now we have gas in our cars and home furnace.
If your salty comment was implying that BC can't survive without a pipeline, you're mistaken.
Anyone still fooled by jagmeets BS clearly aren't paying enough attention. Pure virtue signalling
> The NDP are the party of unions.
Not lately they haven't been.
The pipeline is not confirmed to be union work. It was originally planned as contract work, and their was no celebratory announcement to make it union.
Put some effort into it.
Crash?  How can you call being shot down with a missile a crash?
>Those killed included 55 Canadian citizens, 30 permanent residents and dozens of others bound for Canada, as well as nationals of Britain, Ukraine, Afghanistan and Sweden.  
>  
>...  
>  
>The families enlisted a retired Toronto police homicide detective, Mark Mendelson, whose consulting firm examined a laptop and cellphones returned to the families. He concluded the devices “showed evidence of human manipulation” and showed no evidence of burn patterns or other signs of damage consistent with the plane slamming into the ground.  
>  
>“The fact that these memory/data components are missing is not consistent with damage caused by a sudden and hard impact. Moreover, the fact that screws were removed and covers pried open strongly suggests that concerted efforts were made to extract these components, rendering a review of data impossible.”
Why the people behind it, needs to he brought to justice. Good thing the Quds Forces is a terrorist group in Canada, why does Iranian government protect them, even on crimes like this.
Why did we just ignore this? Some great Canadians died that day. How long was the flag down for this?
Holy shit, that's beyond mustache-twirling movie villainy.
I guess the author doesn't wanted to offend by jumping to conclusions...
Exactly,  The crash was the result of being shot down
Liberals and liberal media love distorting the truth, altering facts to create their own version of reality. They have no shame.
What the fuck
Because they are a part of the Iranian government
"I had a car accident"
"What happened?"
"someone put a bomb in it"
They don't want to offend the ones that blame Trump, for Iran, shooting down a plane from their own airport.
The story raises the possibility the occupants were not killed by the missiles, but by the impact with the ground — and that the Iranian RevGuards fiddled with the evidence.
>The Canadian government rejected the Iranian report, calling it as “incomplete” and devoid of “hard facts or evidence.”
Iran looks for evidence----Those bastards!
The report was made by victims' families, right? They are going to paint Iran as willfully shooting down a civilian commercial jet if they can.
This case A missile exploded in proximity to the plane and shapnal ripped the pilots and some passengers to bits
People find ways to blame Trump for everything, to a truly comical extent.
I was waiting for Trump to retaliate that night. He did against Syria for a lot less and never waited for the details.
The people in missile batteries in Tehran would have been the first to go if he wanted to retaliate significantly. 
No country has ever attacked a US military base like Iran did and certainly not without retaliation.  (Retaliation somewhere--not necessarily the attackers-so you never know. Iraq and Afghanistan come to mind.)  Some mortars by some irregular group maybe.  Never a large missile strike from a nation-state.  
Nothing justifies shooting a civilian airliner. But some things help explain it.
In the end, Trump sensibly did not retaliate.  It was likely the brass saying: no way, no how.
Are you saying Iran didn’t shoot it down?
I know!
I’m guessing the retaliation was on the way, maybe even hours from go, but once the airliner went down from a SAM, the US didn’t want Any US assets anywhere near the site.
17.2%
I think the bigger question is how much to tip once the Ontario minimum wage is raised for servers to the same wage as everyone else.
Restaurant prices will obviously rise to account for that. Should we still tip the same amount or lower the tip because servers are earning more and don't have the reduced minimum wage?
I top pre-tax amount and 15% if I eat in. Don't tip on takeout. Rarely don't tip and will tip more when I get repeated great service from familiar servers. If I get bad service I just don't go back. 
COVID's completely changed things for me though. Think I've sat down and eaten in a restaurant maybe twice when it wasn't work paying since COVID kicked off. No intention of changing that.
I don't eat out much but when I do go to a restaurant I typically tip $10 in cash regardless of what I order, that said I haven't been to a restaurant since covid started
edit* if the service is shit sometimes I won't tip at all though.. This isn't the US where some states servers are getting like $4/hr
I love not tipping, I save so much money.
I still don’t understand why no one cares about the cooks, they’re being underpaid and the tip out you get is basically change compared to one server makes a night. I was a cook myself and let me tell you servers are going to be fine, the cooks are what you should be worried about with shit tip outs and the servers make more than you. People will leave. Tell me your a server, and you make less than a cook in Canada that isn’t a chef. I’m waiting…
[removed]
I usually tip between 10-15%
How does this compare to 2 years ago? I tip more now because they’re having to deal with all sorts of crap.
If the service is good, 
I'll leave a loonie, if its great, I'll leave a toonie.
We tip 20% min unless the service is horrible. Our regular servers that we like we tip 30% or more quite often, and they take very good care of us! 
My Wife works weekends at a 5 star restaurant so knows firsthand how difficult the job is, and how unbelievably horrible some customers can be. She also has to tip out 5%, so when people don't tip it actually costs her money to serve them...
Now that CERB has ended, I have began tipping at restaurants again.
As a former server/bartender I usually tip about 20-25percent, paying with my card but tipping in cash so there’s no record of it.
>I think the bigger question is how much to tip once the Ontario minimum wage is raised for servers to the same wage as everyone else.
Ontario, Quebec, and BC are the only provinces that have had a lower minimum wage for tipped employees in recent memory. If you'd have tipped the same on a trip to Manitoba as you do at the local TGI Fridays, there's no reason to switch it up now.
Especially in Canada where servers aren't paid like $2/hour like in the US. I usually tip between 10-15% for average service 20+ for great service and 0 for bad service.
$4 an hour would be a blessing in some places.
Spitting truth here. This was the case when I worked in restaurants. Servers got the same wage as we did (which has been the case in every province except Ontario, Quebec, and BC this whole time). We got a $50 tip out every other week. They would routinely break $200/shift in tips on weekends. And when it came time to clean, move things, or do literally anything difficult or dangerous, you can bet they weren't calling the servers over to help.
Seeing a bit of "as a former server/bartender" in here. Well, as a former cook, I tip as little as I can get away with without attracting social disapprobation unless the service was exceptional. And before someone accuses me of just being cheap, if they've really gone out of their way for me, or I've significantly inconvenienced them somehow, I've tipped as much as 300%. I just don't think I owe you anything for doing your job acceptably.
>She also has to tip out 5%, so when people don't tip it actually costs her money to serve them...
That's not normal, and it's not a societal kind of not normal.
Not much in what you've said is normal. If the job is so hard, then they should be paid more. If that's not possible and would kill restaurants, then so be it. If asking to tip out on their own salary is ok, then the system is broken.
Why support a broken business model? So that some people can be "entrepreneurs"?
The misers don't realize that servers lose money on a bill when they don't tip. The server is essentially paying money to serve the miser (and that miser is probably not an enjoyable person to serve either). I explained this once to a table of crows who racked up a hefty bill and didn't leave a cent on the table. They had the balls to try to get me fired for calling them out on it; I was fortunate to have management stand up for me instead.
Leaving no tip is a good thing to do if the experience was lousy and the server was brutal. Beyond that, a good server providing good service shouldn't lose money to cater to a guest's demands. Restaurants aren't charities.
I don't understand people who whine about tipping. They're the sort who are already complaining about menu pricing. If we abolished tips and jacked up the price of food more, heaven help these gripers. They wouldn't even come in to eat.
It's best to ignore the cheap asses.
Wait were u not tipping because of cerb?
I don't understand, she says low skill immigrants were hit hardest by unemployment during Covid 19, but we raised how many more people we are bringing in because of a labor shortage?
Also, that is an insane amount of kids in poverty given our population. 
Maybe not suppressing wages and improving the cost of living would help?
People are basically choosing to be poor went they choose to have kids now, which explains our fertility rates.
I suspect this number is a low estimate with many more living in functional poverty due to high cost of living in the region they live in
>The report, published Wednesday by Campaign 200 -- a non-partisan, pan-Canadian network of 120 national, provincial and community partner organizations working to end child and family poverty -- found that in 2019, 1.3 million children, or 17.7 per cent, were living below the Census Family Low Income Tax Measure After Tax (CFLIM-AT).
Why is this group not using Canada's official poverty line calculated by Statcan? I don't doubt there's child poverty in Canada, but that 18% figure is absolutely absurd. What's the methodology for this CFLIM-AT measure?
It's not like Canada's official poverty lines are too conservative or anything like that, if-fact they're among the among the highest and most generous in the world. [Here's some criticism from the right from the right-wing Fraser Institute](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/studies/critical-assessment-of-canadas-official-poverty-line) claiming the lines are too high.
That and this paragraph
>a non-partisan, pan-Canadian network of 120 national, provincial and community partner organizations working to end child and family poverty
makes me think that this group is pushing a agenda. They claim to be non-partisan (a claim CTV uncritically regurgitates) but at the same time are a political advocacy organization "working to end child and family poverty", presumably through more government spending and intervention. That would explain their decision to avoid using the official line and instead use one that makes the problem appear worse than it is
Let’s import more!
Nope, Justin said they eliminated child poverty. I believe him.
Canada needs to take better care of its own. So much for bringing millions of families out of poverty. All this borrowing isn't making the future for poor families look great.
Labor shortage isn't real, they say that when they don't want to pay higher wages, there's plenty of available workers, they just refuse to work for poverty wages.
As I stated in the above thread, they have 18 billion to spend on new fighter jets and this kind of bullshit is happening.
So that’s about 600,000-1 million people that should not have had kids.
>
>People are basically choosing to be poor went they choose to have kids now, which explains our fertility rates. 
I'd feel guilt if I ever brought a person into this world only to suffer poverty.
>she says low skill immigrants were hit hardest by unemployment during Covid 19
How do low skilled immigrants come to Canada? 
I've been researching paths to immigration and the main path, the point driven system, won't allow for low skilled immigration. You basically need an in-demand college or university degree and good language skills to be permitted to come.
Is there some other manner in which they come in?
>Also, that is an insane amount of kids in poverty given our population. 
This is due to their ridiculous and irrational definition of poverty. They use the percentage of children living in families that are in a particular bracket relative to the median income. That means if everyone were millionaires, everyone making 500,000 or less would be "living in poverty".
When you account for "big city salaries" pretty much everyone making middle class wages in rural areas is suddenly "living in poverty"
their labor jobs that probably pay min wage or little above.
how are they suppressing wages?
Canada's poverty line (or should I say *lines*) accounts for regional variance in cost of living
EDIT: I should have read the article before commenting, this group didn't even use Canada's official poverty lines apparently, but some other measure entirely (CFLIM-AT), I'm assuming it still accounts for regional variance but I can't be sure. And to think that 17% CP rate looked off
A lot of families don't start out in poverty, but sometimes life happens and things don't go as planned.  While I don't live in poverty, my life has not gone as I so perfectly planned back when I was in university.
This is the reality for most of humanity for all time. Not sure why you'd feel guilty about something which is pretty much the normal experience.
Let me introduce you to Roxham Road...
>won't allow for low skilled immigration
You haven't researched enough because it absolutely will.
Check out what NOC codes allow for our hardest immigration path, and it's all downhill from there.
If you have enough money to attend one of those smaller sketchy colleges as an "international student" then you can get in the country and work  and make money to help offset your living costs. Then they end up applying for PR after being here for a few years "studying."
I have no idea, I believed the same thing. Maybe through work visas when companies complain they can't find anyone and have to recruit outside of the area they are operating in? But I don't know if that has a path to permanent residency.
Everything I read on these issues confuses me. I have a few friends who did it through University, getting the degree and then getting recruited etc.
TransMountain expected to restart on Friday - the crude will flow again in 2 days - nothing like pandering to more fear.
Necessity will be the mother of inventiveness
They need to shut all the pipelines down
Ita the media's favourite thing to do
I'm confident those affected by this will appreciate this wisdom.
Why don't you start with your own house?
The economic impact would be devastating, but if that happened there would at least be a silver lining. 
- the enacting government would be turfed, even possible they'd need to exile in Guatemala. 
- the majority will demand pipelines be built north, east, south, west, all the way to Timbuktu and back to ensure energy security while the economy transitions at the proper pace.
What a well thought out idea
Nobody really picked up on the sarcasm with this comment here. You should all lighten up a bit!

> Bank of Canada warns of a destabilized economy as interest rates are set to rise
LOL.  These fucking clowns - as if they haven't played a major role.
The previous warnings were worrisome but nothing ever really came of them. These ones however, with the current other factors, I'm actually relieved we just renewed almost half a percentage point lower than our previous term and locked that in. Going to grab some popcorn for this 5yr stretch.
Article text:
> **Morning Update: Bank of Canada warns of a destabilized economy as interest rates are set to rise**
> OMAIR QUADRI
> PUBLISHED 5 HOURS AGO
> Good morning,
The Bank of Canada is warning that high levels of household debt taken on during an extended period of low interest rates and a frenzy of real estate investment could destabilize the economy as rates start to rise.
Canadians who stretched their finances to buy into the white-hot real estate market are highly exposed to rising debt servicing costs, Bank of Canada deputy governor Paul Beaudry said Tuesday in a speech about the stability of the financial system.
> The risk of a housing market correction has also increased over the past year as investors flooded into the market in a speculative rush, he said, driving up home prices and exacerbating Canada’s housing affordability problem. The average home price has jumped more than 30 per cent since the start of the pandemic.
> Liberals focus on climate change and pandemic in Throne Speech
The Speech from the Throne delivered a stark warning about the planet’s future as Governor-General Mary Simon opened the 44th Parliament, describing a world “in danger” from climate change and urging legislators to turn “talk into action.”
The minority Liberal government’s plans emphasized limiting greenhouse-gas emissions, and highlighted two other key campaign pledges – “getting the pandemic under control” and growing a “more resilient economy.” The speech mentioned the economy often, but had just one reference to inflation, which is leading to the biggest surge in prices in almost two decades.
Edit: formatting
Fuck all is going to change, and housing prices are going to continue to rise and more people are going to drown in poverty while Canada becomes a bigger money-laundering haven. This is a corrupt country.
"You guys better behave or I swear I'll do it. I really mean it this time! I'm not kidding"
CMHC could get busy here pretty soon.
How much can they reasonably raise the rates without toppling everything over? 0.25% ?
Don't worry everyone, our politicians will be fine and won't feel a thing
Let it burn
'Homes inflate themselves.'
Wait, that's not it.
And the previous 10 years of fundamentally the same policy
To be fair, we probably experience it differently than he and his cabinet does.

Wait wait wait. So you mean to tell me that the BOC lowers the rates to stimulate economic activity and encourage people to borrow and is now saying that what they did to try and boost the economy could end up destabilizing it?
This economy needs a reality check - so annoying that being up to your eyeballs in debt is better than having any savings.
These clowns are gonna raise it 0.25 to try to scare investors. Raise it by 3-4% if you are serious.
They are deluding themselves if they believe they can raise rates. Rates have been decreasing for 40 years because government expenses aren't sustained by its revenues, so they keep borrowing and decreasing the weight of their debt. 
BoC doesn't worry as much for inflation as it worries about other things like employment and the enrichment of capital owners. They'll do everything in their power and then invent new powers to use before they raise rates for any significant amounts.
I’m surprised that more companies don’t turn down the regular testing thing, too. That decision usually puts a significant new cost on the employer, who typically pays for the testing.
2 morons from Northern Buttfuck Alberta quit because of mandates!? Now the union has to do their due diligence and stand up for them, otherwise they will be sued for not doing their job.
Please fire them, free up some jobs for guys like me

Weren’t you guys all supposed to get laid off like 10 years ago. Should have stopped door to door mail back then.
The entire country should stop using Canada Post and just let it die.  It's the worst off the worst and there isn't a single worse courier.
Baffling
The biggest failure of our system as it pertains to covid is not insulating unions from being sued from their represented workers.
It's a somewhat good system pre covid, but with how covid vaccination  has been politicized a union should have zero responsibility to fight for workers as it pertains to a company introducing a mandatory vaccination policy.
Yes, there should be jurisprudence and case law established around a defensible vaccination policy (giving time etc) but even with that, we're so late into the game it's ridiculous we're even dealing with this anymore. 
Honest good people (less than 1%) will be granted the medical exemption and be accommodated. Unions are now currently responsible to protect the other 99% pieces of human filth jeapordizing the safety of their own colleagues and becoming an overall drag on our economic and healthcare systems. It's actually amazing that almost every single vaxx person I've come across directly is an illiterate piece of shit. You'd think there would be a more diverse group of them but there's not.
Edit: you can't make this up, the vaccine is allegedly now gene therapy. Keep it classy reddit.
You can’t spring this on us! We haven’t had enough time to decide! There hasn’t been enough research on the side effects! It’s only a cold!
Most of the companies i know that are allowing regular testing is on your own time and dime.
That cost should be passed on to those employees that choose that option.
Its can be rational, an outbreak is worse.
All employees had to attest to their vaccination status by Nov. 12th. If you didn't, you received a registered letter to your house reminding you that you have to attest or you will be put on leave without pay. 16,000 letters were mailed out to employees. That is almost a third of the workforce, not 2 "morons".
Previously unemployable people like you? I feel like there must be a reason this would be what it takes for you to get a job.
Odds are you wouldn't stick with the job, it's a 10% retention rate at Canada Post, only 1 of every 10 people stay or make it through the hiring process.
Anyone noticed how these weirdly smug wackos are -only- online ever since mandates kicked in? They're just not in real, in person society any more. My breakroom got de-boomered and it's honestly refreshing.
Translation: Watched a video on Facebook filled with misinformation and conspiracy mongering and bought into it no questions asked in order to feel a part of something subversive.
Seriously? Are you $#@&$#?

Why it took Canada so long to approve Johnson vaccine? At lease it’s just one shot
just admit that this is Genocide
But why? It's less effective and has a worse safety profile than the mRNA's...
[removed]
Has there been any studies of using this as a booster? I got my mRna and antibodies from a previous infection. If I get this I'll have one hell of a diversified portfolio
Edit. I was being tounge in cheek. God you guys are sensitive
💯
Single biyearly shot
A single shot is incredibly effective against hospitalization and death, that efficacy has not waned. If you're trying to avoid all symptoms all together, boosters are an option. 
I don't care about the cold like symptoms of a breakthrough. I got the J&J and will not be getting boosters.
Most of this person’s comments are regarding the vaccine. Take from that what you will.
One shot until you need the additional shots to keep your privileges
Ok I admit it.
Where are we, an Israel-Palestine post?
Some people may have allergies to the mRNA vaccine, others such as those in the homeless community may not be able to keep track of multiple doses and regions may not have the capacity to keep track of those individuals, etc.
The safety profile is only marginally worse. Its  safer than AZ, and that killed all of 6 people in this country. J&J is just 1 shot, and while it's not as effective, none of them are especially effective over time at preventing infection, and J&J is still pretty good at keeping people from filling the hospitals or dying. More choice is better. In the first week of offering J&J to Albertan's, they got over a thousand people vaccinated who otherwise wouldn't have been. Everyone who cares about the best efficacy has already been vaccinated anyways.
More options
For young men under 30 you avoid the myocarditis risk that both mRNA vaccines have. It's also much more proven tech, as J&J has been using this same design of vaccine for ebola since 2013 or so. That's way more data on long term safety and efficacy than we have for mRNA vaccines.
I feel like many people would like to have a regular vaccine option.
some people make the argument they don’t trust mRNA cause it’s too new. Gives them one less excuse. Also some people really hate shots, where a single shot is preferred. But at the end of the day we r basically shooting for the bottom of the barrel.

America taps it's strategic oil reserve, we tap our syrup stockpile...
It's impressive how much of the world's maple syrup comes from Quebec acericultors:
2020 production:
* Quebec: 13.21 million gallons
* Vermont:  1.95 million gallons
* New York: 0.80 million gallons
* Maine: 0.59 million gallons
* New Brunswick 0.56 million gallons
* Ontario: 0.47 million gallons
* Wisconsin: 0.27 million gallons
The reason for having a strategic reserve of maple syrup is precisely to avoid shortages and price hikes in lean years.
So good on Quebec producers to have the foresight to store syrup in case of emergency.
And anyone who claim that a maple syrup shortage in not an emergency is lying to himself.
Thank goodness. 🤤
God damnit, I am *not* going back to table syrup.
SOMEBODY THINK OF THNE PONKANKS
🤤 Now we can weather through any problem.
I had a maple beer once and it was horrid.

Indigenous languages are important and should be protected, iv been looking to learn Michif myself.
Linguistic diversity is a source of strength. We must do everything possible to further fracture society.
That's why the US and China are such failures.
Why exactly?
Not sure what you are getting at.
You’re not thinking critically if you are saying it divides society to preserve Indigenous language. Linguistic diversity isn’t a societal problem and even if it was it wasn’t what made the US or China succeed
If you are going to obfuscate what you are actually saying do it with sense
Learning new languages is quite fun and it can give you cultural context you didn’t have before. Highly recommend.
Because culture is important to preserve for people especially small rural communities. It’s important because it is self-determination and it gives many people hope and purpose for their culture which is not something to scoff at even if you or I cannot directly understand
He’s getting at “Indigenous culture deserves to disappear off the face of the earth” because of his weird and memetic understanding of what a fractured society is
Throughout history, the countries with the least cultural and linguistic divisions have been the strongest. We are promoting weakness.
Agreed! It can also be very healthy for the mind. Better than crosswords or sudoku.
>self-determination
Is having more and more groups asking for self-determination something that benefits the people of Canada as a whole?
Meh. People are weird. It’s a defunct old language. Same as hundreds before it. Let it die.
No.

Bullshit. To pick a few long-standing and stable empires that were never monolingual or monocultural:
Ottoman empire, Roman empire, most Chinese empires, most Persian empires, the Aztec empire, the Empire of Mali, the Holy Roman Empire, etc. etc. etc. In the nation-state era, yes, many nations used homogenization to their advantage, but that does not mean the only way to 'strength' is through homogenization. This is an ahistorical statement. 
Also, who says being a big military-heavy, economically unequal society like USA or China is even 'strength'? I'd rather live in Canada. And increasingly, in international trade and commerce, Canada's ability to attract world-class talent is helping Canada remain highly competitive. This is tied to our embrace of diversity.
Yes especially within regards to the issue at hand which is indigenous affairs.
It isn’t helpful to have a reserve and child welfare system mired in generational trauma, cultural assimilation, poverty and violence but you don’t seem to care about that. 
Supporting indigenous language  repairs communities and makes those communities cohesive. That is what would improve Canada. 
It does not improve Canada to mental block the idea of linguistic diversity in your head on some rigid view of sociology not based in history. It does not improve Canada to foster broken violent communities, so how do you see that addressed?
Obviously it’s more complicated then that but luckily your apathy isn’t exactly an authority so I think quite a few of these languages might do just fine
It’s really cool to be so unattached though, sort of zen vibes.
Well then elaborate about your anti language position I’m sure there’s a fantastical reason
Guess what China has been working hard on for the last 50 years?

The only reason this is being pushed is for social control and profit.  UBC which has a professor of real estate studies is utterly corrupt joke.  DO a little digging and you will find whoever did this study has deep ties to some spy agency and someone profiting off selling these.
metaverse, drugs and cryptocurrency is society's head in the sand reaction to ongoing pandemic(s) and catastrophic climate change

Your powers are extraordinary you managed to erase hundreds of studies to the contrary through sheer belief.
This is a world of global oligarchy and unfettered capitalism and you think there is a magic Mushrooms conspiracy by some magic mushrooms lobby? Because of 1 kooky article?
Drug use exist since forever in human history though... Not sure how you can compare it to crypto and MetaVerse... 
I don't really understand why crypto have anything to do with the pandemic either. 
As for the Metaverse, one could argue that the concept already existed for decades, long before Facebook. It's simply the next logical step in our social networking and internet.

.2 of some mid quality mushrooms. I don’t know about tolerance I’ve heard that throughout the years but don’t find a difference
>As for the Metaverse, one could argue that the concept already existed for decades, long before Facebook.
Decades? Even the Bible considers our physical existence a virtual reality and the spiritual afterlife to be the true reality. It's a very old idea.
"At present we are men looking at puzzling reflections in a mirror. The time will come when we shall see reality whole and face to face! At present all I know is a little fraction of the truth, but the time will come when I shall know it as fully as God now knows me!" 1st Corinthians 13:12 JBP

B.1.1.529 goes from zero to over 75% within those two weeks
in contrast, Delta took about 98 days (or 14 weeks) to go from zero to 75%; 22-Feb-2021 to 31-May-2021
B.1.1.529 is completely crushing Delta much much faster than Delta crushed the other variants.
there will just always be new variants every year forever.
zero covid is the only sane and rational policy.
You are incredibly naïve you think zero covid is attainable at this point.
>zero covid is the only sane and rational policy.
Our country is too weak, we lack the intestinal fortitude to achieve such a policy. The best we can hope for is reliable annual Covid shots, hopefully integrated with annual flu shots.
In the short-term, we may get lucky with B.1.1.529 if its current prevalence is just a sampling artifact and it isn't that competitive against delta. But we should be immediately restricting international travel until we know that for sure. We won't. But we should be.
oh I know its 100% not attainable by us, wonder what china will be able to do with the next couple of decades of zero covid and a bustling economy

Become totally isolationist. It won't work as well as you seem to imagine.
lmao theyre not becoming isolationist, theyre building the infrastructure to continue to aggressively pursue zero covid while keeping international trade and travel fully operational 
https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/29/china/guangzhou-covid-quarantine-center-mic-intl-hnk/index.html
You should live in China for at least a year. I can tell you haven't. I have.
China doesn't even have safe drinking water anywhere.
there is nowhere in all of china that has safe drinking water?
Yep. Basic infrastructure is extremely neglected in China. They spend money on projects to impress ignorant people like you. China is literally built on propaganda.
I’m vaccinated, everyone I socialize with is vaccinated. If I get it, so be it. I don’t care anymore. The vaccine should limit the symptoms and Covid is here to stay. I’m far from being complacent, I mask up, sanitize my hands, etc, but many people want some sense of normalcy.
They needed a poll for this?
I'm forced to sit 6 inches from coughing strangers on public transit yet they expect me to stand 6 feet from my family at Christmas? Get real. That's Zuckerberg levels of human behavior understanding.
Have y’all been to any public places recently? Like ROM or, especially, Ripley’s Aquarium here in Toronto? Hell, done any Costco shopping? 
No one is doing the social distancing anymore……
Y’all are still social distancing?
The other half are just lying or not going to parties.
Even wearing masks at this point is just theatre. It’s ridiculous that masks are mandatory at establishments that already require proof of vaccination. Everyone followed the rules, did everything that they were told, and still this charade continues. Even the way gyms regulate this is insane. Oh, you don’t have to wear a mask when using equipment, but as soon as you walk away from it, you gotta put it on. Didn’t know there was a small force field around this area where you can’t get it
My selfish comment. I’m fucking done with it. I’m going to wear my mask and do the best I can but everyone of my family members are vaccinated, and as long as they’re not experiencing symptoms I’m going to enjoy family time. I’m sure many people will say other wise and see family. We’ve done our part
It's a party, it ditches social distancing by default.  'Social Distancing' in a party context is called 'Not going to a party'.
This is up there with 'Most Canadians do not wear masks while eating.' or 'Delivery drivers refuse to work from home, why is that?'
For a split second I read that as, "Almost half of Canadians to ditch social media at holiday parties," and I thought, "That is a brilliant fucking idea.  Go Canada!"
Life's little disappointments...
It's not like I'm going to go a drunken ecstasy fueled orgy (although that does sound like a hell of a time) but I've adjusted my risk levels accordingly and I'm alright with hanging out with friends and family in closer spaces like homes and whatnot. I spent enough of my life being a hermit, COVID has shown that when you have no choice in the matter it fucking sucks and I'm looking to change that now.
I'm not a conspiracy theorist but I'm just tired of the charade now. How am I supposed to feel a sense of urgency when there are 15-20 people in the ICU. The public health emergency is our flimsy Healthcare system
I’m fully vaccinated. Everyone I know is fully vaccinated. Need proof of vaccination to go see a movie or fly somewhere or eat dinner in a restaurant? Sure, I’ll go along with that.
Here’s what I object to: in Alberta I can visit all of the above and much more as long as it’s in public. I can socialize with whomever I want in whatever numbers I want as long as it’s in a public place with a tonne of strangers.
What remains illegal is private gatherings in my home, even if 100% of the attendees are verifiably fully vaccinated. That is absurd.
Im starting to think polls are pointless
The Spanish flu never ended people just got used to it and moved on with life.
wait, they think people are social distancing at parties now?
Half of Canadians social distance at parties? Are they the same freaks walking around outside alone with masks on?
I ask again: what is the point of everybody being vaccinated if we don’t get to behave as though everybody is vaccinated?
At my work everybody is required to be vaccinated.  If you have the slightest of symptoms you are required to stay home.  And yet we are still required to wear masks.  What the fuck is going on anymore?  If we are going to have to wear masks forever now, just say it.  Otherwise, let’s all agree to move on.
Lol.  I haven't social distanced in my home ever.
Half? I thought more. At this point, any restriction is getting ridiculous. Most people are vaccinated. If the government really thinks we’re gonna continue this none-sense, they are detached from reality.
If we don't boycott the China olympics, we are a failed "western" nation.  What happened to "lest we forget"?  I guess we forgot.
If Trudeau wants to prove me wrong, great!  But I have no faith.
First, there are a lot of people being misled by all of this boycott talk. They are *not* discussing a true boycott, where we simply don’t go to the games. They are discussing a *diplomatic boycott*. The athletes would still attend. The only difference is that no major political figures or diplomats would attend. You know when the opening/closing ceremonies are happening and the camera pans around to all the world leaders in the audience? There would simply be no representative of the Canadian government present for that.
Second, it’s pathetic that this is basically amounting to “we want to boycott, but only if the United States joins us.” Absolutely pathetic. We are a sovereign nation that should be comfortable enough and confident enough in ourselves to stand up to bullies like China, that have been directly hostile to us, without needing another country to hold our hand or give us permission. It makes us look weak and completely undermines the message we’re trying to send.
Third, it’s even more pathetic that a full boycott *isn’t* on the table. This is obviously something that people may disagree with, since no one wants to see the lifelong dreams of our athletes crushed because of political reasons, but I just don’t have it in me to be okay with participating in a Chinese Olympic Games. Beijing wants these games to glorify and celebrate them as a nation, which is what the Olympics do for host countries. I have no interest in participating in such an event for an evil country like China.
Just lead the way and do it Canada
But we'll go to Qatar for the 2022 World Cup, where arenas are built by slave labour, because our team is red hot right now and this is our window to compete.
You know how we look back at the 1936 Olympics.....
then there was wars and shit .... 
and then we said never again.......
psst we are againing
just fucking do it already
Do it! The IOC is nothing more than an old boys club of money grubbing exploiters.
Part of me wants to see Canadian hockey team with Mcdavid on the team but another part of me says eff the ccp.
If Trudeau does this he will move up a notch in my books. That's Notch 1 of 10000, but its a vast improvement.
Lets have our own olympics, with hookers and blackjack, in fact to heck with the olympics.
I’m torn about a full boycott
On the one hand, China is evil and boycotting is the right thing to do
On the other, I desperately want to see team Canada run up the score 50-0 against China in hockey
A diplomatic boycott is all that is likely to happen and even then Canada will just follow and not lead.
Do it
With their aggressive belligerence and unwillingness to compromise with others there is going to be a nasty dust up with the Chinese at some point in the near future unless we stop appeasing them.  The Olympic boycott is one of the easiest opportunities we'll ever get to send a meaningful message.  It will cause some Chinese to question the party.   Even if it doesn't it will be noticed inside the party and drive the leaders to rethink future unilateral actions without consulting others.
I would love to see some Canadian Olympic hockey but more important to that would be standing up to China on the global stage.
The only thing I care about are the athletes that have trained for this all their lives, what do we do with them?
As much as it would feel good to boycott, the reasons they are holding out is because we are much more reliant on China than we'd like, and that can't change overnight. Hopefully the past two years will push us to get away from that, but it's not happening just yet.
For the previous major western boycott of the Moscow Olympics in 1980, that was a lot easier to do because we economically didn't really need anything from the Soviets. We operated in separate spheres.
For Nazi Germany, even if we did have the moral backbone to boycott, it would have been a similar situation.
With China though, we are heavily reliant on them for manufacturing. I'm not saying that's desirable, but it's an unavoidable fact. Extricating ourselves from that is a decades long project, as it took decades to get to that point in the first place.
So, if major Western nations boycott the Olympics, it will likely come with major economic repercussions that we didn't have to think about for 1980 in Moscow. Not saying it isn't worth it, but that's why Biden/Trudeau and others aren't making a snap judgment.
LETS GOOOOOO.
Boycott Beijing 2022, all in for that.
Not a chance in He'll would Skippy go against his heroes in the CCP! He wets the bed thinking about them!
This would be really good, China has gotten away with so much these last few years…
Boycott these Olympics. Many countries would follow. They probably won’t because of the good ole boy system. Just like the MLB cheating scandal. They had a chance a couple years ago to do what’s right a strip a championship away from Houston and possible end cheating but no. Roger Goodell and the Kapernick deal. He apologized to him. Completely pathetic. They need to be boycotted. Period.
> “Canadians need a *professional, ethical and experienced Conservative team* to hold this tired Liberal government to account and to provide Canadians with a clear alternative.”
Shame the CPC doesn’t have any of those qualities.
He's not wrong. I just don't believe he'd do any different.
CPC: puts their own anti vaxx needs before everyone
Also CPC: “wHaT aBoUt TrUdEaU?”
I mean he does have a point.
Don't most politicians put their own needs ahead of others?
Hmm. And the CPC putting its member's needs ahead of Canada's by fighting the parliamentary vaccine mandate.
And so does the Conservative party by not forcing it's MPs to get vaxxed...
He can’t even take care of the extremists anti vaxxing idiots in his party
Fuck outta here rotule
For a guy guy who can’t get his cronies immunized he sure talks a big game.
Pot meet kettle
Fortunately, some of Trudeau's needs actually align with most Canadian's. O'Toole and the CPC, not so much.
Says the man who puts the needs of his radical right over the needs of his own party and country.
I mean, he does have a hefty amount of lurid socks
Not always a bad thing though. Justin Trudeau's own need to get elected means that a morally bankrupt fucking loser like Erin O'Toole isn't currently the PM. So sometimes interests and needs align.

Trudeau couldn't hear him over the waves in Tofino
He's not wrong, but conservatives would just cut everything and let poor people suffer.
When will these people put forward policies rather than attacking the only person trying to do something for this country.

At this point I'm certain journalists masturbate while writing these articles
What to do?
Sack up and stop being fearful fools. Live your damn life as billions of our ancestors did throughout all human history when faced with an illness countless times worse than this pathetic excuse for a pandemic.

Surfs up brah!
At what wave will the media decide this is finally over? Everyone who wants a vaccine has one and most people are back to living their lives
I love how rather than walk, cycle, carpool with family, take her own car, etc, Dr Malgorzata gets into strangers cars then lectures them about Covid safety.
Imagine we're Hobbits.
Pretty cool? Maybe?
Is this the equivalent of second brunch?
I'm getting kinda full.
Every year the likelihood of having a wave of Covid is going to be 100% just like the flu, this is the stupidest observation I have ever seen. Well, one of them anyway.
Whatever you have to do to sell papers and ad space I suppose..
At this point, KCCO?
Get a booster shot
get vaccinated, get boosted when eligible, wear a mask, socially distance, limit contacts, live life. its not a big deal.

SA variant has Number shook, shit is gonna get real in short order.
Lol. Yeah I can certainly picture that
>Live your damn life as billions of our ancestors did throughout all human history when faced with an illness countless times worse than this pathetic excuse for a pandemic.
I mean, they died though. Maybe not the best example to follow.
I'm convinced there's *millions* of Canadians that would prefer if the COVID measures never ended - for them this will be the best year of their lives. 
For some - $2k/month - no questions asked. Others - no school for a year. Being able to work from home. Getting to spend uninterrupted time with their kids. Getting 6 months without mortgage payments. Business "loans". Staff salaries paid for. Etc. Etc. Etc. 
For everyone saying they're done with this I think there's just as many thatd be happy if things got worse.
I saw the table and men of all ethnicities are much more likely to be arrested than women of the same ethnicity. Clearly the police are also unfairly targeting men. Not that men commit more crimes… nope, can’t draw that conclusion
I’ll take predetermined outcomes for $200 Alex…
>“Taken together his report and our submissions confirm the existence of systemic racism and the impact of certain policing practices in British Columbia and demonstrate that its effects are pervasive and severe,” Govender said.
Hard to come to that conclusion without reading the 300 page report. What I want to know is if they took into account the general population around high crime areas. The reserve in my city has a ton of crime and gang activity, so I would assume that would raise the chances of a native person being arrested. 
I'm sure there are a lot of predominantly white neighborhoods that are also high crime areas as well, so it may be a moot point. But a Native person being 11 times more likely to be arrested is a pretty large discrepancy whether you think it's a predetermined outcome or not.
Are men arrested more than women?

We don't have enough housing, infrastructure, services to support existing Canadians.   [(NB wait list for a doctor is over 40,000.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/dorothy-shephard-health-care-doctor-nurse-practitioner-promise-wait-list-jeff-steeves-1.6202888)) 
 And our wages have been suppressed enough.
If we're actually concerned with climate change - we'll bring in millions who will increase their carbon footprint by relocating to Canada.  It'll serve to reduce our Canada 'per capita' numbers  but  will in actuality increase global emissions.  (And the Century Initiative wants Canada to bring in 100 Million - some of our politicians support that proposal.)
Can we not put on pause on immigration until we can take care of who's already here.
I wonder what the housing backlog looks like
There should be no immigration until we have full employment and affordable housing.
Wouldn't want wages to rise with inflation. That would cost rich people and their government cronies money.
That should solve the housing crisis…. Nothing like increasing demand in order to lower prices….
Jesus.  There are enough people here as it is
When do we just open the door and let them all in? You know that’s what the federal govt wants.
God no
Good Canada must take care of Canadian first
cool, where can i find a family doctor for me and my wife who were born here?
I could make short work of that.
Are we saying all those public servants working from home unsupervised may not be actually working?? LOL
[removed]
NS doctor waitlist just topped 81k. Atlantic Canada has been in the dumps for quite some time now
>Can we not put on pause on immigration until we can take care of who's already here.
No because apparentley every time some failed state's government is toppled, or a war breaks out in a country for the 11th time, that we're somehow obligated to bring them here. While neighboring countries that are actually responsible for the problems,  sit there and laugh
[removed]
Some of these immigrant no doubt will become doctors, nurses ect.  NB's population is aging and on the decline.
I don't think it's accurate to look at it as only more demand for services.  It's both, more demand and more supply.
What about under the family class? Such as reuniting spouses, etc? 
I only ask out of genuine curiosity. I see the dangers of too much immigration but am patiently waiting for my spouse to be granted permanent residency and my life would be significantly altered if they weren’t able to work in Canada.
Roxham Road calling in...
In 2020 we had 350,000 immigrants, in a year when the vast majority of citizens could not leave or reenter the country. It's pretty open already.
I thought this is what people wanted, pipes getting shut in? Now let’s just get line 5 done as well and live a glorious fossil fuel free lifestyle. /s
There ya go. No pipeline, No crude, No gas.
How are all those tree huggers going to get to their latest protest now? Walk??  LOL
Environmentalists must be thrilled! They've been calling for things like this for ages
The hardships just keep coming for B.C.
I'm actually impressed that the gas price hasn't changed since the storm, it's still around $1.60 a litre where I live. The gas company's must know they are under a microscope right now and decided not to gouge customers.
way ahead of you friend.
ioniq 5 coming to canada soon! looks hot
[https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/hyundai/ioniq-5](https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/hyundai/ioniq-5)
get your pre orders in asap!
Now they don't have to bomb it!
I won't gloat publicly but I am feeling smug as a bug in a rug
Should have diversified
Government already put in place measures that restrict profits from gasoline to not be above avg for prior 90 days or something like that, so prices will stay fairly steady.
Just wait… it’s coming.
Awesome! I’m sure we’ll get the 24m other passenger cars and our entire freight and airplane fleet converted in a jiffy.
I’m sorry but I love this.
The problem isn't profits though.
Sourcing oil for the refinery is obviously be more expensive, and if it costs the refinery 10c/L more to source the oil, gas prices will go up by 10c/L.
Thanks for that, I must have missed that announcement.
I wonder how that effects the commodities futures market for oil in Canada.
Plus mining equipment and shipping boats. Convert all farm machines, trains and plastics production before 2025
If you can think of a way to convert a fleet over other than one car at a time - let me know.
whether its an inch, or a foot, don't sneeze at progress.
/me pops more popcorn. This season of "hippies vs society" is shaping up to be interesting.
all those lower mainland mines and plastics manufacturers 
electric farm equipment sounds dope. is there a spac I can toss money at?
thanks.. I needed something to put me to sleep!
>“It all comes back to one thing,” says Darryl Wilton, president of the Ontario Paramedic Association, “and that’s a bed shortage.” People stay in hospitals longer than necessary because other options — such as long-term care — aren’t available, he explains.
There's a number of problems. One is the beds in hospital but there are many other issues.
Take for one, the overuse of 911 and hospitals. The vast majority of patients seen in hospital and by paramedics are CTAS 3, 4 and 5 patients which can be handled by the family doctor, a walk in clinic or an urgent care clinic. Due to liability issues, neither the paramedics nor the hospital are allowed to tell the patient that they should go that route though. Hell, paramedics are taught that even if someone calls for a stubbed toe and doesn't want to go to hospital that we should tell them "you could die if you don't go to the hospital"!
This is further compounded by covid and the fact that many primary care physicians and pediatricians are either inaccessible or are telling patients to go to hospital for problems they can deal with (and then charging OHIP for the consult)
We have a system that's been held together with bubblegum and tape for years and its finally crashing down
400,000 immigrants very year should remedy this issue /s

Something tells me this isn't a complete story here. _perhaps_ its my white male privilege talking here, but _generally_ our hospitals don't just slap you awake after surgery and kick you out in the middle of the night unless there's something else going on here that this story isn't mentioning.
>"I was stunned.... The hospital was trying to discharge me in the middle of the night in near-freezing weather, without a coat, identification, phone, vehicle or money, over an hour's drive from my home in another city while I was weak and exhausted," George wrote.
This isn't systemic racism... this is just how shit our hospital systems are. They do the same thing to 90 year old ladies.
Hospitals are not hotels.
Sounds like she was treated like anyone else would have been.
Do I want to know what "two spirit" means?
People like this are exhausting for staff to care for. I'm sure the nurses and aids were begging the doctor to discharge this woman lmao.
I'm sure the Hurt Feelings Commission will come up with an accurate take on this.
/s
The real story here is why the mainstream news gives people like this any attention
The second photo in the article says it all- she’s a full blown Karen with that haircut.
Big yikes
After skimming the article it looks like the hospital is completely in the right
There would appear to be some logical gaps
CBC doesn’t care, it ticks the boxes and furthers the narrative, and the hospital can’t say anything without breaking confidentiality. 
There is definitely more to this story.
George is also seeking $175,000 in damages. She is accepting donations to help pay for the legal costs of the human rights claim...
That's why the story is full of gaps. Have to get this tried in the court of public opinion first.
It's in the article, that their father took their belongings.
Your designated family member took your stuff and left. That's is not the hospital's problem.
Why didn't the father stick around?
That’s the problem.
You’ll feel dumber for knowing.
Its the gender that only natives can be
2S = FN's LGBTQIA+
No.

Mother Nature has it in for Canada right now….
Hey Newfoundland,  I know this sucks, and stuff is going to be messed up for a bit, but you guys are going to be ok. 
-a BC resident
seems that way.. Im now wondering what she has in store for the prairies. Maybe a 100+ cm snow storm
Maybe it's time for Canada to modernize it's crumbling infrastructure. Severe weather can damage a modern highway, but as we're seeing it'll destroy a 60 year old highway that was shit to begin with. I drive in Canada, I drive in the US and I drive in Mexico. Canadian roads are a lot closer to what's in Mexico minus the topes. 
Oh, and the coquihalla is not a modern highway, who builds a freeway with 8% grades? Only in fucking BC
I'll take my downvotes now
It does suck, but we are pretty used to this. 
That region frequently sees winds in the 130-150km/hr range (it's called Wreckhouse, after all) and we are no strangers to excessive rain causing road and highway wash outs.
Give them a few days and they'll have makeshift roads built around the washed out stretches. I just feel bad for people with basement flooding at this point.
>Maybe a 100+ cm snow storm
Yeah, if we could get some of that in Halifax, that'd be great. I love big blizzards, been a while since I've experienced one.
Already been in drought all summer and it doesn't seem to be letting up.
Well, yes, we're obviously going to have to adapt our infrastructure for climate change, even if we hadn't been deferring necessary repairs and maintenance. These sorts of weather events are only going to increase in frequency and intensity.
Yes infrastructure in preparation for climate change is nice but have you considered spending 77.3 billion dollars on warships instead? I hear boats are handy for floods and this is definitely a boat.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Surface_Combatant
I do hope we'll get enough snow this year. The water was really low in the streams, rivers and lakes this year.
I don't disagree with you, but this goes way back. In the 80's and 90's we were talking about how we were outgrowing our transportation systems. Alberta at least spent some money and has a better highway system than BC, Ontario and Quebec, but it's still not even close to the standard you'd see in the US or Germany. And the small population provinces are almost a write off.
De jure sovereignty refers to the legal right to do so; de facto sovereignty refers to the factual ability to do so.
We have de jure sovereignty in the Arctic, but no de facto sovereignty. We’ll lose the Arctic archipelago’s passages to the rest of the world as international straits if and when the ice becomes navigable for commerce, unless we set the precedent and actually gain the ability to exert force in the region.
I’m no proponent for this as I hate climate change and imposing on areas dear to indigenous peoples, but it’s the reality of what will happen and why these ships have been ordered. The rest of the Canadian navy is old afff, we don’t even have usable submarines.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMCS_Harry_DeWolf
Seems I mixed that ship up with this one, but my point still stands for funding these ships.
Also, infrastructure isn’t just a federal responsibility. The funding of our countries infrastructure is spread out through the budget of the municipal, provincial, and federal systems we have
We really need both ideally
>Critics of the tie-up between cable giants Rogers Communications Inc. and Shaw Communications Inc. say the deal puts significant funding for Global News at risk and could harm viewers in Western Canada, where the station is popular, and hurt independent broadcasters in smaller markets.
>Rogers, which is seeking approval of the transaction from the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and other government bodies, has said it plans to redirect funding that Calgary-based Shaw currently provides to Global — about $13 million in 2020 — to its own broadcaster, Citytv.
>It’s a tiny slice of the $26-billion deal, but a big chunk of Global News’s annual budget of about $138 million in 2020, and some intervenors at this week’s CRTC hearing on the merger say Rogers should be held to account for the negative consequences of more consolidation in the communications industry.
>The fallout could include a worse product for viewers plus Global News turning to other funding sources and receiving a portion of money that would otherwise go to local news producers in smaller cities that aren’t affiliated with the three major English-language private networks (Bell’s CTV is the third).
>“Aside from this merger, we wouldn’t be discussing this. It’s only (this) merger that leaves Global seeking funding through some other source,” Lecia Simpson, director of broadcasting policy and regulatory affairs at Telus Corp., told the CRTC on Tuesday. “I think it’s incumbent on (Rogers) to first acknowledge, but then address the harms that flow from this merger.”
>Vancouver-based Telus is one of Canada’s big three national wireless carriers and sells television service to customers in B.C. and Alberta and parts of Quebec, but it does not have a media division. It argued on Tuesday that the commission should reject the transfer of broadcast licences from Shaw to Rogers for numerous reasons, primarily because it would give the combined company too much power in the Canadian broadcast sector.
>On the issue of local news, Simpson and other Telus executives said if the commission does approve the transfer of licences, it should require Rogers to continue funding Global News.
>“Global News is a service that many Western Canadians rely on,” said Zainul Mawji, executive vice-president of home solutions at Telus, adding that Global attracts more than 20 per cent of viewers to its evening newscasts in B.C. and Alberta, compared to just over one per cent for Citytv stations.
>Simpson said Global is likely to turn to the Independent Local News Fund (ILNF) for support and noted that the $13 million would chew up more than half of the fund’s roughly $21 million budget in 2019-2020.
>“(Rogers’s) entire proposal relies on externalizing (those costs) to the detriment of truly independent local news production,” she said.
>On Monday, Rogers broadcast vice-president Susan Wheeler told the CRTC the company found it hard to “get our head around” the idea of continuing to fund a rival network.
>Wheeler said that at about $27 million, Citytv’s annual budget is much smaller than Global’s and redirecting the money will help City compete for more viewers in the West.
>To boost Canadian content, the CRTC requires cable providers to contribute to the broadcast system. Under a 2016 policy for “vertically integrated” players (businesses that create television content and also distribute it to home TV subscribers), the CRTC has allowed cable companies to direct some of that funding to local news programming.
>Global is owned by Corus Entertainment Inc., which is ultimately controlled by the Shaw family who also control the Shaw Communications telecom business. After a spinoff of the media division and subsequent sale of shares in recent years, Corus is not owned by the cable company, but because of the family’s ownership ties, the CRTC still considers the companies to be related.
>Since 2016, Shaw has directed local news funding to Global News while Rogers has funded Citytv (Bell has funded CTV).
>Corus said in a September filing with the CRTC that it was concerned the loss of funding “will have a detrimental impact on local news production and delivery, including in markets such as Kelowna, Lethbridge, Saskatoon, Regina, Peterborough, Kingston, Saint John and Halifax, where Corus operates local stations but Rogers does not.”
>But Corus is not scheduled to appear in person at the five-day CRTC hearing and a spokesperson declined to comment further on the matter Tuesday.
>Dwayne Winseck, professor at Carleton University’s School of Journalism and Communication and director of the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project, has been studying the effects of consolidation in the Canadian media and telecom industries over the past two decades.
>“When you see ownership transactions, you typically see the diversion of resources away from the creation of original content, especially expensive content like news that doesn’t have big profit margins,” Winseck said, adding that the newly combined companies often prioritize other spending, “especially paying down the debt of these mergers.”
To them that's pennies. Their annual revenue is $324 Million / Year
Oh no! They’ll just have to “pull themselves up by their bootstraps and sToP eAtInG aVaCaDo tOaSt”.
Free market
Oh no! Anyways...
Do people actually watch TV these days?
Hunh? It literally says their budget is 138m a year so actually it is a decent cut to the budget when costs have also gone up.
Its ~10% of their budget which is somewhat significant
Yes.
The only thing I watch on Global is the news.
do they still autoswitch all Simpson's feeds to the global channel one when it's on?
About the only time I tune into the news is on election nights. I don't even have cable, or a TV for that matter, unless you count my laptop and tablet.
No idea, haven't watched that show in years.
I just use the free app. I'm even contemplating cancelling Netflix, I might watch an hour or so of YouTube but that's it.
Priorities. Theirs are fucked.
Even from a purely political perspective, what are they thinking? Only 10% of the population agrees with this. The Conservative party needs to boot out all the antivaxxers if it wants to ever have a chance at government again.
Well, this is dumb.
Rules for thee and not for me.
I'm just so confused by their strategy here. Are they trying to make it so Trudeau wins a fourth term?  Do O'Toole and Singh have some kind of bet on who can help him the most?
FFS O'Toole. Get with the program.
Every time you open your mouth about vaccination, you shove another foot int it.
You are the leader, don't let those few unvaccinated MP's wag their tail.
Political hypocrisy as usually.
Really working on the pressing issues of the people...
Wether you are for or against this decision by O'Toole, we can all agree that in the picture, he looks like he is about to shit/just has shat his pants.
Nice of the CPC to come out fully as anti-vaxxers, not like we didn't already know this.
They will fight for their right to not take the jab, but when it comes to everyone else, not one word of support
As a bible thumping - card carrying conservative, fuck the conservative party of canada, specifically Erin O'Toole
>Even from a purely political perspective, what are they thinking?
They're thinking that allowing this to stand puts them at the mercy of the Liberal-controlled Board of Internal Economy. The power the Board purported to exercise is one reserved for the House as a whole, and the fact that the Liberals have a majority on the Board, and minority in the House, casts the importance of that distinction into sharp relief.
This isn't about vaccines, it's about power, governance, and mission-creep.
I got vaccinated but oppose mandates.  More than 10% agrees.
Rules in the House are governed primarily by convention and precedent rather than law. The authority to bar an MP from the House rests with the House as a whole, which is currently controlled by the opposition, not the Board of Internal Economy, which is controlled by a Liberal majority. Allowing the precedent to stand that the Board of Internal Economy can make rules like this, *particularly in a minority government*, risks subordination of the authority of the House to the Government even further than has already occurred.
This is a serious governance issue, not a vaccination issue.
this is exactly what I dont understand. I could not be farther from you politically but we're both very unhappy with their stance. Who the fuck are they trying to appeal to?
If this is actually what they are thinking they should have the decency to explain this to the Canadian people instead of waging an ignorant anti-vaxx propaganda campaign.
The only thing MP’s can’t do over zoom is heckle and interrupt, which is against the standing orders anyways.
The other parties all support the mandate though, so wouldn't it pass regardless.
Themselves.  Like they always do.
I honestly don’t think they know any more.  All they care about is expanding the tent to include as many single-issue voters as they can.  At some point that tent will collapse.
They did. From the article:
>"This question of privilege doesn't relate in any way to disputing vaccines, or their very vital role in conquering the COVID 19 pandemic… **What I'm questioning here is the jurisdiction of the board to be able to make that decision,” Richards said in the House of Commons, going on to cite sections of the parliamentary rulebooks in making his case.**
>At issue for the Conservatives is the “improper conduct and precedent set” by the Board of Internal Economy (BOIE) in deciding to implement the mandate ahead of Parliament’s return, during a closed-door meeting. The board is a long-standing cross-party committee of nine MPs in House leadership roles, including Conservatives.
>**“I believe that the Board of Internal Economy decision represents a major breach of the ancient privileges of this House, and in fact could set a very troublesome precedent,”**
And that's been their position from the beginning. In [this](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/o-toole-says-caucus-will-both-respect-and-challenge-house-vaccine-policy-1.5640593) October 27th article for example, while noting that Conservatives will respect the order, O'Toole indicates expressly that:
>"A question of privilege will be raised in the House of Commons **to challenge the improper conduct and precedent set,” O’Toole said. “Only the House of Commons itself can determine its composition and its conduct."**
The issue here is not that the Conservatives have not explained why they're challenging this.

At  the  same  time  they  enjoy  a  level  of  political freedom,  such  that  this  combination  may  result  in  undue  reliance/trust  being  placed  by  the  public on  information  provided  by  RCs/NPOs.  **The  subject  of  false  and  misleading  information  was  part of  the  mandate  of  this  Inquiry.  As  noted  in  Part  VI  of  the  report,  RCs/NPOs  often  express  an extreme  or  urgent  view to  make  their  point,  which  often  does  not  present  a  full  and  complete picture  in  a  balanced  manner.**  As  also  noted  above,  Edelman  has  declared  that  Information Bankruptcy  has  occurred  in  Canada,  which  should  be  a  serious  concern  for  all  institutions  and  all Canadians.
One can mislead without doing anything illegal. We need to stop acting as though the expected standard of behaviour is mere compliance with the law.
If they could sue him they would have. Just empty threats.
shouldnt be a threat.  skip the warning and do it.
Good Luck with that.  His speech is protected.
Why to leading conservatives always look like they're worried they're about to shit their pants?
The amount of twisting you think it requires depends upon what Kenney said.
they removed conservative funding data.
Yeah, that's fair. The article presents it in general terms, but the specifics could absolutely make a difference.
What I felt. The report is pretty vague and general, which would probably be good for Kenney if he was equally vague and general, I think.

He plead guilty without trial, against legal advice. He accepted a heavy-handed sentence for what was an unfortunate accident, not a malicious act. And he has carried the guilt of his actions each and every day.
He **could have** plead not guilty. He **could have** gotten a good lawyer who saw to it he got nothing more than probation. He **could have** done everything to save his own skin. He didn't.
He took full responsibility. He is exactly the sort of person I want in Canada and to call a Canadian.
The accident was the result of a mistake, not malice.  The perpetrator has shown consistent, genuine remorse for what has happened.  He's taken responsibility, acknowledged the consequences, and apologized to the people whose lives were affected.
We need more people in Canada who respond that way when they make a mistake instead of relentless trying to duck responsibility and shift blame.  I would support allowing him to remain in Canada once he has served his sentence.  I would also support a reduced sentence if he behaves appropriately in prison.  He's already suffered a great deal.
Justice is about balance, not revenge.
Interesting that you can kill someone with your vehicle while having been caught driving drunk years earlier but still get off with nothing and eventually become the Preimier of Saskatchewan.
But someone else can have a complete accident while under no influence, express regret, serve their sentence, and people are still hounding this guy. He made a grave mistake, but leave the guy alone at this point. He took responsibility and didn't try to game the legal system like 95% of criminals by automatically claiming no guilt.
Before the accident, the man was a productive member of society who held a job and was trying to build a life with his wife.
He was put into an unbelievably difficult position, given completely inadequate training and then just set loose onto the highway. Despite this, he took responsibility for the accident, elocuted his guilt and is serving a rather harsh sentence. 
Let him stay and try and build that life he and his wife were hoping for.
True story: my friends sister is a cop and mainly works undercover. They tailed him consistently after the accident (possibly in case he flees?) and she said he went to temple *every day*. 
As others have mentioned he plead guilty and took full responsibility for this tragic accident. I hope he can stay in Canada. 
That said, I can’t say how I’d feel if my child was one of the kids on that bus. Oof.
Pretty unfortunate situation. As a low to no risk to reoffend, Im not sure deportation is reasonable in this situation. As much as I feel for those families that want him deported, they are doing so out of a lust for vengeance, not justice. Also, there are families that have no issue with him staying. I think he should stay.
I personally knew many of those on the bus, and one was a colleague of mine. 
I have long said, the actions of this man are those of someone who truly does regret how his action lead to their deaths. Deporting him doesn't bring anyone back. 
I believe he should be allowed to stay in Canada.
I thought the whole point of our justice system was once you were out justice had been done. But by some of the comments here you would think there's no interest in justice just vengeance.
Let him. It was an honest mistake with horrible consequences. Accidents happen.
Corrupt trucking companies and government ministers (responsible for deficient regulations) are the real criminals here.
I dont know of its his case but Truck divers are overworked. I dont get why this is not one of the main subject. People work way over the 16 hours max to try to make their job worth it. The Pakistanese, Indian and Sri Lankan i meet at my job work for pennies and get pushed to drive over their 16 hours. This is not healthy or safe at all.
This guy is serving more time then drunk drivers. He didn't actively do anything malicious that day, it was an accident. A deadly, very very tragic accident. He admitted his mistake outright. His employer and many others should be the ones booted who don't feel Canadian laws and regulations apply to them.
I feel the driver represents Canadian values better than a lot of people in this thread.
After watching his interview on [W5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1GmNkqGSt0) ..... I can't help but feel bad for him and his fiance. This ordeal has affected everyone. He has shown remorse and is a model citizen. He didn't run away and accepted full responsibility for this. He deserves to stay in Canada.
This guy should absolutely be allowed to stay. Remember everyone, Adesh Deol trucking forced this guy into a difficult unfamiliar route with no training and wished him good luck. The owner had a new company set up and recruiting new untrained and underpaid drivers before the boys were even fucking identified. 
That PoS deserves most of the blame. Every canadian who pushed against additional trucking industry regulation also owns some blame. Were at the point we don't even need to write new songs about our tragedies, they just keep happening.  I home Tom Cochrane is still around to play us the 3rd/4th version of Big League the next time, maybe then we will change some laws and hold the right people accountable.
I felt the 8 years was a bit too much and so did many of the parents of the dead teenagers. He shouldn't be deported.
We should have blamed the dangerous and broken system of truck driver certification and training for this catastrophe, instead we made Sidhu the scapegoat. He made a relatively simple mistake that due to bad luck had horrific consequences. There is no justifiable reason to deport him because there was no intent in the crime he committed. However; him staying in Canada would like be a net negative for himself and the families. He shouldn’t have been handed an eight year prison sentence when he doesn’t need to be rehabilitated.
I think most would agree to allow him to stay.
This man accepted his guilt.  He is openly and humbly remorseful.  This is a tragedy for sure, but deportation is not going to change the outcome.
I think a problem here is because he stepped up and took resonsibility and all the blame.   The other actors involved are avoiding the scrutiny they deserve.  For example the trucking business he worked for, the trucking industry that set the standards, the licensing that licensed him with so little training, experience and supervision and also road design are all partially at fault.  If not completely at fault.  
I grew up in similar flat area of the country and those 2 way stops killed many people when I was growing up, it's easy to miss signs on those big wide open roads for some reason. Road design can certainly help, for example make it a 4 way stop instead of 2 way, so even if one person blows through there's a chance the other would be stopped.  Or install rumble strips in all directions, so if signs are missed there is a tactile and audible indicator.    Human error will always occur so not saying these changes would 100% stop this in the future, but I think this one man taking all the blame is protecting these others from the scrutiny that they should get.  Even if incremental changes could come from it.
while ignoring the elephant in the room of having to compete to get the materials to process...
so as no expertise exist in Canada for over a decade; that's more foreign worker programs.
They think if they keep saying they will do it, that they never have to do it.

Those with no debt, dependable employment and high earnings will be alright.
It's almost like Canada voted for this.
Oh well.
dammit how did it come to this
Ahhh just raise it to 5% and just watch those foreclosures roll in
I look around my neighbourhood and everyone has two new cars.  To me that's an issue.  Everyone at work eats out, or buys coffee everyday, that's an issue.  People need to do a rethink of their lifestyles, and live within their means.  Not being an asshole, just being practical.  I do it, still do fun things and enjoy myself, just am a little thrifty.
Inflation hitting multi-decade highs and the BoC is worried about investors and speculators? What is their mandate again?
Ain’t shit gonna happen.  Mark my words.
Mark Carney is the smartest Canadian of all as he chose to avoid the stain of this whole debacle.
Central banking was a mistake
They will eventually do it, and will destroy a bunch of 🇨🇦’s economically. Especially those they claim to fight for. The damage is already done though and will take decades to fix. The politicians won’t feel a thing.
Hey BOC, you created this mess.
Rates can't and won't rise by any meaningful amount. The populace and the government is in too much debt. Rising rates will make paying debt off more expensive, and the BoC knows this.
Interest rates will likely settle around 2% by end of 2023 when all is said and done.
Oh well
Rise by what? 0.25% Won't do anything. Increase to 5%+ then let the games begin.
Consumers calling their bluff
So much for my cheap variable mortgage.
Lol.  Everyone missing the point.  $20 a day for lunch/coffee = $6700 a year.  Sorry, but that's a lot of money.  If you don't think it is, maybe that's the problem.
No. Fucking. Shit.

It's not happening
> “If you only have 148 tanks and 22 of them are stuck in Canada, that’s 22 tanks that are not at readiness and not available to do anything operational,” a defence source told The Telegraph.
These tanks sure look old.
>“If you only have 148 tanks and 22 of them are stuck in Canada, that’s 22 tanks that are not at readiness and not available to do anything operational,” a defence source told The Telegraph.
Wow.  As an island, I realize that Britain has no native reason to a power in land-based defence, but that is still exceptionally small for an country that is considered a major military power.
If the British only have 148 tanks, that’s laughable! (Canada is likely even lower). To put this into perspective, Poland has at least 250 Leopard tanks and has ordered another 250 Abrams tanks because of the Russian threat.
Jesus. Sounds like a world war is an inevitability.
[deleted]
I think they're [Warrior APCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrior_tracked_armoured_vehicle), with just a 30mm cannon.
They are old.
People generally associate the new cutting edge stuff that you see on TV as what the military operates.
Every militaries bulk kit, especially vehichles, are generally old chassis that have upgraded guts.
The Warrior pictured in the article traces its lineage back to the early 70's. 
Our brand new LAV6's draw lineage from the early 90's in concept and are basically a direct upgrade of our LAV3's which entered service 22 years ago.
Vehichles in particular progress quickly on the inside but slowly on the outside. Only when the threat changes drastically(IED's in the Middle East) do you see the outsides start changing rapidly
The UK is actually considering getting rid of tanks all together, they think that as drones develop tanks are becoming semi-redundant. The recent Armenia and Azerbaijan war has only reinforced this belief.
I mean having a large land army isn’t really in the UKs doctrine. They’ve always been a naval power. Compare the Polish fleet to the RN maybe?
Edit: I just realized this is the CAF sub troll. We fell for it
If Canada or Britain find themselves deploying tanks it will be in someone else's land war, if Poland deploys tanks it will be in their land war.
Makes sense they would have more then a few. makes sense we would focus on other things.
Now compare the RAF to the Polish Air Force….
Poland has a land border with a Russian client state (Belarus).
The UK has a giant moat, protected by first rate Navy and Air force, surrounded by friendly countries that also have first rate air forces..
[deleted]
Right? How is the UK supposed to defend its borders with so few tanks?
> Poland has at least 250 Leopard tanks and has ordered another 250 Abrams tanks because of the Russian threat.
They also have more than 600 T-72's or T-72 derivatives/upgrades.
Tanks are largely becoming obsolete. 
Recent war zones with lots of tanks involved like Ukraine and Armenia,  most tanks are killed by dudes with AT missiles like the javelin, spike and Kornet.. or destroyed by drones . Whether they are suicide drones like the TB2 or ones that shoot their own missiles. 
Point being. These weapons are considerably quicker to make. Often cheaper. And easier to move around rather than maintaining a huge motor pool of armor. 
Russia has tens of thousands of tanks and afvs (majority of which are obsolete) because their ground forces still operate on red army doctrine.
If Russia is a threat, it's only because the West uselessly antagonizes her and folishly guarantees the independence of countries that are outside our sphere of influence. The real threat is China and we are pushing our Russian brothers in China's arms instead of making them allies.
well Russia is pretty loudly advertising it's intention to invading Ukraine again. oh, and the US is looking as a new weapon to replace the M16, they need something more suited to shooting at soldiers wearing modern body armor... for some reason.
Thanks!
I mean we’re already at like 145/L lol
Biden us trying to make it look like he is doing something, the 8m m3 he released would last the U.S. about 4 days.
Not defending carbon tax, but a quick scroll shows no one ripping oil companies, provincial tax, federal tax, or, more importantly,  speculators.
You haven't seen anything yet, this is just the start.
What did everyone think was going to happen when they opposed shale gas production and pipelines, and asked for carbon taxes?
Good thing we prepared for this by having **zero** domestic battery, electric vehicle, wind, solar power, and nuclear reactor industry (other than assembling parts imported from overseas).
Like tapping your family's emergency fund for xmas.
The prices will go up in Canada to balance the lost revenue in the States. It's the way of Global Competition.
I can’t wait until the border opens up on the 30th. Biweekly gas and grocery trips across the river.
I think the safest conclusion to make is that the consumer has no control over market forces. Any information that comes out is either incorrect or misleading. We’ll never know the true scope of what causes our fuel prices. 
It’s just easier to assume everything is profit driven and move on.
$1.26 as of yesterday 
Costco Winnipeg
Yes. We are going to see high oil prices in the long term now for sure.
NS's will because it is set weekly from the NY spot price on Wednesday.
 https://nsuarb.novascotia.ca/mandates/gasoline-diesel-pricing/gasoline-prices-zone-map#/zone_4
Anything that shakes the tree is an excuse to raise prices.
Apparently he's sending a bunch of this oil to China, soooo probably?
Liberal voters don't get the right to complain about gasoline prices when they are enabling the legislated annual increases to fuel in this country ie the carbon tax. We could shave off 9 cents per litre right now by not having the carbon tax. If you think it's bad now, just wait until the carbon tax is 37.5c/litre in 2030.
That’s rookie numbers compared to some parts of the country.
Just wait till the carbon tax hits 39 cents a liter.  You have’t see anything seen anything yet.
What you think he’s got enough oil to last us for weeks and that instead of saving it for something more catastrophic he should release it so gas prices go down for a bit longer, yet still temporarily?
Ya except you have no idea what you’re talking about… it’s not like they are releasing what they are and not taking any more in… they’re bringing in what they normally do plus releasing that.
I even heard it's about 2.5 worth of fuel yesterday at the radio
No.
This is FUD and you are spreading Bullshit.
Opposing a pipeline that hasn’t been built is not the reason for high prices.
Stop spreading bullshit of Big Oil.
We have supply / demand issue.
One of largest users , airlines , have not had demand for two years. Start with that.
the dirty secret of the industry is that many retailers are using the ruse and daily onslaught of inflation story to flat out raise prices
I went to Loblaws tonight and noticed multiple items cost more.  Kcups, diapers, breakfast sausages all up 20% at least.
I’d been noticing a lot of Shrinkflation for the last year but tonight is the first time I saw straight up price increases across the board in multiple categories.   
I think they must have repriced multiple items in the last 2 weeks.
Has anyone else noticed that quality seems to have gone way down too? All of the produce in the big box grocery stores looks wilted and sad.
Maybe before they raise all the prices they could consider taking a tiny hit to their massive profits, to....you know....help the common person.
They should try price-fixing bread again. That went over really well last time.
https://www.strosbergco.com/class-actions/bread/
No shit sherlock. You don't need to have Loblaws tell you this.. just try and buy anything from anywhere and you'll hear all about it from the people that work there. 
Hell I was at Leon's the other day for their big sale... Everything I pointed to they didn't have stock on for weeks. So I say to the lady what do you have stock on and she points at two ugly-ass blue couches. Literally that's all they had stock on for immediate sale were two deep blue couches. It took me 6 hours of furniture shopping to find a couch that was in stock that I actually liked. 
I work in trade wholesale. We're seeing shortages everywhere, material costs are skyrocketing, production is way down and many stock items are becoming rare. I don't think we're going to come out of this for a few more months yet...
Grocery stores made unprecedented gains in 2020 due to lockdowns and staycations. Aside from greed, there is no reason for them to react any differently than they did when they raked in record profits. 
They sure didn’t lower their prices last year when things were good.
Yet their profits have never been higher 🤔. Work from home and inflation means less people can afford to eat out which will benefit grocers. I don’t get it.
Because long supply chains were going to make everything cheaper. /s.
Loblaws' earnings are surely very impacted and will not be at record levels. The Weston family would never profit off of the suffering of Canadians! /s
Well making record  profits .
Lower your fuckinv prices ..
Galen Weston wants you to all the way down to the balls and choke on it.
Inflation goes up but not their "hero" wages? How odd..
What about greed?
No fucking shit.  Why waste time writing and posting this?
Inflation and supply chain issues? But, O’toole said it was all the Trudeau Liberals’ fault!
The government's actions over the last 2 years have been very destructive to supply chains. Then backlogs that never catch up and toss in a few natural disasters.
To me it's blatantly obvious. In this article, prices are up, labour costs are up, but oh... Look.... Profits are also up 20% too. 
Fuck Loblaws
This.
Big box retailers aren't being affected by inflation; they're price gouging.
I agree! Every time I see a news story telling us to expect prices to rise, that there are supply chain issues,  that inflation is on the rise.....all I can see is retail giant CEO's rubbing their hands together in glee
I mean, they don't answer questions when it is in person anyway. Nobody does. Every Canadian politician has maxed out agility and can deflect all of the question arrows.
"Allowing the government to dodge scrutiny" is an odd way of saying you can't shout across the aisle and interrupt speakers over a zoom call.
So get vaxxed and show up morons.
No surprise that uselesspoliticalhack has continued his trend of posting useless political articles that he thinks invokes sympathy for his Useless Political Masters, lol
I mean the Liberals don't answer questions when the whole parliament is in person anyway
there is no reason for virtual commons. we have 15 - 20 000 people in the ACC every other night.
They're upset that they can't heckle and shout like petulant teenagers
If a venue bans entry to people wearing T-shirts saying "I am a dumbass", do you blame the venue for not being able to enter, or do you blame yourself for advertising that you are a dumbass?
It's clear which position the Conservative Party has taken. 
Dumbasses.
I started watching those question periods that were being uploaded you YouTube a while back. Quit 2 videos in. That shit is enraging. Same question gets asked 4 different ways and the non-answer only changes by a few words. Every time I watched it was the same. Waste of taxpayer dollars hardly at work.
They have no ammo against the PM, so they choose these little trivial things and throw tantrums like teenage drama queens. And their moronic supporters eat it up because they’re too fucking stupid to think otherwise.
Neither did the CPC before they, nor the Liberals before them, nor the PC’s before them.  As many political commentators have put it, “It’s called Question Period, not Answer Period”.  It has always been political theatre used to try to create perfect soundbites for the 6pm news.  MP’s that have serious questions submit written questions which are researched by the appropriate department and usually much more fully answered.
May be a bad sign when we have better vaccination acceptance among hockey fans than among members of parliament.
there is a reason though: everyone inside the ACC was willing to provide proof of vaccination
Most of those fans don’t have to take weekly flights to go to the game.  Cutting down on travel is a good thing both epidemiologically as well as financially (I guess Conservatives aren’t that worried about cutting spending)
Doesn't make it a good position to hold, just one that is held by many people.
There is not always strength in numbers
But what's ~~her~~ their position on the geopolitical situation in the mid-east?
There's still a green party?
"I was away at boarding school in California at the time...."
JFC what a way to start.
New *interim* Green Party Leader
She has a really tough job ahead of her. The party is pretty much in shambles.
I hope she succeeds in a new role.
Unfortunately her first battle is against the English language. Good luck with that.
>What had caused the mudslide was a bit complicated. There was an illegal pond, I believe, installed at the property above, and fill had been added, which exacerbated the mudslide risk. But there was actually a known risk of mudslides for that slope, and technically … there shouldn't have been a development there in the first place. 
TIL that climate change causes installation of ponds, and that unstable slopes never existed before mankind started pumping CO2 into the atmosphere.
Im sure many party insiders will be more interested in that. Will she call Israel an "apartheid state"?
Dr Kutner uses they/them/their or he/him/his
Seems like they rebranded as the New Green Party
Hopefully she will focus more on the environment than on bashing Israel. That is the main reason the party is in such bad shape. The people who vote Green are mostly interested in the environment and new policy ideas around that.
Amita uses he and they pronouns btw.
Oh mb, just saw a small picture on my phone and assumed it was a woman. Just poking fun at the fiasco over the party's internal conflict over foreign affairs.
>  That is the main reason the party is in such bad shape. 
No the reason is an advisor to the last leader threatened to replace 2/3rd of the party publically. Then the leader shut down all communication with Atwin
Poke away, it's a rich subject matter
Its incredible how much inequality this housing situation has created. Its not enough now to work hard, get an education and a good job for a lot of young people. Now you've got to have wealthy parents on top of that to buy a house in many instances.
WTF happened to this country?
How does one get rich parents? Asking for a friend.
Ironic that if Mom and Dad's homes hadn't skyrocketed in price, the kids wouldn't need anything for their first home.
The mortgage firms pushing this story hard. This the 3rd bank having done this sort of story now…
Man, generational wealth is some bullshit.
I had to get a job at 16 so my mom could afford rent for us and my 2 brothers. 
Not to mention having to bankroll my Father a few times when he was getting sober.
Where is my 140k?
 (Shit, I'd be happy with 1,400 damn)
And that, kids, is called generational wealth.
People need to take more advantage of the right to unionize.
Given that the median Canadian home is probably about 600K, virtually everyone who grew up middle class with parents who owned a home would have access to the equity required to do this.
Ah well mine are currently sitting on my mantle.So not much help there. Useless bastards 🙄 24, and I’m totally screwed for life. (I am willing to relocate though)
What percentage of total Canadian population is affluent. 10 to 15%?
The fact of the matter is most parents are taking out loans against their home to help their kids buy one, this isn’t rich parents. These are very good middle class parents who care about their kids.
LMAO we're fucked
The street I live on in Calgary is seeing a changing of the guard with almost all the homes previously occupied by original owners from 1967 being bought out by younger families. I’m pretty sure all of them have had significant financial support from their parents for these purchases even though both partners work full time. It’s become almost impossible for an average couple to save for the down payment against the rapidly increasing home prices. 
Meanwhile these homes were originally purchased by single income families where mom stayed home  and took care of 4 kids. 
The unsustainability is real.
The most satisfying feeling is when someone who makes less than what I pay in income tax lectures to me how great this country is whilst living in the home partially financed by others (parents). I pay for the the things that make this country great, while I look on from my rental unit.
sell drugs.
So does this differ from the other study from CIBC?
The CIBC report had 1 in 3 buyers being gifted $82K, or on average, $27K per buyer ($82K/3).
Here it's $145K. Is it different as these are the 'wealthy' families only, and thus the increase in gift size?
Nice if you can do it! Good for these folks and kids. It’ll get them into housing.
hAH fuck people are put of touch. Title should be 
If you don't have rich parents or family, fuck you hahahahaha
I didn’t even have parents :(
You are doomed to repeat the lives of your parents.
If they don't own a house, you probably won't either.
I'm supportive of LNG development, but did they really have to name their company "Woodfibre"? Are they going to be shipping non-GMO natural gas too?
LNG will replace coal for a lot of Asian power plants. Either we export it or the US does. Eco-terrorists attacking all natural gas projects is self defeating. Fuck David Suzuki
Its location.
Woodfibre BC
LNG can also replace bunker fuel in freighters (we cant trust them with nuclear) and can be a source for blue hydrogen
Chapman's made their temp pandemic pay permanent for all workers.
They are a good employer fuck off with this nonsense
It's just some fuckwads that are boycotting. I don't usually buy ice cream this time of the year, but I'll get some Chapman's this weekend because they're doing something great.
I love their ice cream and now I have another reason to support them
For those who won't RTFA:
> **Vaccines not mandatory — but testing is**
> 
> According to the company's new policy, any employee who is not fully vaccinated against COVID-19 must take two rapid tests a week. The company pays for the testing.
Well ya know who your shit employees are now. Stupid idea Canadians trying too bring down one of the few good Canadian companies. Real patriot fuck tards.
$1 per hour raise for employees who are vaccinated
Gonna start buying me some Chapmans.
By boycotting they mean a couple of people on Twitter hashtaging about it. Nothing will happen. They will still be in business next week.
This is like the Streisand effect. These people who make a big stink and want to boycott Chapman's are in fact giving them free publicity and encouraging others to buy their ice cream. Good work guys. Mission accomplished.
>"There's just not enough Canadians that are anti-vax enough to send us hate mail and to affect our sales," he said. "They might think that their boycott could actually do something to us, but we would never notice."
LOL
Bought some of their Black Jack Cherry frozen yogurt yesterday - delicious. We also love their ice cream sandwiches, the ice cream is so much better quality than the usual grocery store ones.
Joining the cause.  Had some Chapmans last night.  Will buy some this weekend.
since their whole thing is dietary restrictions I doubt a boycott will effect them too much. Their core market has nowhere to go.
i used to buy the 5 dollar big ol' buckets of ice cream. 
now im only buying chapmans.
"Chapman's Ice Cream receives hate mail from confirmed morons over vaccine policy"
made a point of purchasing some Chapmans product today
Going to pick up some chapman's...
\*Adds 4 flavours of Chapmans to my shopping list. Maybe 5. \*
I am buying more Chapman.
Yeah from people about to lose their sense of smell and taste, fuck 'em
Pretty sure the pictures are proof that they were not members of the media watching on, but active participants being handled together. Wonder if The Narwhal can be held liable for breaching the court order.
You know what I find rather disconcerting? The fact that in order to provide media coverage and have access to the protests you must agree to put a positive spin on the protests.
So these journalists are sharing living quarters with the protesters?
Journalists or protestors?
The Narwhal has become (has always been?) a ridiculously biased source on this subject. 
The prevailing narrative is actively suppressing the voice of the Wet’suwet’en people, including female hereditary chiefs who were stripped of their titles by the other "hereditary chiefs" for speaking in favor of this project.
Thank you to our brave LEO doing what they can to maintain law and order in this country. Thank you to narwhal for showing their bravery.
This pipeline is for China, right? To get fossil fuels to China most efficiently?
It must be really tough with politicians criticising them for actually enforcing the law.
"don't listen to David Suzuki": David Suzuki Foundation. Love it.
I was at a green party zoom fundraiser where Suzuki was the main event. It was horrible. You would think, preaching to the choir, it would be all rah rah. 
NOPE, he ranted like my senile uncle. Going off on everyone and basically blaming the people in the call for climate change. It was crazy to see, he was attacking his fans and supporters vitriolically.
I could see the hurt and pain on quite a few faces, it was rough. Didn't understand the crowd at all.
Maybe Suzuki can start by blowing up one of his mansions or his private jet.
Or are these all needed for his five kids to maintain their lifestyle?
I used to be a big fan of his. Unfortunately, the hypocrisy of his actions vs his words have left me to just tune him out (just Google his planes, houses etc).
People focused on that but the other thing he said caught my eye,
"We cannot go on having a food chain that is 6,000 or 7,000 miles long,” he said. “We’re a northern country, why the hell are we able to buy fresh tomatoes and lettuce and fresh fruit 12 months a year? We’ve got to start living in a way that reflects the place that we live.”
I hope he means he wants to see local greenhouses ramped up because otherwise it sounds like he thinks we should only be allowed to eat what we can grow here in the winter as is.
Time to retire to your mansion in Vancouver.
The spirit of Wiebo Ludwig rides once more.
I really liked the guy when i was a kid but it turns out i was mistaking him for one of the actors from The Beachcombers.
Yeah, that's why Vancouver is freaking out now - the pipeline is out, no gasoline, everything is collapsing without fuel. Let's put it on the barges and truck it from elsewhere -- that's very environmental. Some people live in alternative reality -- so they should be the ones having no access whatsoever to the necessities that are afforded because of the efficient delivery of fuel.
>“if our leaders don’t pay attention to what’s going on” there will be “pipelines blowing up” 
Suzuki says he doesn't condone violence.
If an activist stated:
>'if Trudeau don’t pay attention to what’s going on the Parliament buildings will be blown up and there'll be dead politicians and a dead PM.'
'Not condoning it though.'

- David Suzuki
[deleted]
Imagine if someone on the right had said, "if our leaders don’t pay attention to what’s going on there will be abortion clinics blowing up."
I've crossed paths with him a few times over the years and I'm not a fan. I don't think he's done right by Canada, possibly due to the legacy of Japanese internment. In a few years, David Suzuki will die and I'm sure his checkered legacy will be washed clean. But he's been a senile old coot for a while.
Don't know why people pay any attention to this man still.
But if I say something like that CSIS and the RCMP would be all up in my ass, and rightfully so. It's inciting terrorist actions. But what will happen, zero.
Hey I haven't said something in a while to gain cultural relevance. Hold on.
*"Says some terrorist shit."*
Oh yeah, ha ha, sorry about that. I'm totally culturally relevant, you know.
As an immigrant, I took offense to his ["Canada is full"](https://archive.canadianbusiness.com/blogs-and-comment/david-suzukis-immigration-stance-isnt-xenophobic-but-heres-why-its-wrong/) comment a few years back.. He's a NIMBY hypocrite at the national level!
I remember when we used to have heroes. People that kids and adults could look up to. Role models. David Suzuki was one such role model for me. 
The internet took away role models. Is it a good thing that I find out how messed up people really are? Probably? I don't know.
Bill Nye the Science guy, John A McDonald, Craig kielburger. All these people are dead to me now, and it was only the truth that killed them in my mind. Is this a good thing? I don't know. 
I just know that we have about 1000 hate models for every 1 role model. Probably makes for a very cynical society.
Man spoke at my university when I was 18 and I eagerly waited in line to meet him after to shake his hand and ask him to sign my book. He was such a jerk, rushing through and not having the time to treat anyone particularly kindly. I’ve had a bad taste in my mouth for this guy ever since.

Good news for anyone wanting to get the 4th best vaccine from the guys paying a settlement for putting asbestos in baby powder.
>Johnson & Johnson said on Wednesday Canada gave full approval to its single-shot COVID-19 vaccine for people aged 18 years and older, making it the first full approval for the vaccine globally.  
>  
>The vaccine was previously authorized by the country under an interim order.
Hallelujah!  Now the people who have been holding out for this shot can shift their goalposts to a whole new location.
Does this shot have asbestos in it like j and j's baby powder had in it for 40 plus years?  Drug companies eh
What do you mean? This vaccine is viral vector, just like AZ, and viral vector really isn't that different from MRNA. There's no need to shift any goalposts.
We all of a sudden really trust them lol.
I mean that a great many of the people who were waiting for this vaccine as opposed to the others are just opposed to being vaccinated against Covid in general.  They asked for this one because it was unavailable.  Now that it is available, they will find another reason not to get it.
Is that really a thing? Obviously I don't know every unvaccinated Canadian. But I've never heard a single person say they wanted J&J.
This is indeed a thing.
Well random person on reddit, if you say it, it has to be true.
Early signs ? 
Ignoring making her minister of finance? Ignoring making her deputy pm ? 
She is the succession plan for when JT decides he had enough.
headlines ready to paint all her critics as misogynists
Early signs? You've been publishing puff pieces about her all year. Clearly our oligarchs have already selected their next puppet.
Her ambitions have been pretty clear for a long time now.
She's going to be the Liberal punching bag once the economic realization comes in that borrowing a ton of money and allowing massive amounts of people into our country to hold down wages won't lead to prosperity.
Once the middle class stops seeing their house prices rapidly rise as borrowing costs start to go up and everything else. The Liberals will be given a boot. The next leader is toast. And so is everyone heavily associated with the current policy.
I'd be interested in the biography to see how she handles the hot potatoe of a grandfather who worked for the Nazis and gave her her first publishing job.
She won’t win though
Look forward to the chapter explaining her collaboration with Nazi groups in Ukraine. Just following in her families footsteps.
I suppose such a read could become useful if we encounter another toilet paper crisis and I need to wipe.  Otherwise, this work is a waste of paper.
Mark Carney will be the next liberal leader mark my words.
If I needed toxic kindling I'd just use the flyers I get in the mail
This is not shocking. Freeland has been positioned as a leader-in-waiting since pretty much day 1 of Trudeau becoming PM.  And honestly, she'd probably make a very good Prime Minister.
>She is the succession plan for when JT decides he had enough.
This succession event will be announced not by white smoke emanating from 24 Sussex, but by a wayward Google search query at 3am: "how do you stuff more cash into a carry-on?"
Excepting people not to cry during trade negotiations is toxic masculinity.
She’s so condescending and patronizing. Perfect head for our nanny state 🙄
Same with Trudeau Sr. Borrow and spend. Very popular, yet imprudent. Unpopular austerity was for Mulrooney, Chretien, and Martin.
Yup, and then Mark Carney will swoop in to save the day
Ooh boy, if we held people accountable for the actions of their grandfathers nobody would have a job today.
She probably doesn't.
Wiping with that will leave more *product* on your but than you started with.
> In a news release, Triance said the RCMP's initial response to the woman's complaint was "not in line" with the Kelowna RCMP's investigative standards. "I have very high expectations of my police officers when it when it comes to professionalism, respect, accountability, and how we deliver our police services," Triance said in the statement.

A better apology would have been to immediately resign.
We investigated ourselves after public pressure and found nothing wrong with ourselves.
Fuck apologies, do your job.  I, as a Canadian, am past sorry, enough of your bullshit.
Not arguing with your larger point, but this is interesting:
>70 cases of sexual assault were reported to the police in Kelowna in both 2017 and 2018 according to Statistics Canada, 40 per cent of which were dismissed as unfounded — three times the national average.
Becaude in early 2017, it was found that the national average for sexual assault complaints dismissed as unfounded was [19.39%](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/investigations/unfounded-sexual-assault-canada-main/article33891309/), and 40% is only double 20%, not triple.
Maybe it went down over the next two years in response to the Globe and Mail's Unfounded series?
And no one fired or disciplined?
Meat's more expensive, dairy's more expensive, fruit and veg are more expensive. Guess I'm eating rice and beans.
We need to get rid of supply management. It’s horrible for consumers and doesn’t fit in to our free market economy.
They think they will make more , but people will just buy less .. and they will make less.
Good.
> The “supply management system” protects Canadian dairy, poultry and egg farmers from international competition by imposing massive border tariffs — as much as 300 per cent — on imported dairy products. The system also sets quotas for how much each farm in Canada can produce, and guarantees a “minimum” price for the milk they sell.  
And this is the result.
I guess I will simply stop drinking milk. It’s entirely non essential anyway
Another Monopoly, that is protected by the government, screwing over Canadians.
Sounds like Max Bernier was right  ... Imagine that.
Smiles in lactose intolerance.
The quicker the herds decrease the better, you don't need stressed-out cow milk anyway. Cows eat grass, not soy or corn lol.
I don’t see the point of this article, its really stupid to vilify farmers for this. Everything is costing everyone way more these days. If the farmers cost to produce a liter of milk last year was 60 cents a liter and this year it’s costing 75 cents a liter, of course its going to have to go up. Being a dairy farmer is literally a 365 day a year job - They should be entitled to make a fair living too.
Milk is fucking gross.
I only use milk for cereal and when the pandemic began I switched to vanilla oat milk.
I don't hate dairy milk, but I don't need it in my life anymore and likely will never need it again. 
I fucking love cheese though
All according to plan. So you'll be eating bugs and living in a cubicle.
Right. What I don’t understand is that driving the price is only going to cause consumers to find alternatives. They’re only hurting the loyal 2%ers.
Not a dairy farmer here -
So New York got rid of supply management, and their state government did 100s of millions after 100s of millions in bailouts in fairly rapid succession.
What ends up happening is quality goes down, and politics shifts the cost to all tax payers instead of milk consumers.  Price shifts a bit too but nothing wild.  
Supply management keeps production from being flooded, it has some very tangible benefits.
That’s how you end up with a handful of large factory farms grabbing a large majority of market share, then they jack the prices right back up anyway.
I will buy less and tell my kids to cut back. A dairy farmers of Ontario commercial just came on tv as I type this suggesting I get some milk for Santa, yeah I don’t think so. Santa’s getting herbal tea this year.
Sorry, but isn’t this a good thing though? Obviously not the massive spike in prices but that we’re protecting Canadian dairy so our country doesn’t become dependent on imports for everything leaving us in ruin whenever another catastrophe hits like covid or a supply chain breakdown? I’m open to changing my view.
Lol you don’t want to support people who work 365 days a year to make sure you have food on your table but I’m sure you have no problem buying that stuff from China on Amazon or Wal-Mart.
He was called basically Hitler for that.

So they finally admit that they were lying about N95 masks being useless to cover up inadequate and incompetent government procurement.
Oh sorry, not lying, just "***shifting the message"*** **in Newspeak**.
Crap like this gives the fake news folks ammunition.
Don't give a shit anymore. Time to move on.
> Possamai wants to see public inquiries into the handling of the pandemic by public health officials, especially the failure to treat the virus as airborne.
I think their failure to communicate effectively is one of the biggest sins they committed.  That weakness led to far too much confusion, dissent and arguing that has seriously hampered efforts to fight COVID.
I think mask effectiveness is another area where there's a lot of misinformation.  This is the best article Ive found on the subject and it made us switch to wearing KN95s
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-we-need-to-upgrade-our-face-masks-and-where-to-get-them/
Yeah, just a bit.
We still have to say this today? FFS, procedure mask are not meant to protect the wearer but the people around them. In the end, if everyone wears them, they reduce the risk of transmission of the virus. The person that said N95 is useless is pretty stupid IMO.
Thank you, bat wing lover's of China. FFS. This has to end.
New immune escape variant detected in South Africa https://github.com/cov-lineages/pango-designation/issues/343 classified as 'urgent', haven't seen that before
This essentially restarts the pandemic as there is no cross neutralization with delta
Edit: and the news has picked it up 
https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/covid-super-variant-mutations-cases-found-south-africa-botswana-hong-kong-1316864
Round 2 ding ding ding
Thats what I said when this all began, I called the lie  and I called the consequences.  I even called the reason for the lie, which was admitted late in the spring.
Thing is you need to be fitted for an N95 mask and have no facial hair as well.  Which is argue 99% of the people wearing them don't know about, or would do.  Pretty sure N95 mask or not, means you can still spread the virus according to both articles.  Maybe just a slower rate?
Let's rename masks to "spit guard". Then it becomes clear it's for others' benefit…
You are exaggerating what this poorly conceived article said. Really, it's just a lot of speculation and "could" statements. Nothing definitive. Relax Sparky.
It's really not that simple. Covid, and more so Delta, are the exact perfect mix of lethal and infectious. And luckily both are volnerable to the vaccine.
Something new meeting all those targets is hard.
For example other variants that are more vaccine resistant tend to be less infectious, or less lethal.
As I breathe with the KN95 mask on I can see it expand and contract noticeably with each breath.  That’s as good a fit as any body is going to get I think.  It doesn’t mean there’s no leakage but it is an indicator that you're sealed up pretty good.  I treat Foggy glasses as meaning there is definitely insufficient sealing
Even fully shaved I couldn't get a proper fit on an n95 when I did my fit test. Sure it was sealed when I didn't move, but when I had to do the specific head movements it always unsealed.
So N95 works just like vaccines?
N95 without a valve should stop you from exhaling viruses as well or better than a surgical mask.
And the researcher's "could" statement refers to monoclonal antibodies.
>(predicted escape from most known monoclonal antibodies)
That is not a problem.
Let's see where this has gone in 6 months. It could be nothing, or it could be the next big unfortunate thing.
RemindMe! 6 months
when we're elbow deep in B.1.1.529 this time next year you'll remember where you heard it first
If I am not mistaken, the **unicorn represents Scotland** on the [Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_coat_of_arms_of_the_United_Kingdom) and the CoA of Scotland.
Therefore, as a symbol of Scotland, **there is no relation** between the Unicorn and the French or the French-Canadians.
I think our coat of arms look badass
Now how about them Legs of Canada?
Colonialism. /s
Not surprising.
Surprised that people still fall for it though.
It’s also on Reddit as well. Post anything even remotely critical of the Indian fascist regime under Modi and one immediately gets accused of being a Pakistani or Sikh nationalist sympathizer. 
Also, the criticism from the Modi fanatics against Jagmeet Singh is insane. Singh is a democratically elected leader of a Canadian party, not some dude running for election in India. They need to tone it down.
Opinions, even those of large parts of a nation's population, can be shifted so easily by manipulating medias / social medias. Even video nowadays can be entirely manufactured.
This can and probably is happening in our country as well.
We need to find solutions to filter through that noise.
Jagmeet Singh can be popular in Canada as barely few know about the terrorist Jarnail Singh Bhindrawale here
[https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/canadas-top-dem-leader-jagmeet-a-fundraiser-for-terror-outfits-intel/1648643](https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/canadas-top-dem-leader-jagmeet-a-fundraiser-for-terror-outfits-intel/1648643)
Consider it similar to some politician in US praising Bin Laden
Why bother? NDP is always gonna lose federally anyway
Fall for it? Or pretend to fall for it in earnest to make the Sikh look bad?
Ha, good fucking luck. I lived in Surrey and the Delta area, and the Sikh were always the nicest and most welcoming people. They always had my back as a kid. A mostly white jewish kid who would have been more bruise and wound channel 90% of the time if not for them. If someone has a problem with the Sikh, I kinda just automatically don't like them.
Still, it's frustrating that people can pretend to be stupid enough to fall for it, and you can't even call them out.
You think Indian Nationalists are bad, wait until you acknowledge Taiwan is a sovereign country and that ethnic genocide is bad and you’ll be begging for the annoying Indian nationalists back after seeing how the rampant amount of CCP supporters in this country come at you and threaten to kill your family
>Singh is a democratically elected leader of a Canadian party, not some dude running for election in India.
Except Singh is on record asserting that his Sikh people were victims of a genocide in India.
Bad comparison seeing as Bin Laden was public enemy number one in the US.
Maybe, maybe the better analogy would be US politicians supporting the IRA and Sinn Fein, or India making Subhas Chandra Bose a figure of honour.
What?
Fair enough, both are shitty.
Which is accurate…just like the Conservative leader says there is a genocide happening in Xinjiang, China
How is that a problem? The Sikh diaspora tends to be very outspoken about the 1984 Sikh genocide because they have the freedom to do so without persecution, unlike the Sikh community in India which is at risk of being disappeared or killed to this day. This isn’t unique to the Sikh community either. Any diasporic community whose migration roots from genocide and oppression HAS to be outspoken about it, because otherwise their homeland’s government will just cover it up.
Everyone’s turned into a real estate investor now. No education required.
Where will all the new Canadians live? More than 400,000 new permanent residents move to Canada every year.
I know realtors will hate me for saying this. The best thing about a sellers market, you can sell your own house without paying the ridiculous realtor fees. Most house are on MLS for a day or two before it sells. 
I have seen people list their house on Facebook, Kijiji, Purple Bricks, and I have even scene a sign on a lawn. They never last long if priced right. 
I listed my house a few years back privately, and had no problems selling.
Lol, "realtors finally concerned now that the home prices are too high for anyone to actually transact, and realtors outnumber listings".
Maybe demand 50 year mortgages so people can keep buying? That'll fix it.
Please pause the endless increases in immigration quotas. I don't mean stop immigration, that's ridiculous, just stop turning the screw tighter each year. We need a breather
I'd like to see us embrace the favela concept on the national level, that way we could offer Canadian citizens affordable housing while ensuring we can continue with unlimited immigration.
Citys need to stop  pandering yo nimby groups and build .
Kingston ontairo  is ten years behind  in housing growth  beacude  of these idots  screwing us.
It's funny when we combine greed with basic human needs. Let's keep doing it, North America. What did Reagan say? Greed is good? Or was that Gordon Gecko?
Just building new units will not solve this issue.  Not while we have investors snatching up housing stock, not while we have realtors inflating housing prices to pad their commissions, and not while we have Single Family Zoning and car-centric community design province-wide.
I see resemblance as to how Mexico was in the 80s where politicians would buy into stocks at low prices knowing they'd boom. This is an artificial matter which is being fueled by politics it's not like Canada doesn't have the land. Avenues to use it and make things accessible are being restricted by the people in power and their friends. Take a drive in the outskirts of the GTA and Vancouver, and tell me you can't find places to build communities and an operative transit system linking those to the main systems
The myth that there is a housing shortage is getting tiresome. The real problem is individuals who own multiple units and rent them for obscene prices. If real estate wasn’t being treated as a commodity we wouldn’t have this mess.
They only care now because it’s affecting their commissions. Less houses to sell and when their buyer clients lose bidding wars, this all means less money for these vultures
Trudeau could give less of a fuck.
Obviously Trudeau's plan for record immigration won't worsen this at all.
When is someone gonna step in and say houses are needed for living not investing, if you have a roof over your head there's no need to buy multiple more
A realtor's opinion on this topic is not bias at all.
I'm curious how all the mid-low tier realators make big money with low inventory. Do they share among themselves or do a small percentage take the lion's share and brush crumbs to the others?
Ya well these realtors are part of the problem too
Well, we all need an extra bedroom for an office.

Can we please stop giving her attention? The only reason why she keeps these rants going is because of the attention it brings, leave her alone and she will probably shut up.
Is it supposed to matter what Doug Ford's daughter thinks?
Also of note:
Her husband is a juiced out roid freak, so he is perfectly fine injecting himself with a cocktail of whatever some guy behind his gym gives him in a brown paper bag, but not a medically tested and approved vaccine.
Absolute insanity
They don't make violins small enough for those cases.
I never want to hear any rant called “sweaty” ever again
What is with Ontario provincial leaders and having fuckhead kids?  I eagerly await the news story of DeLuca's kids kicking puppies or something.
If evil doesn’t win, how do the Ford’s stay in power? Her vote buying dad and crack head uncle won.
How is this news? Who cares?
Her whole family is trash. Hope her husband gets fired. Losers the whole lot of them.
Ah do all of the ford's are morons, good to know.
This is tabloid information, not news.
Let's replace "Doug Ford's daughter" with "Idiot woman".  It would be just as newsworthy.
'Juggernaut' nickname? So disturbing for a cop
It's all pretty on-brand for Haynes, who states on IG that she loves "Jesus + Freedom"
She is 30 and he was 20 years on the force, which is kind of weird...
He wanted his freedumb, he got it.
She's so right. Evil doesn't win. 🤣
Well that was a fun read.
Oh yes, the Kennedy's of Canada for sure...

They’ve overregulated the residential and first time homebuyer rules to death with stupid stress testing and other BS, but have done sfa about this and it’s infuriating. You could drive a mack truck through the loopholes. 
Every investor client ever: I’m renting my current home in Toronto, this purchase will be my new principal residence
Banker: but this triplex is in London, you and your wife both work in Toronto 
Borrower: we’re commuting and the other two floors are for our kids 
Banker: seems legit. approved!
What do the "experts" suggest we do about it?
Outlaw it before vacancy becomes less then 1%
Two of my friends (married couple) just picked up their first home. Their agent said they should consider buying two more; one for retirement and one for handing down to the next generation. 
If that doesn’t sum up our housing crisis, I don’t know what would.
It won't get better until we a) give people better investment opportunities in this country, it shouldn't be riskier to invest in business or new shit or b) we make some rules around housing being for.....living in
I run by a few houses every day that have been empty for the last 2 years. Land is being used as bank accounts now. 
Thanks Tiff We need all the growth Macklem
It's insanely frustrating. I wish I could hate these people out of the market.
I priced out eavestrough for a real estate agent recently that has purchased TEN properties the past few years. It’s very obvious this is what’s driving this bubble. I get about 3-5 letters in my mailbox from investors every month. Complete scum 
I’m not against people investing in property, but this has gotten out of control and is just plain bad for society, and it’s happening globally. It hurts our economy tremendously when so much of our income goes towards rent, this should be a bipartisan issue
Housing shouldn't be a business ffs
Food hoarding = SHAME
Shelter hoarding - INVESTMENT
Water hoarding = ???
A home is only worth whatever value a homeowner is willing to pay for it. The moment you outbid regular homeowners is the moment you push prices beyond its underlying fundamentals
Almost as if we need new taxes to curb such behaviour.
Ahhhh r/Canada's daily 2 minutes hate!
I'm so sick of hearing about this over and over and over
Outlaw corporations from owning residential real estate  
Ban foreign ownership  
Implement a yearly speculator's tax after your 2nd or 3rd home (per household) based on the current market value (You got three secondary/investment $1M homes? You're paying 200k/year per house, now, rented or not. $2M home? 400k/year) to completely destroy the speculative side of real estate investment. Either you live in your house, or you rent/own 1-2 extra homes, anything else will require you to dump way more money into the Canadian economy than your house could ever be expected to appreciate, decimating house hoarding as a valid investment strategy.  
For high-density housing units, require businesses managing them to be partnerships (not corps), with a maximum amount of units per partner (after that, speculators' tax kicks in). The rest can be managed by the government.
One home per natural person. I know it sounds authoritarian But maybe better than one person owning 5-10 homes, charging over 1000 a month for a unit.
Prices of houses too high? Wouldn't it be nice if we had plenty of land and timber to build the needed homes on. 
Supply and demand folks. Build more homes. Supply and demand.
I just don't get it.. I've personally created a financial model to try and justify buying property in Toronto as an investment. I'm quite financially savvy and I was unable to make the model work better than a low risk (read: near guaranteed) stock portfolio that takes 1h to read and put together unless one of the following is true:
1. Housing appreciates more than 5-6%/year or a few lucky 20% years. This was true for SOME narrow slices of time in the past, but can't be true year after year and certainly not going forward given the interest rate hike coming. 
Or 
2. You get around the tax on sale somehow by making it your principal residence. That utterly kills your gains.
Otherwise I think culturally Canadians have been conditioned into holding home ownership as the holy grail. It's really not a great investment.
And yet Toronto voted for a dude who has completely ignored this issue for the better part of a decade.
I'll bet absurdly unaffordable housing and rapidly increasing foods prices are going to help with that. /s
Living in rural NB I see some pretty horrible conditions with children in them. And I don't work in social care or live on a reserve or something where it would be even worse. 
Remember going for a walk with my wife and baby one day and a small group of girls young girls ran up to the stroller carrying something. When they got to us we realised it was a dead rat they were playing with like a doll. The three girls proceeded to tell us all about how they were all sisters with different Dads until a police car drove down the street and they all started yelling and running away. They lived in a rental the police visited basically weekly. Broken windows, garbage everywhere, kids playing on the busy street, never saw an adult around. 
I'm a pretty pragmatic, bordering on cold person, but some of the shit we see is fucked. And no government cheque is going to fix that.
Canada has many areas that are absolutely poverty ridden and in need of genuine societal reform. 
It’s a shame that many have the self defeating view that our poor either aren’t “in poverty enough” or that they deserve it
[258 Million kids around the world will never step foot in a classroom and with that 1-in-5 primary aged children in Sub-Saharan Africa don't attend school. It's well known that many children can't attend school, but we haven't done as much in the last few years that shifted our worldwide education. Helping anyone, anywhere will make a difference in the world's interest. So what can we do to help? Sign a petition, learn more about this education problem, educate others whether online or not. Create a better world with what we have.]
Okay? 
Can we get a detailed expense list for the other federal parties, or would that destroy the narrative?
Is this supposed to be a controversy? Yeah, setting up a studio costs money. So does running in an election. How would anyone be surprised at this?
I think it was a better and cheaper strategy to have an election studio than flying around in a jet like Trudeau and Singh did
Wow, a stunning revelation that the Conservative party spent campaign funds to fund their campaign.
Is this supposed to be a scandal?
Still cheaper than $600 million for a pointless election that ended with pretty much the same result.
Party uses campaign funds for campaigning. 
Please be angry about this huge scandal! 
🥱😴😴
This feels a lot like Scheer's convenient private school revelations, I wonder if this is the next move by the anti O'Toole team as their other efforts failed. It was at least my first thought when they mentioned "sources".
For $1 million, the CPC got a pretty shitty studio.
Relevant, but absent from the story, is the part where the Conservatives set this studio up and started campaigning from it several months before the election was called, while telling us each day, months before the writ dropped, that the Liberals would start campaigning for election any day now.
That's not a scandal, they're allowed to communicate as they see fit, the relevant point is that it cost a million dollars because it operated for something like six months straight.
That seems like a valid use of party funds.  People might think it's a waste of money, but it's not like he built a studio for his kids or something.
I thought it was a really good idea until O'toole went all anti-vaxxer and shot himself in the foot.
Oh it's not that much money...anymore.
[deleted]
Even if equal or more, we’re still in a pandemic I think
Also more climate friendly
Depends on what impact it had.  
And keep in mind, O'Toole still traveled around the country as well. Kinda required if it's a federal election.
Do you not think O’toole traveled as well…?
>Is this supposed to be a scandal?
...No, but that's not the point...  
Judgements of expenditure is an internal party issue. If the donors feel this was a dumb expense given the party's showing in the election, than it's their issue. If they're fine with it... Than they're fine with it.  
Same thing with Scheer's expenditures in 2019. It wasn't the electorate that sacked Scheer, it was the party membership.
It's not really meant to be a public scandal...  
This is an internal party matter. The only ones who get to choose to be either upset at the expense or not are the donors and the party membership.
Same thoughts. Really feels like they're trying to replicate the same path that forced Scheer out
They had the owner on cbc radio.  2$ raise during the pandemic and 1$ raise if you’re vaxxed and if your not vaxxed two pcr tests per week paid for by the company.   Buy this ice cream
Just gotta point out that Chapmans bought special freezers that can store vaccines….without being asked….without government money….because they were looking for a way to be helpful. 
I recommend either the Cookies&Cream or Chocolate Peanut butter cup.
I\`ll buy some Chapman\`s Ice Cream today.
This just in, 100 people that didn’t buy ice cream will no longer be buying ice cream.
I hope their sales double.
If I can find their product in a store near me, I'll buy it.
I’ll make sure to buy and support them, just takes a few trolls to make them feel overwhelmed. They’re doing the right thing for their employees.
There's always 100 people ready to take those jobs...
lol oh no. snowfakes can't buy ice cream.
Great press for chapmans.  Probly the first time they’ve been mentioned in a news article.
This was posted last week.  The consensus was that Chapmans is a god-dammed national treasure and we were all going to buy more ice cream when we did groceries.  I know I did :).
The lack of anti-vaxxer support won't hurt them in the least.
lmao at the constant signal boosting of antivax from the media
I’m going to buy a butt load of chapman’s ice cream now.
no boycott  here.
they have made amazing, helpful policy decisions.
I think I'll go buy a tub right now
To Do : support Chapman's by buying as much as I can fit into my freezer.
Absolute trash tier ice cream lmao, full of gum and fillers.  ENJOY!
nah.  it's one of the ones that gives me the shits.
good on him though for being fair. still too lenient imho since we are doing away with pcr tests as being a valid alternative to vaccines. (it's not) emergency measures should never take replacement for everyday use.
The crazy part is is that moves like this probably cost less than a marketing campaign, do more good, and get dedicated customers, yet a lot of other companies don't do it.
My freezers are too full, and it's cold but still found space for 2 packages of those dipped ice creams.

Conservatives have nothing to gain from pushing the antivaxx angle and everything to lose.
That hasn't stopped them, so maybe we can assume that they are not rational actors at this point.
This type of electoral reform would be disastrous for the Conservatives. No Liberal voter, nor any NDP voter, would ever make the Cons their second choice. For the Libs, second choice would be NDP, and for the NDP it would be the Libs. The Cons would be crushed....
I agree that Conservatives have nothing to lose from electoral reform (specifically proportional representation).  But I don't agree with his implying that the Conservative Party "splintering" into a couple of factions is a bad thing.
"splintering" into two parties (like Reform and Tory) would get them more seats. Reform would get much of the west while Tory would get much of the east (including the Atlantic). This would allow them to attract more blue-Libs and gain seats in the Greater Toronto Area. And since all (or at least most) votes would count, there wouldn't be vote splitting between the two parties. Then, after an election, if between the two they get a majority of seats, they could form a right-leaning coalition and govern.
They should try to be appealing to more people.
Most voters don’t line up perfectly with any party.  There are lots of Liberal voters who would rank the conservatives second, and even some NDP voters who would do the same.
LPC-NDP switchers may be more common, but there are lots of CPC/LPC switchers out there too.
"second choice" is not really a factor in proportional representation.  You're thinking of Alternative Vote (ranked ballot in a single member riding).  No one who's serious about electoral reform considers Alternative Vote as a solution.  AV simply favours the Liberal Party.  Proportional representation, on the other hand, could be very beneficial to right-of-centre voters.
I voted ndp in the last election and I would have ranked the liberals as my last choice
Of course, you're correct with regards to prop rep. However, when Trudeau vowed to get rid of "first past the post" he wanted to introduce the "ranked ballot" system. It would absolutely favour (and probably crown forever) the Liberals, but on the other side of the coin, the Cons have had a larger percentage of the popular vote through the last couple of elections (don't have the numbers at hand), and would probably win and unseat the Libs. Therefore, no electoral reform. Stalemate....😊
How much are illegal migrants charged in fines when they show up at Roxham road without a PCR test?
Answer: They are exempt!
How do you like them apples, Canadians??
These powertripping asshole CBSA officers should to be looking for new jobs, and the tickets should be made to disappear.  Unfortunately the more likely outcome is no punishment at all and people needing to fight the tickets in court.
> "They also said I was the ninth person they had ticketed already early in the morning. I said they should maybe watch TV and see what we were being told."  
A little person with a little power.
To those who are unaware of the exemption for BC residents and are screaming "not until November 30th!" here is some info. https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/british-columbia/article-bc-residents-can-cross-into-us-for-fuel-essential-supplies-without/
I'm always amazed by just how small a proportion of the population actually follows news of any kind.
I can't wait to watch this on Border Security !
Did Trudeau get tested after returning from COP26?
I love the way they manage to describe issuing invalid charges and refusing to withdraw them as a “discrepancy”.
I'm wondering if the specific border agents can be held liable and potentially sued?
The exemption starts NOV 30!!!
Nowhere in the story does it actually say that, SMH.
Yawn... who cares. 
Agent got something wrong.  She wont end up paying a single cent of said fine.
Do you just complain about illegals all day long on Reddit
Last time I crossed back into Canada, the border agent didn’t even make us take off our masks to make sure we are who we say we are, didn’t ask about covid symptoms, but they bitched and complained over a pack of cigarettes and 4 backwoods packages. I don’t understand.
“Huh, everyone is telling me the same thing, but no, I won’t do the least investigation.  Fines for everyone”.  Seriously, wtf IS this cop brain thing they all have?
CBSA: "fuck that, we have badges and do what we like"
This has nothing to do with news. Trudeau is supposed to communicate the message throughout the government departments, not just his media friends.
or even check updates before they leave, especially during a disaster. Oh no, life continues for me as normal. Everyone else, good luck
Won’t happen. Liberals cancelled that show by removing cooperation with the TV show producers.
Why bother? He’d still test negative for any kind of leadership.
The exemption hasn't taken effect yet.
Guess what would happen if some eco-warrior blew up a pipeline? There would be a massive oil leak, then the pipeline would be repaired and operational within days.
David Suzuki is a hack.
If I for one moment thought Suzuki was actually attempting a dog-whistling, I'd call it. I don't like the guy and have not been a supporter or defender of his, ever. 
Did I think he was attempting to incite eco-terrorism? No. Should he have made the comment? Absolutely not. 
Until I see evidence to the contrary, I suspect Suzuki was speaking to the larger "cornered dog" syndrome many environmentalists increasingly feel. They've been sounding the alarms for over four decades and it has continually fallen on deaf ears.
Politicians have been compensated handsomely to ignore the very real threat climate change poses to the masses. The rich don't care because they can afford to weather it better that the poor.
If people truly believe they are being "pushed to extinction" as these people do, it is reasonable to conclude they will start to "push back". that isn't an endorsement or incitement – it's observation.
And for what it's worth, it would be foolish to disregard it. I'd wager the RCMP already have people undercover within these movements precisely because they understand people are feeling more and more desperate.
"winking"
No it's just regular blatant incitement.
IMO, Harsha Walia's inciting people to  "Burn it all down" regarding churches was far worse. 
Honestly, would anyone be surprised if a group like XR started ramping up their tactics and attempt to sabotage infrastructure?
Serious question - isn't this violence incitement?
Is RCMP going to pay a visit or this guy is beyond reproach?
When he uses less than 20x the energy of the avg Canadian each year, then he can talk.  The guy is a savage capitalist spewing vitriol to fund his bank acct.
Funny no one remembers Wiebo Ludwig.
I know its just fiction but sometimes Star Trek can be scary accurate
>In 2026, at the start of the war, Colonel Phillip Green led a faction of eco-terrorists that was responsible for the loss of thirty-seven million lives.
https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/World_War_III
Well, obviously.  'Will no one rid me of this meddlesome pipeline?'
It read to me that it was a possible outcome if things continue, that doesn't make it a threat.   Being able to identify possible threats from not taking actions aren't encouraging terrorism.
I just hope that if a pipeline is blown up, that it's a natural gas line supplying eastern Canada. In the middle of winter. Ontario and Quebec would become pro-gas in about as long as it takes their homes to equal outside temperatures.
It was a Trump worthy declaration.
So is he a washed up environmentalist that no one would listen to? Or is he actually just aware of the “climate”?
He needs to have a talking too and held to account 
Blowing up pipelines would cause serious environmental damage. 
Inciting Terrorism (Eco) is a chargeable offense
This guy and Trudeau are cut from the same cloth
He who flogs his books at every engagement, has huge boats and flies everywhere. Shut up now Mr Suzuki.
David Suzuki isn’t a saint, in fact he’s more of a preachy celeb activist, but he’s not wrong.
“Eco-terrorism” is the corporate plundering of ecosystems across the world with blatant disregard for sustainability, environmental or cultural factors, and long term economic thinking in order to facilitate ridiculous profit for private organizations. Canada only benefits briefly and with decreasing returns from extraction. 
But yes cheeky David Suzuki “incited eco-terrorism” with one word and there’s no better example of destructive ideology on our burning planet.
Maybe he's a scientist, and instead of being an eco preacher he HAS a fucking point. The whole next generation is under the guise that corporation will burn the world around them for a profit...and it's frigging true. 
The government does nothing but ignore the people these days. In other times that ended in a lot of bloodshed, but hey just history right?
Infrastructure is one thing but when the people vote, and defend their country and the response is to send in militarized police, yea Canada you're starting shit, don't be surprised when it ends violently after literally just ignoring every sign and every call for help
This is his "Don Cherry" moment, he is old and senile, and I would bet this is the last we will see of him for the most part.  I don't for a moment think he actually wants people to go and blow up pipelines, more likely he just got caught up in the moment.  The thing is, sabotaging a pipeline won't accomplish anything.  Any time a pipeline fails catastrophically, the section is removed and analyzed in a lab setting to determine the root cause, and it would be very obvious to them if it was damaged intentionally.  So what would happen is, the pipeline would be shut down for a couple of days, there'd be a huge mess to clean up, and David Suzuki and his gaggle of sub-90 IQ followers would end up looking like a bunch of hypocritical morons.
FWIW I don't agree with much of what he says but he is deserving of some respect, he was at one time a very accomplished researcher and was obviously very successful in his media and business career.

The shelter is just a little hole in the wall when you drive by. They are the only shelter and take in animals from across the region, often sending dogs to the SPCA ST Johns for adoption. Hopefully the community can work together for the little helpless animals.   When I worked in Labrador I think a non-profit spayed over 300 dogs within a summer so the need to accessible vet care and adoption services is great. Unfortunately the government doesn’t give a shit about people there never mind animals.

IIRC the Iqaluit SPCA had to shut down as well, and it was the only animal shelter in Nunavut. There's just so many obstacles for places like this in remote communities.

Are we supposed to prefer the Liberal's inflation argument?
~~There is no risk of inflation~~
~~There is transient inflation~~
~~There is transient but not short-term inflation~~
Inflation is good for you
**Edit: Also why is our national news organization publishing blatant partisan attack pieces? They can't even bother to hide it anymore?**
This argument about how inflation today in Canada is just like inflation in the US in the 40's -- **after a fucking world war that killed 80 million people and burned-out half of Europe** -- seems insane?
I wonder what happens when a wartime economy winds down and turns back into a consumer economy in a world where major competing countries either don't exist yet, have had their industrial capabilities decimated from war, a good portion of working-age males are dead, women are still having to fight to actually get into the workforce, and the United States is literally an untouched-by-war manufacturing mega-power that has yet to outsource itself into a service economy trap?
> But people making knee-jerk comparisons with the 1970s and screaming about stagflation are looking at the wrong history. When you look at the right history, it tells you not to panic.
lol.
I'm not saying panic, but what a bad take.
The CBC never misses a chance to carry the Liberal Party's water.
> She pointed to a number of factors that have nothing to do with the Trudeau government's fiscal policy: global supply chain disruptions, COVID-19 policies in China, global droughts, pent-up consumer demand.  
So, to recap:  
- Canadian policies only contribute a small amount to ongoing inflation; most of it is out of our control.  So there's no point in us changing anything.
- Canada only emits 1.6% of all global emissions; most of it is out of our control.  So we absolutely have to change what we're doing before it's too late.
>The Conservatives' inflation argument is flawed
It's partly global issues, partly the fact most of us saved a shit load and are now spending, and partly money printing. The third part is going to make inflation worse than it could be.
God-awful biased take.   I watched the Kevin Page clip Wherry cites, guess what, it refers repeatedly to stimulus and spending.  Pierre is more economically literate than anyone in the Liberal cabinet.
Also what is this revisionist history bullshit?  Inflation "wasn't and issue" during the election?!  It was to anyone who was looking.  Cost of living was frequently cited as the most important issue in the election.
[removed]
I dont come to reddit for sound economic advice. I come to see kids practicing their memes.
I mean how many kids come here and think a legit printer is printing money? 
Then they compare our situation to Zimbabwe to sound smart. To someone who is actually smart they would know our situation is not even slightly similar. 
Then blame it all on Trudeau himself. Like you know he is a leader who surrounds himself with people smarter than him to guide these decisions. 
Take a moment and imagine how expensive your shitty Tim's coffee would be if the government just let the economy crash and burn. You cant? Because you don't understand economics? Awww. Better go ask a uneducated Con what to yell about next.
> the Conservatives sent up their ~~finance critic~~ clown, Pierre Poilievre,
There, fixed the article properly.
It’s not a partisan attack. 
Poilievre, as always, was talking absolute horseshit. Should the CBC, or any news org, just go along and *not* note when a politician is peddling nonsense? You’d prefer if the CBC worked alongside habitatual liars like Pierre to misinform Canadians? We already have Postmedia for that. 
Most Canadians are glad to have a service like the CBC, it’s a big part of what helps us avoid a situation like the American media landscape.
CBC did the deepest dive into WE but you keep beating that fake Americano anti-intellectualism drum.
They even invented a term for it... Preloaded stimulus
You are seriously concerned about experience whileTrudeau himself appoints his ministers based on gender? What an interesting position
You sound like Kramer discussing write offs
- Kramer:   “Jerry, all these big companies, they write-off everything.”
- Jerry:       “You don’t even know what a write-off is.”
- Kramer:   “Do you?”
- Jerry:       “No. I don’t.”
- Kramer:   “But they do, and they are the ones writing it off.”
> Then blame it all on Trudeau himself. Like you know he is a leader who surrounds himself with people smarter than him to guide these decisions. 
Hard cringe, my man.
He says the right things sometimes, but only when directed at his opposition. He is blind to his hypocrisy of his own party. Makes him a good attack dog. God damnit.
>horseshit
Horseshit is in the eye of the beholder. One can equally say that all of Trudeau's past comments downplaying the risk of inflation were horseshit. Has the CBC called him out on that? 
When you call out only one side consistently for perceived horseshit, you may be a partisan broadcaster.
Don’t you get it, it the CBC isn’t celebrating the conservatives 24/7 then they must be super pro Trudeau ! s/
The implication that these appointees are incompetent because they are women, regardless of their education and experience, is just another demonstration of Conservatives marginalising themselves. The world in general, and most of Canada has moved on from these regressive views a long time ago.
Why is that cringe? Do you think Trudeau personally makes these economic decisions?
Your decision to ignore any instances of the CBC calling out other parties doesn’t mean they are partisan. It just means *you* are.
Who cares. After 2 years just how stupid do you think people are?
I wear a mask where I'm legally required to do so.  That's going to have to be enough.
Uh...sorry for the impoliteness...
Fuck off with the "new and improved" mask rules.
I'm double vaxed. The most protection we can possibly get right? That's what we've been told for years. 
So...if I'm the most protected I can possibly get...
Leave us fully vaccinated folks alone to live our own fucking lives now!!!
The only reason most are still wearing a mask inside is because it is required by the provincial government or federal government, not because they are scared of covid. People just arent worried about covid anymore. Vaccines are here and we were told getting it gives us back our normal lives.
So for most this advice will fall on deaf ears and the governments of this country should be grateful people are still wearing them at all.
What a fucking joke. People don't wear their masks properly anyways. Lol
I can't see too many people jumping up to comply with this...
*In an effort to better curb COVID-19 transmission, some countries, like Germany and Austria, have mandated medical-grade masks and respirators instead of cloth masks in public areas.*
Yeah that seems to be working well for them /s
I would like to know how many people that think this is good have ever spent most of the day in an N95 mask before especially one with no exhaust valve
the amount of double masked people in Toronto is crazy. You can see why religion is still so commonplace in the 21st century. People want to believe.
CBC at it with propaganda.
Remember the whole multiple mask BS they tried to push?
Oh....looks like being scared is starting to wear off....what else we got.....IS YOUR MASK SAFE ENOUGH? That should keep em' stupefied through Christmas.
This is dumb.
What this cut up T-shirt that’s been in my pocket for 18 months isn’t enough?
Seems people are still pretty stupid. Many don’t want to wear a mask at all.
Who needs facts, right? Let's just say the vaccine is bulletproof and leave it at that.
The article says you still need to wear one because you can still get covid even if you are vaxxed. 
Masks are important even when you're fully vaccinated, both   
PHAC and doctors say, because although it's much less likely, **infection**   
**with the virus that causes COVID-19 — especially the highly**   
**transmissible delta variant — can still happen.**
No. Double vaxxed with a mask is the most protected you can get.
High quality masks have been available for some time now so many of those of us who "jumped" to "comply" with getting better quality masks did so a while ago.
Yeah I had the advantage of already using these types of masks for crafting purposes well before Covid. Lots of nasty fumes come off crafting materials.
To me it's just logical to wear when there's a significant risk to the quality of the air I'm breathing, and that temporary red mark around my face from wearing it properly is probably the most annoying part and it really isn't a big deal. I do wear a clip on the back that keeps the mask from pulling on my ears though.
Yea it’s been 2 years, im kinda over safety theatre. Forgive me if I don’t take it seriously at this point.

Anyone want to explain what’s going on here since this article says almost nothing? What a joke journalism has become in this country. Getting to the point where journalist are too scared to ask basic questions.
Sounds like a group of people bringing their old world bullshit feuds to Canada.
I used to work at Strawberry Hill cinemas in Surrey. This has been going on for years. We had a bomb threat called in for a film called Jo Bole So Nihal (or something like that) in the mid-2000's. 
It's not in the papers because the police/Cineplex didn't want it to get out that they let a bunch of teenagers manage a bomb threat with basically no support from anyone.
We also had windows smashed, staff members threatened, etc.
I didn't like what some of the scenes in the movie Schidler's List portrayed, so I ripped the screen down and put the screen on trial in Nuremberg.

Independent cinema mafia?
If what the distributors allege is true it's a really bizarre course of action by the smaller Indian theaters. You'd think they'd want to spread Bollywood as far as possible, then when people want a complete Bollywood experience they can go to their smaller more focused theaters, rather than Cineplex.
What a stupid example of self sabotage and selfishness 🤦‍♂️
I always like it when regional violence is brought to Canada and made our own.  We're such a boring country without it.
This happens for regular films too. As someone from community, this is 100% the work of independent theater holders who want to change folks 20$ per ticket. They ve been doing this for last 10 years and everyone know who this is.
A lot of talk about ethnicities, and I just wanted to add that I learned that Canadians are referred to sometimes as Munchie Cakes by Italians. At least that is what my Italian aunt told us as our early Christmas party lol.
Cineplex sucks but this is not the way.
The Article: Distributors are pointing the finger at a group of independent cinemas they believe is perpetrating the mayhem in a bid to corner the market on screening of the films.
/r/Canada: The immigrants did this!
They should have torn the screen for airing the Eternals.
Jesus wtf is wrong with the comments here? 
Like read the article. 
Indian film was suppose to be screened, vandals damaged the screen because they didn’t like it.
We don’t know who the vandals are so assuming gets us no where

Everyone saying read the article didn't read the article, and nobody else did either.
There is a big section at the bottom that turns this into an issue of not being able to show certain movies.
Not independent theatres trying to make more money, because it's happening to them, too.
Must be white supremacy...
I am just glad this is not happening in Quebec. Otherwise you would have a field day bashing!
Pretty soon we'll have security like we do at the airports just to see a fucking movie. I hate people.
Yet we do not blame the local restaurant or pool store for incorporating for the same reason.
I don't blame them. When that priest in New Brunswick was convicted of molestation charges it was the parishes all over Atlantic Canada that had to pay the millions in damages.  
Churches and cemeteries in Cape Breton had to shut down because some asshole priest in New Brunswick couldn't keep it in his pants 40 years ago. 
I'm glad the survivor is getting justice, but it doesn't seem fair to make hundreds of communities who had nothing to do with it pay for the perpetrators crime.
Take the churches land back. 
This is a win win      no land, no church, no problem
The catholic church has caused as much, if not more, harm than many criminal organizations. It should be treated the same; pursued through the courts, asset's seized, disbanded and forever vilified.
Exactly. Literally every corporation does this. The primary point of creating incorporated entities whenever a new entity is established is literally to shield the other existing parts of the corporation from potential liability created by the new entity. That is part of every federal and provincial corporations acts.
If a local restaurant is liable for hurting hundreds, thousands of people then defaulting on settlements then yes it would be a story!
But what role did the parent church play in covering up what the NB priest was up to?  It's been very well documented that the Catholic Church (and many other churches) worked hard to sweep these abusive priests under the rug, while continuing to employ them and allow them to continue their abuses, usually by moving them to new parishes and new victims.  Your tithes support not only your local church but also the hierarchy.  The catholic church as a parent entity has plenty of money to cover these reparations but they cry poor every time the issue is raised by pushing the issue back on the local parishes.  
Catholics as a whole need to tell their parent church that they expect them to behave in a Christian manner and admit and pay for their incredibly unchristian actions in the past.  If they refuse, there are many other ways to worship that do not support a corrupt and abusive system.
The Catholic Church has without a doubt been a power of good and moderation for centuries. A true pillar of western civilization.
I raise you Enron, Nortel, or basically any company that's gone under. 
Oops.
I don't think it's fair to punish the group for the actions of the individual. It's not like all the priests got together forty years ago and said. "Look, Elliot was playing around with a little boy, the Bishop is sending him to Africa. Go tell your parishes and make sure they know the organization is more important than the law and morality".
Maybe someone outside of that priest and the bishop knew what was going on, but I doubt it. That's not how scandals work. It's kept secret.
That said, Rome and the Church as a whole didn't pay a dime for that scandal. It was paid by all the other Canadian Parishes within a 1000km radius. That doesn't seem fair to me. When a soccer coach get's sued for pedophilia they don't take the money from the surrounding school boards.
It's a double standard.
You forgot the /s
uh huh what is your point -- that those stories were covered extensively in the news because they were newsworthy which proves my point?
Suing the Vatican sounds far more effective to push about more measures to prevent this stuff, then sueing a bunch of small churches. also nice point about the suing school boards thing.
I agree that it should be Rome, I just didn't have the terminology correct, that's what I was trying to say.
If the Catholic Church didn't exist another religion would have taken its place. Likely Islam based on its expansion into Europe.
Many important institutions like universities were founded by Catholics along with hospitals.
the sole purpose of a body corporate is to limit liability.
So, if one evil pedophile cult wasn't there, another one would take it's place? Fuck off with that bullshit.
Your argument would extend to hospitals right? Another organization would have come along. Perhaps if the church wasn't robbing 10% of the cult members income, government would have provided the service.
In Canada, catholic hospitals have been defunded, closed or sanctioned by the courts for trying to impose their sky fairy morality on patients. Abortion, birth control, fertility not allowed by these chucklefucks.
Islam was the same as the Catholic Church before the Catholic Church came to global power. The Islamic renaissance happened before the European one. 
Not that it matters to argue with someone who thinks an imperialist church that ruled over the dark ages terribly and continued to exert their influence for centuries to help with genocidal policies is somehow good.
These opinions I’m sure are constructed by the internet and terrible discourse 
It’s purely ironic to hold the institution that kept the Bible out of the public’s hands and understanding for as long as they possibly could over centuries as a “true pillar of western civilization” whatever that means
Yes absolutely. Considering that Muslims invaded the Iberian peninsula in 711 and were only completely defeated in 1492 it sure doesn't sound like bullshit to me.  Not to mention incursion, invasions and occupations by Turks all the way into central Europe.
Your concept of centralized government didn't exist  over 200 years ago. Almost all services were provided by the church before that period that is to say schools, poor houses, universities, hospitals. Not saying there wasn't abuse or exploitation but that the catholic church is intertwined with western civilization.
Funny how the worst genocidal regimes during the 20th century occurred because they couldn't be checked by organized religion. Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia and Communist China.
It is a pilar because of its influence and impact that you agreed with (for better or worse). You remove the Catholic church from the equation and you fundamentally change the face of western civilization. It's why it can considered a pilar.
I hope no one pays good money for this foreign propaganda.
Okay, Ivison, okay.....the party that refuses to get fully vaccinated isn't the one out of touch? Really? What's next, blood letting? Owning the libs by bringing back smallpox?
"ideologically-driven Liberal government" says OToole as opposed to what? 
Cause the cons are definitely not a "super culty pure ideolog tow the party line or be fired" type party... /s
The only attention O'toole gets is from NatPost. 
Wonder how much donation money NatPo gives to that party.
Is Ivison in the same reality as the rest of us?
Conservatives are the only out of touch ones.  Just consistently missing the mark on what Canadians actually want while pandering to uneducated rural people.
The party that is throwing a tantrum about vaccine mandates makes *Trudeau* look out of touch?
>How it ended: Justin Trudeau complained that the Conservatives had not asked any questions about ending the pandemic, “which happens through vaccination, guys.” 
So much for a more constructive House of Commons. 
>"The government House leader Mark Holland is looking for co-operation to pass some new legislation, including extending some COVID benefits. He needs all the opposition parties to support his bills because committees are unlikely to be up and running until February. 
But the Conservatives appear in no mood to do the government any favours." 
Weird, Trudeau gets chided for not being constructive or helpful, by noting the Conservative party vaccine issue, but O'Toole is innocently "not doing any favors" by refusing to cooperate on bills.
“Errrrmmmm….National Post your boomer is showing.  Might want to get that checked out. I hear they have developed a vaccine for it!”
Meh, the opposition is going to oppose, and come out swinging, no matter who is in power. The elephant in room (or, chamber) is that right now, the persistent threat of leadership challenges means O'Toole is under more pressure than ever to unify his party members.
National Post should change their name to National Poop
Meh - a whole lot of nothing.
Worst satire piece ever.
Make Canada Great Again people probably do … they’re probably glued to FOX as well
Food is a more urgent issue to Canadians than a virus. If you don't leave the house, you can't get sick but you will always need to eat.
We can focus on covid and making sure people can eat
> ideologically-driven Liberal government
Wouldn’t all governments be ideologically driven though?
So this! O'Toole will destroy the CPC as we know it. Trudeau might get his majority in the next election because O'Toole is too busy pandering to the 10% anti-vaxxers. The CPC is an absolute joke
Also surf boards, their question period was the worst I've ever seen for level of stupid.
I wouldn’t disagree.
But I wasn’t saying that Covid is more important than inflation, I was just commenting on his hypocrisy. You cannot criticize the LPC like this while having science deniers in your ranks.
Funny enough the Liberal party is one of the least ideologically driven parties in the world. They take from both left and right as needed to get elected, and famously are accused of "compaigning on the left, governing on the right"
>Trudeau might get his majority in the next election
One can only bloody hope.
The ink was dry on the contract.  Clauses for cancellation and bad faith dealings should have been expected.   
Lawyers are the only ones winning this time.  Such a waste.
How much of the work had been completed?
Doesnt hurt to want
Tired of hearing of this fucking pipeline
I was hoping the union worker contracts would have been enough to sway biden
Oh they'll get it. Pipe builders these days know exactly how easily the Canadian and American governments will cow tow to angry mobs. The contracts were signed and they'll 100% have escape clauses for situations just like this. Kinder Morgan got theirs too, because they were prepared.
This one is a little different. They never actually completed the formal approval process for pipelines. The Obama administration declined to approve the pipeline on environmental grounds and TC never actually passed the environmental reviews. You can read the EO itself right here. It has lots of vague language that is designed to protect the US Government. Normal permitting would have given a lot more protection to the permitee. 
https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/DCPD-201900193/pdf/DCPD-201900193.pdf
The issue is that the Trump administration just issued an executive order to grant them approval to build. But an EO can be overturned at any moment (and that was explicitly written in the EO itself). All EOs generally have a clause that states that the president can modify or change it at any time. This is in contrast to standard permitting which would require the executive branch to go through a long process of proving that the permit was no longer applicable. 
That isn't to say that they can't recoup some money but this is by no means a slam dunk.

Gonna need extra supply with inflation on the rise
Need to drill to maintain production. The lack of investment in the last 5 years is starting to take it's toll. I forgot the stat was but I swear it was something like 20% of capital needs to be spent on exploration to maintain steady production.
Condemn and punish Canadians at the pump and then crank up production and send it elsewhere to burn.  Sounds like a perfectly Canadian plan.
Will this mean gas prices will drop down to some semblance of normality? They've been sky high making driving literally unaffordable for some.
Pre-pandemic levels isn't exactly a big boom.  Pre-pandemic natural gas was in the crapper; no one was drilling pure gas wells.
Nice.
Thank fuck
That’s is going to be awesome for Canada. My dads is a advisor in the industry right now and he’s saying theirs not enough equipment or labour  at the moment this means that manufacturing will increase and the labour shortage could cause a wage increase across the board (to help compete with inflation right now). If people are so concerned about the environment they just stop using or lower their consumption of oil and gas and destroy the demand for it the market place and bankrupt the oil companies.
Does this mean Albertans will stop whining and complaining finally?  Might I suggest putting some of that oil money aside for the next time oil prices crater?
we are so fucked....
Woohoo more glaciers melting, floods, tornadoes, fires, and droughts. 👍
Employment in the patch and our Province's "share" of earnings will only decrease however. Thanks JASON!
Canada: hey, Albert-ah, you need to diversify your economy, you know. Petroleum won't be in the cards forever.
Alberta: Quebec sucks, perequation blows, best summer ever and also, no, we will not diversify, we a one trick pony.
Fuckers are just daring people to start being militant at this point.  Knowing what we all know, to boost production at this level is a slap in the face with a death sentence.
Gotta fill those new pipelines.
Then we need new new pipelines for the production,
Then we gotta increase production to fill the new new pipelines 
Rinse and repeat.

More needs to be done for this case. It cannot be swept under the rug.
Police in Canada can literally shoot babies now and expect no consequences.
Good thing I'm not a baby.
Part of their **mission statement** says
>We conduct thorough and unbiased investigations where someone is the subject of a firearm discharge, is seriously injured, alleges sexual assault, or dies during an encounter with law enforcement agencies, including police, the Legislative Protective Service and the Niagara Parks Commission.
Their **mandate** is something else.
> Ontario's Special Investigations Unit (SIU) says it has received testing results that it was waiting on from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) linked to a high-profile case where a baby boy and his father were fatally shot by Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) — but nearly a year on from the shooting, the agency has made no conclusions.
So we can expect more babies will be shot and killed in Canada by the Police without consequence.
To serve and protect *ourselves at all costs*
> *OPP officers were reportedly told the man had abducted the baby from the area of Trent Lakes.*
"If we can't get the goddamned baby back from the bastard, we will make sure nobody will!"
For the folks struggling to reconcile the headline with the article, this isn't a story about police wrongdoing where the SIU determined that there was no wrongdoing.  This is a case about police wrongdoing where the investigation is still underway.  Jumping to the conclusion that nothing will be done is kind of pointless.
Personally, I think the officers who fired at the vehicle should simply resign.  Maybe there should be criminal charges, maybe not.  That's not something I care to weigh in on.  What I do know is that covering for one another by refusing to be interviewed is not going to accomplish anything.
They used horrendously poor judgment in responding to a vehicular assault on an officer and forgot what they were there for in the first place.  I don't care if the driver of the vehicle is a serial murderer on his way to murder cereal serially, there's never an excuse to fire into a vehicle when the reason the vehicle was of interest in the first place was because of its connection to a child abduction.
[deleted]
A little bit of perspective...
>Early information indicated police were called at approximately 8:45 a.m. on Nov. 26, 2020, about the alleged abduction, according to the SIU.  
>  
>Not long after, police located a pickup truck identified as a "vehicle of interest" on Sturgeon Road in Kawartha Lakes.  
>  
>Officers tried to intercept the truck, but it crashed into an OPP cruiser as well as another car on Pigeon Lake Road. One officer who was standing outside the cruiser at the time was seriously hurt in the process, the SIU said.  
>  
>Three officers then opened fire, striking the one-year-old boy inside the truck as well as his father.
Maybe there is other evidence, but the driver was a kidnapping suspect who was actively trying to kill other people. What if they let him go and he plowed into a parade while tryin to escape again?
why did they pay for a foreign government to investigate? The OPP is pretty corrupt but that's just strange...
Why is the FBI involved?
police investigated themselves and found nothing wrong scenario
Or a Gunsmith or a Firehall in Nova Scotia with people fearing for their lives.
The man had abducted the child, ran into an officer with his vehicle and went to run over the officer again - he was trying to kill the cop, the cop opened fired on the vehicle but contrary to robocop did not have perfect aim and is a human - one of the rounds hit the child in the vehicle.
The father is to blame here.
How do you figure that?
Talk about jumping to conclusions
Was the vehicle not trying to run over the officer because that’s a pretty good reason m. Otherwise One could just mow over pedestrians and put a baby in the car and use the apparent moral force field to allow them to go on murdering people. Human shields don’t work.
16 years of tactical training here to tell you that at no time is shooting at or near the abductee acceptable when disengagement is an option.  
There were literally hundreds of options the officers could have exercised that didn't involve shooting a baby.
Pretty sure you don’t need tactical training to know you have more than one option. Why not step away and follow instead of returning fire with a risk of hitting an innocent soul?
Is this after the big storm? That's awful - hope it's at least a little easier on them that what happened with BC. Is the Red Cross out there or any other organization? Have people been required to evacuated (and have they done so)?
Not just Antigonish, half of Cape Breton is in a state of emergency, there are dozens of highway washouts and multiple bridges destroyed leaving towns and villages cut off.
Weather taking out both coasts
That first pic should be titled "Place Culvert Here".
Well there's your problem - you're missing dirt!
Holy shit, I have family there
wouldnt be surprised if Cape Breton gets cut off like Vancouver Island.  
Ive been mostly fortunate where I live,  it rained all sunday and monday,  snowed a little on tuesday,  and aside from being cold and a little snow on the ground, it was dry today.
This was from today, yes. People have been evacuated (from a trailer park... with boats) and emergency shelter has been set up. Can't compare to BC, but still tragic for those who have lost their homes.

He didn't see it coming.
Wiarton Willie has died several times. I remember he also died in 1999.
Seeing this headline is like the movie, um, Groundhog Day.
They 2 months to train the keeper to look for his shadow I guess.
RIP Willy.
Again? If I ever reincarnate as a hedgehog, I'm staying away from Wiarton. And Puxatawney. I'll spend my life free and eating dandelions on the side of the Transcanada instead.
I made the drive up and met Willie once.  He didn't have much to say. RIP, or whatever the groundhog equivalent is.
There was a Wiarton Willie when I was a kid 30 years ago.  This can't possibly be the same one?
We are free from his cruel game of time!!
RIP,  does that mean winter forever?
Wait....if im reading this right, they hid this all year? lol
The end times are upon us
Ontario is on for an endless winter wasteland now.
We all will die life is transitory.
Bin him, green bin that is.
If only there was a more reliable way to forecast weather than easily spooked groundhogs.
He thought it was his shadow, but it was Death in disguise.
Oh, he knew and welcomed the end.
Can you imagine the hell he must have lived every day? Having the ability to see the future but trapped in the body of a groundhog, powerless to do anything? Horrifying.
Take my upvote
Same, grew up there, ridiculous this keeps coming up. Thought they switched to a statue??
I remember that also.  I  lived in Kincardin in 1999.

The headline is slightly misleading. There is already a vaccination requirement for non-essential travellers entering the US at the land border; this announcement expands it to essential travellers such as truck drivers as of January 22, 2022.
Excellent move. Hope it is implemented all over the world.
Good
oh no how will the boomers get to FL now.
Very misleading, thanks for clarifying.
They don’t enforce it at all. I just got back, going into the states they asked if I was vaccinated, I said yes. No proof was needed until coming back into Canada.
Bob’s Burgers is the shit.
It's already policy. This just extends it to truck drivers.
It's a misleading headline.
They are more vaccinated than younger age groups.
The boomers already got their shots in Florida last December before Canada had even seen its first shipment
The vast majority of unvaccinated are 18 to 39 year old.
They can ask in which case lying won't help. Most of the border process is taking yr word for it till they randomly don't lol.
That’s because if they catch you lying, they can set a number of extremely harsh punishments for you, including banning visa free entry for life
If you lied and then they spot checked your vaccine status, I’m assuming you would get a 5 year ban?
Just because they didn't enforce it for you doesn't mean it's not being enforced at all.  Get a grip...
I believe it can be a permanent ban. Never lie to US CBP, you don’t have rights at the border and they can implement whatever policy and decision they want.
I wasn’t going to I was just wondering g what people were risking for a day trip, which is crazy.
The Canadian government will do whatever is best for wealthy Canadians.
Import more ~~cheap labour~~ refugees? Sure!
Block ~~cheap~~ Chinese imports? Not a chance.
Think of the multigenerational billionaires, would you? They have to eat too.
And the Muslims worldwide go on complaining about Israel. 
Why can't Muslim countries take in Muslim refugees?
[removed]
Fuck that, we're already taking in enough immigrants. You take them in.
The internal struggle of rCanada between spiting China and taking in Muslim refugees
No thanks.
I’m okay with bringing unlimited refugees if we had the housing and work for them. Sadly we just take them with in with 0 plans or resources.
The World Uyghur Congress has significant ties to the National Endowment for Democracy, which is a U.S. funded regime change organization. Believing what they say about China is no different from believing Colin Powell about WMDs. 
Don't be gullible.
The Uyghurs are under legitimate threat I wouldve actually given them more priority over the Afghans if our infrastructure wasnt already strained. 
The Uyghurs are facing genocide under the CCP. Afghans coming here is just a lifestyle issue under the more strict Taliban.
Pass.
I'd rather have cheap made-in-china PS5 than refugees who will further strain our overstretched housing and health care situation.
We aren't a superhero or even that influential. China would litigate Canada until our very last drop of maple syrup if we blocked imports in such a fashion.
We can take refugees though, Winnipeg/Saskatoon looks underpopulated anyways.
We cannot block Chinese imports, they are our second largest trading partner. That would have huge negative implications in the economy, all just for a moral crusade. We are gonna have to live with what the Chinese do and they are gonna have to live with what the West does. Coexisting is better than kneejerk emotional reactions to foreign policy, which could increase tensions to Cold War levels.
Why does the CIA want canada to import more refugees?
Lol. The World Uyghur Congress is funded in part by the National Endowment for Democracy of the **United States**.
Would be nice to not have gotten into bed with the Tyrannical Chinese government but here we are.
I want less religion in Canada. Not more.
I'm going to guess at some point we will have a violent conflict with China, we will need everyone of the people they fucked over to help defend us from military defeat.
As if our Goverment would ever grow a set big enough to make these kinds of changes. The simple fact that everyone knows what’s going on with the Uighur people and do nothing/pretend it isn’t happening is more reason why I can’t take anything they say seriously. This is a terrible thing and we won’t say anything incase we upset the worlds super power? All good, I may do the same in their position but I wouldn’t pretend to give a shit at the same time. Same goes for Israel-Palestine and a hundred other inconvenient atrocities.

lol…30% of goods you have are fully made in china and 80% goods have parts made in china
at least make some reasonable demand buddy
How about we expand our medical system?
Train more drs and nurses, build more medical facilities and maybe look at local supply production
> The next pivotal change is to stop counting cases and concentrate instead on outcomes with personal and social impact. Testing everybody with a cold is expensive and ultimately futile if we all eventually end up infected. Hospitalizations and deaths become the only metric that matters.  
A thousand times this.
Opinion Highlights
(Dr. Jennifer Grant is an infectious diseases physician and a Clinical Associate Professor at the University of British Columbia’s Faculty of Medicine):
* Now, in the late fall of 2021, it is becoming obvious that while vaccines are still incredibly effective at stopping severe disease , they are less so at stopping transmission.
* Canada’s unspoken strategy has been that of COVID Zero , including strict border quarantines, widespread masking mandates, school closures and more.
* This is the same strategy that is being abandoned by Australia and New Zealand . The only option is to change to an endemic approach, which changes the emphasis on vaccination and prevention efforts.
* Time and effort need to go to identifying communities of high-risk unvaccinated people, understanding their reasons for hesitancy and working with them towards acceptance of vaccines.
* For example, vaccinating 100 people over the age of 65 is likely to prevent 3 hospitalizations, while vaccinating a 2000 member high school or university class is unlikely to avoid any.
* The next pivotal change is to stop counting cases and concentrate instead on outcomes with personal and social impact. Testing everybody with a cold is expensive and ultimately futile if we all eventually end up infected. Hospitalizations and deaths become the only metric that matters.
why does it feel like the goalposts move with every step we take?
Common sense?  Pshaw. Common sense isn't going to make Pfizer another $100 billion.  Come on people, we're all in this together!  Let's get that company over the $1 Trillion mark!
Seriously, how about spending some serious money developing therapeutics, or using the ones we have, since it's obvious the virus is never going away?  It's working elsewhere.
There is a growing number of anti virals (not yet approved) that seem to be effective enough to keep people out of hospital. If this is the case, then that will be the key driver for a protocol pivot.
Anti-virals are a thing, and there will be more of them for COVID infections. We don't need vaccines to eliminate it, eventually we will be so good at treating it, and it will be so endemic, that we won't care about it anymore.
If we're lucky, it might just mutate itself into oblivion like SARS-CoV-1 did. No one saw that coming btw.
Trudeau did a deal with Novavax (a traditional protein based vaccine) that is going into production after many delays in Montreal.  52 million doses ordered. Deal is redacted.  I guess to use up all the garbage vaccines that suffer steep declines in efficacy as posted in the Lancet, LA Times etc...the real question is why has Pfizer applied for a gag order in vaccine data for 55 years...I mean 2076 to find out what the current "vaccine" does?!  The group's involved are virologist scientists etc from Canada Australia Denmark etc and yup the FDA says, we only have 4 people working to cover 400 requests for data...read more people.  It's bigger.
Step one: lose weight.

There is actually some misinformation in this article... I mean I understand the sentiment but.. still.
How about, alter, change, amend, adjust any other word than fuckin pivot. Jesusfuckinchrist pull out your Thesaurus !
Wow finally a newspaper stating the obvious
Trust the experts! But not this expert.

No shit…
Nothing will ever fully eliminate covid, is gunna be like the damn flu and just keep coming back every year, spiking in the winter when people all go indoors.
I'm getting tired of thinking "no shit." every time I read a news headline.
What a fucking disaster
The vaccine doesn't work as people think it does, and 80% of this sub is vehemently in favour of mandating it anyway.
The party under most anyone else would make Trudeau's life just as easy. Mackay wouldn't have been any better. Pollievre wouldn't be any better. Ambrose, etc., throw out most any name and it wouldn't make it any better. The problem isn't the leader itself; it's the cancer within the party.
Canadians have made it overwhelmingly clear: we are a 'progress rather than regress' nation. What does that mean? 
It means we truly don't care who fucks whom, who smokes what, what holy book one reads from, or what a woman does with her body. We may have our own opinions but we keep them to ourselves and get our vaccines so we can get on with things.
There is a HUGE swath of the CPC that is dedicated to being against all of that and they hold a lot of power within the CPC. As a result, they can steer that car over the edge. Canadians know this and most want no part of it.
There are plenty of socially liberal conservatives who disagree with how the Liberals run the finances. They want nothing to do with the zealots in the party, but are  shackled to the nutcases nonetheless. 
And so, the party burns. Maybe not as publicly as the Greens (yet), but make no mistake, it isn't the leadership at the top that's causing all that smoke, it's the grassroots.
>So after weeks of getting pummelled over the vaccination of MPs, Mr. O’Toole came back to the Commons without the kind of clear answer that ordinary Canadians have to provide to get into restaurants. That helped Mr. Trudeau settle into an undemanding return.
>There was not a feeling of threat to the Prime Minister. After an election campaign where all opposition leaders ran against an unnecessary election, they can’t start threatening to topple the government now.
This CPC clown party is so incompetent that our whole cabinet could bust out a TikTok dance in the middle of parliament for PM Questions and still have more credibility then this so called opposition.
Edit: format
You have to split up the party on regional lines or the western MPs and Senators are going to just keep sinking the party.
Worst thing Preston Manning ever did was run the Reform outside of BC, AB, SK, and MB.  They should have been a regional party that wielded their power to support minority governments but instead they ended up handing the Liberals majorities by splitting the vote in Ontario.
There will be no path to victory for these current Conservatives unless they cast out the whackjobs.
This pathetic government.
How we have fallen from leaders that were strong to this.
Thanks Erin! 😊
[Paywall](https://archive.md/hsWtP).
That’s true
It’s a liberal belief that the conservatives need to go to the centre to win. Harper was the best thing for conservatives in a generation and didn’t do that at all. What the conservatives lack is true leadership and a spine.
If only Bernier had won the CPC leadership back then. We would have been in a much better shape with lower national debt and barely any inflation right now.
Ok, kids, lesson number 26: if Justin Trudeau further fucks up the country - which by the looks of the Throne Speech seems very likely - mainstream media is here to remind you whose fault is it.
> it's the grassroots.
Fucking Reform rump.  Preston Manning has done more harm to Canada and her future than just about any other failed politician.  He whipped up the belief that whack-a-doodle beliefs, fermenting in some Prairie slough, should be how you govern a country as complex as ours.
And it just won't die.
Thanks Preston.
> The problem isn't the leader itself; it's the cancer within the party.
Exactly this. O’Toole did what he needed to do, which was attempt to move the party to the centre and ignore the crazies, but he ultimately failed at it. 
I don’t see a way for the conservatives to move forward without ditching the SoCons and Trump lovers from the party, they will keep dragging the CPC down and prevent them from winning.
Conservatives will never get my vote until they rid themselves of social conservatives and I’ll vote for anyone that has a chance to beat them. While I do lean Liberal quite a bit the Liberal Party would need mandate changes for me to be happy with them. As for Justin Trudeau? Whatever he’s just like the rest of politicians, doesn’t really matter who is PM they’re all corrupt.
Wise words.
"Canada's natural governing party"
*"Overwhelmingly clear*". 
Isn't every province in the country conservative less NFLD & BC?  
And didn't conservatives win the popular vote twice? 
Not very Overwhelming....
>Canadians have made it overwhelmingly clear: we are a 'progress rather than regress' nation. What does that mean? 
>
>It means we truly don't care who fucks whom, who smokes what, what holy book one reads from, or what a woman does with her body. We may have our own opinions but we keep them to ourselves and get our vaccines so we can get on with things.
For such a progressive nation that apparently doesn't care about what people do in their private lives, we certainly have a hard on for people punching holes in paper from a distance and how parents choose to raise their kids.
I'd argue that all major political parties are regressive, and most people are too.
Hard disagree. The party has some turmoil, but hardly burns. Winning the popular vote isn't what matters in our system, but it's hardly a sign of a party "burning"  
I'll start by stating that you are probably someone who would never vote Conservative, and therefore irrelevant to the Conservative party. An assumption to be sure, but my point stands whether or not it applied to you specifically. the conservatives don't have to convince you to vote for them to win, all they need to do is up their numbers in the GTA and they'll do it. Which obviously means appealing to more left leaning voters, but thatès not impossible. It wasn't that long ago that they did that with Harper, and that's when such socially conservative things that you allege "-We truly don't care who fucks whom, who smokes what, what holy book one reads from, or what a woman does with her body."-were actually part of the party platform. I find it amusing that none of those things-opposition to abortion, homosexuality, official religion, and drug legalization-are in the party platform anymore, yet people seem to think that they are. Shows how effective good propaganda is I guess.  
What I gather from Reddit (very bad place to take a sample, but whatever) is that people who won't vote Con won't vote for them not on the basis of their platform, but because of who their perceived voters are. Which makes sense for sure, but that explains why the Cons can go as left as they ever have, and still not do that well with left-leaning voters. Because you don't trust them to act left-wing. Which totally makes sense in my view-why vote for blue liberals when red is the brand?  
My point is that going left has diminishing returns for Conservatives. There's only so far left they can go before they bleed to the PPC, another factor preventing them from winning this election. I think the reason they lose is because once you strip away any sense of community building, family-building, nationalism, and order from conservatism, all you get is the business argument. Which conservatives have often won, but it's the only thing conservatives win. So I think the Conservatives lose not because they are too conservative, but because they lack any conservatism whatsoever. Think about it: what do they actually conserve?  
Ah, well. Progressives are the ones who lose the most from a weak conservative party anyways. Because we can ask what have the Conservatives conserved, and we can just as well ask what exactly it is that Trudeau's liberals have progressed, other than housing prices.
>Canadians have made it overwhelmingly clear: we are a 'progress rather than regress' nation. What does that mean?
A propaganda slogan?
>There is a HUGE swath of the CPC that is dedicated to being against all of that and they hold a lot of power within the CPC. As a result, they can steer that car over the edge. Canadians know this and most want no part of it.
It can't be that big of a swath, and they can't have any real power in the party because none of their policies have anything to do with any of those issues.  The idea that the CPC will outlaw abortion or take away gay rights is total bullshit dished out to the gullible by the left-wing media.  Hardcore socons have never had any power in the CPC.
Also caring about normal working Canadians with the cost of living.
Expecting this government to follow through on campaign promises?
Womp womp. Lol.
Pharmacare, electoral reform, 2 billion trees, and probably that high-speed rail corridor from Toronto to Quebec City he promised a few months ago. 
Would've liked most of these (trees one is a bit ridiculous) to happen.
Quebec did Pharmacare without Otawa, the other 9 province could join together and have their pharmacare without having to wait for Ottawa.
Better, the 9 provinces can look at Quebec's experience, copy what worked and avoid the mistakes.
**Quebec's plan is simple**:
* A yearly contribution for working adults of between $0 and $170, based on your family income. ($14.74 per month)
* Those on collective (work) or private insurance pay $0 fee
* A Monthly deductible of $22.25 maximum.
* Plus co-insurance of 35% of the remainder of the cost of the prescription.
* **Hard cap monthly payout of $96.74** or $1161 per year if you are a working adult
* **Hard cap monthly of $55.08** or $661 for 65+ who receive less than 94% of the maximum guaranteed income supplement.
* Free for kids and students up to 25 years old.
* Free for low income families
* Free for impaired people.
* Free for elderly people who qualify (Some make way too much money to qualify).
**Why does it works?**
* Because when the government is buying prescription drugs for 8.5 million people at once, the negotiation power is multiplied by 8.5 million over the ordinary consumer.
* Because the government has the option to go for a generic drug, brand name drugs must compete.
**Why the pharmaceutical industry agrees?**
* First it has no choice if it want to sell drugs in Quebec
* Whoever disagrees risks seeing its competitors take its place.
* Second, it saves a metric shit ton of money because **it does not have to advertise in Quebec** since being chosen by the government gives that company a virtual exclusivity in Quebec. The Pharmaceutical industry spends more on advertisement in the US than it spends making drugs.
**Possible downside?**
* It limits the choice among brands, only the ones picked in the procurement process will be covered. But alternatives may be covered in special cases.
**But it doesn't matter**
* When the government negotiates with the pharmaceutical industry, the choice of drugs was made by a group where doctors, pharmacists and other health experts identify the drugs the Government should consider. So the drugs work because the government listens to experts with field experience. So you know the drugs they pick will work.
> Pharmacare
You'd have to be too young to remember Sheila Copps' GST pledge to trust a Liberal promise made during a campaign.
Not sure why anyone would believe Trudeau on anything.
Mr SNC Lavalin 2 Planes Blackface has never kept a promise on anything.
Along with the rest of issues that actually impact Canadians.
Because real priorities are not the priorities of the government.
When they first got elected I remember thinking maybe they will do some good.  The conservatives and their "barbaric practices hotline" was a really stupid play, it's time for a change.  Holy crap was I wrong.
free weed for anyone with a prescription?
Great, now we have to deal with sexual misconduct in pharmacare.
Trudeau is an elite. Therefore he has no idea how to handle the cost of living. His family could cast on Succession
He does care about us, didn't you see the fear mongering during the election? Scaring people into voting for him is exactly what our use is for him and his party. After that, he could give two shits.
Always remember that this is the government Canada wanted.
Just the ones that help the Big Three screw over Canadians and how he wants 1984 style censorship.
Thank you!  Ontario, at least, already has pharmacare infrastructure!  We just just need to fund it to cover everyone.
Between the elderly, those on social assistance and kids, the Ontario government pays like 70% of all drug costs in Ontario already!  Add two frickin' clauses in the Ontario Drug Benefit Act.  Fund it to about $2 billion.  And it would be done.  Universal drug coverage for every Ontarian for everything already listed in the existing Ontario Drug Benefit.  ODB is already tied and integrated with OHIP coverage!  It's already set up so you can scan your OHIP card at the pharmacy.  We just won't vote in a damn government that will do it.  Why are we waiting on the feds?
And must be too young to remember the controversy over her beaver shot
I know! My first nations community is still waiting for clean water.
You'd be wrong again if you think the conservatives now would be any better than what we have... even though that is a incredibly low bar
Free gropes and different experiences too.
>Always remember that this is the government Canada wanted.
... **out of the options available**.  100%.  However that is not the same as saying this governments actions are or are not what Canadians wanted.  We shall see how it goes, this is just the throne speech.
T'anks mum.
So many salty people…

If we drop the monarchy, I'll be the first President of Canada.
Yas Queen, so glad we fund this old lady to get such kind words instead of putting more money towards the environment 🥰
Nothing but words when’s the last time recently in the past 30 years we’ve had any aid or advances to help aid our country. They are notorious for their tactics in taking and that’s all they are going to be known for. Taking and holding title
The Queen? No idea who that is
Oh right, the mother of pedophile Prince Andrew right right right
Eh, ok.
*Edit* it's confirmed. Canadians here support pedophiles.
I wonder if her thoughts are with the victims of her pedophilic son Andrew. That's alot of thoughts for a tea swilling crumpet eater.
Thoughts and prayers are the cheapest thing an exceedingly rich Queen could do.
Scott Thompson is the only *real* Queen we need.

She hasn't been seen in two months, who knows who's sending the messages at this point.
Thoughts and prayers 🙏. Well isn't that just nice of her. 
That'll open up those highways. /s
Who gives a damn? End the monarchy.
Wasn’t that the whole plan in the first place? 
Drop interest rates so people start spending money they don’t have?
still worth it for anyone who plans to live in their home for the next 20 years, or anyone who got it done without paying carbon tax, or paid cash, or if you started a home based business, or they're sick of renting, or they locked in their mortgage already, or they own their home outright
Heavily indebted Canadians took on more debt because of the allure low interest rates... I'm shocked
I followed my ignorant rule of don't spend money I don't have. It left me with 0 debt but also 0 large assets. I am comfortable with that though atm.
Real question is why is the butt joint prefill so thick?
I’ve been hearing interest rate hike fears for almost 3 years now. They’ve only gone down since then. What a complete joke this housing industry has become.
I threw some money at the reno of my house for one simple reason - the inflation. The sooner I  part with the money for things I have to pay for anyway, the less of it I have to spend.
I didn't need to take loans for this though.
That's plain old vanilla financial irresponsibility. No one to blame but themselves. I'd have absolute sympathy and tend towards interest forgiveness, even loan reduction for people borrowing to make ends meet: groceries, pharmaceuticals, etc. Even renos if there was like a roof leak or basement flooding- something essential and vital. 
But people redoing decks and patios and modernizing kitchens and floors for resale value? That's investment, YOUR investment, YOU are on the hook for the risk and the return.
boo fucking hoo
$200,000 for home renovation, what the fuck you can buy a new house in most countries.
Honestly if interest rates go up and the market gets a supply shock with people that can’t afford their debt, I’m gonna be very happy to have an opportunity to get into it
As someone on the outside looking in at the housing market, am I supposed to feel bad for these people?
does cbc go out of their way to specifically find unsympathetic people for stories about real estate?.. they spent **$200k** on renovations!! mostly so their daughters could have a proper 'learning space'... cry me a fucking river
"I made irresponsible decisions, and now I might have to face some consequences"
I don’t know what everyone is worried about. I’m sure a lot of this mortgage money is insured through CMHC. Even if CMHC doesn’t have the money, they are backed up by the government. It’s not these peoples problems. It’s going to be everyone’s problem! Gotta love the socialism of our home lending system!
Guilty here, but my house is worth double than I owe on it so who cares
Exaggerated article.  There  wasn’t any magical pool  of tradespeople to do more renos  and construction than before the pandemic.
If people did renos on their own then few spent  more than 10k…more likely half of that. Not many DIYs rip out kitchens  or build additions.  They might attempt new kitchen cupboards, a new floor covering or building a deck.
If you wanted major renos in our city then could be a two year wait depending on what’s involved.  Lucky to have anyone come  out and even do an estimate.
It’s common sense. Econ 101
They want you to spend money you do not have so they can turn around and claim how well the fucking economy is making.
Lol
I'm just curious if they balanced / controlled this with SES.
There are a lot of factors that bring people into contact with police.  The largest trifecta is easily poverty, mental health, and substance use which are invariably linked together. They are further exacerbated by being disenfranchised and systemic issues in society such as racism and systemic imbalances.
We frequently see reports alleging police are biased, but I worry we focus too much on blaming police for the interactions rather than focusing on the societal ill that affected the individual and led to police contact, such as a substance use problem or being unhoused.  
It's easy to look at the stats and suggest police are racist because they interact at a disproportionate rate with individuals.  Less easy to acknowledge long standing and prevelant systemic imbalances have led those individuals to places where they are statistically more likely to interact with police at no fault of their own.
People downvoting this out of reactionary anger at the idea of discrimination are embarassing
BC has a history of corrupt police and judges. Vancouver is a hate crime capital, Prince George is a normal crime capital, cultural issues obviously play into things.
B.C. can't hog all the glory.  This is endemic across the country.
&#x200B;
There needs to be some serious restructuring of policing at the provincial and federal levels.  Until there is accountability there will never be honor or trust for police services.
[removed]
Exactly!!!! I made this exact comment and got downvoted to oblivion
>This is endemic across the country.
And many other countries. Not that that makes it any better.
Vancouver is the anti Asian hate crime capital of North America.
Why post an article you clearly didn’t even read? 
If people wanted to read a shit post they’d go to the comments section of the sun page
Guess you didn't read the article, eh?
“I can’t tell Chinese and Indigenous people apart, therefore racism isn’t real”
🤦
https://vancouversun.com/opinion/columnists/douglas-todd-do-the-numbers-really-tell-us-vancouver-is-the-anti-asian-hate-crime-capital-of-north-america
I mean, is it really?
I did.
They are saying 
“confirmed what communities had long been saying, namely that Indigenous and Black people are either grossly or significantly overrepresented in arrest incident statistics.”
Not that they are more likely to be prosecuted for the same crime or more likely to receive worse sentences for the same crime. Or that they are more likely to be innocent when arrested.
This data could happen if one race is more likely to commit crime which doesn’t indicate racism it indicates there’s something wrong.
I’m Chinese. China is huge and every province looks different physically. Indingenous came from China and Siberia so they look similar to the Mongols (who became Chinese). Saying indigenous look different would be like arguing white people in America look different than recent European immigrants.
I mean if the foreigners buying real estate were white in the narrative would we be just as upset?
Given that foreign real estate sales accounted for 2% or less of total before the tax, was it that there were a lot of sales or was it just offensive that a specific minority we’ve usually hated was doing the buying.
So where in the article do they talk about east Asians?
r/AsABlackMan
That's an entirely different argument than the one you previously made.
Indeed I’m a complicated guy 😂

It's just too damn hard for them to care about anyone else, and especially the health and well-being of the electorate. If only this were funny Beaverton, if only..
I clicked on this fully expecting to be taken to a non-parody, real news site... The absolute state of the conservative party right now.
I really appreciate solid satire and The Beaverton has produced a lot of good material. 
That piece is, however, really fucking lousy. I’m actually a bit shocked at how unfunny and unimaginative it is. Not a single *one* of them lands. 
Should this be some steppingstone gig for the author, as he or she aspires to a fulfilling career in comedic writing and beyond, well, I’m sorry to say it’s over. You’re in the wrong business.
Not to mention that it's not even how HIPAA works.
I am waiting for them to claim some type of Geneva Convention or Star Trek Prime Directive violation because they have lost complete touch with reality and with the average Canadian voter.

This is The Beaverton. This was an *easy* target for them. I thought it would be good. I not only didn’t even crack a smile, I’m baffled. How the fuck did this get past an editor?
> How the fuck did this get past an editor?
comedy's subjective, if you have a brain you should be aware that obviously its not possible to find literally every beaverton article funny
Good to see something registered with you.
I’ve never commented on a Beaverton article before. Even the worst ones typically have some redeeming quality. This one was so utterly bad, with gusts to downright infantile, I’m sincerely amazed it was published. So, so, so bad. 
It’s enough to shut the entire operation down.

> Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair announced that British Columbians from border communities can go to the U.S. for essential reasons and return without a COVID-19 PCR test. **Blair said that essential reasons include gas and food, due to gas rationing implemented by the B.C. government.**
If there is a recording of Bill Blair saying it, send the fine to him and Trudeau. There is no fucking way citizens should be paying fines for following the advice of cabinet ministers who set the fucking policy.
Then again, this is the guy who violated charter rights and has declared war on law abiding Canadians, so tough shit granny. You're not a Toronto voter, so sucks to be you.
The Big bad CBSA flexing their muscles on poor old grandma. I wonder if they those 8 other people they fined had the same story? Probably too difficult to put 2 and 2 together.
> When asked about Blair’s comments and statements from CBSA that B.C. residents affected by flood rations would be allowed to cross into the U.S., Jones said CBSA officers didn’t know what she was talking about.

> Jones, who took the fine, said she will fight it in court.
Atta girl!
This is so dumb.  The PCR test requirement should have been scrapped a long time ago anyway.
Thank you cbsa for protecting our national interests!
These fines are being cancelled. This is already old news.
the option to take the pcr test and wait 72 hours, should be: take a pcr test and enter canada within 72hrs of the results.
could have taken a few hours.
Story is DOA, fines are already being reversed, calm down rage o holics.

All of this is bullshit. You get what you vote for people. You voted for government to reduce your freedoms. Here it is.

Does that work for my now illegal shotgun?
The fines are already being reversed. Was all over the news last night.
Won’t have to. Fines are being cancelled. Was an internal miscommunication with the cbsa. Was all over the news last night.
The news is that the jackbooted CBSA doesn't know its actual purpose.
There should also be the option of simply doing a quick antibody test and if you have antibodies you should be allowed
It’s not DOA. It should have occurred to you that our government failed to communicate internally (supposedly) but instead only told the public in a casual manner. It’s complete incompetence.
Good.
On another note, should we not be examining the justification for such wildly different prices between the USA and Canada?

No. They were not told about the policy change.

I love how as soon as Rogers got the tax funded subsidy they announced their intention to borrow tons of money for this deal. We're all suckers.
We should all be against it.
We need **ALL** of Canada's political parties to strongly oppose this merger. 🛑
We all know our telcos are ripping us off and with less competition the ripping will get worse. Maybe one way to make everyone happy is to let the merger go through, but allow a couple of low cost foreign competitors in, and don't let them get bought out. Let's see how our fat telcos survive with real competition.
Former Bell Manager here.
The telecom industry has clearly indicated that they can't operate in the interest of the public. Their business is inequitable, they treat their customers and employees horribly, and raise prices without meaningful justification solely to the benefit of their major shareholders.
Corruption, exploitation, and monopolization are the results of this market. We do not create the best prices nor the best quality by allowing the big 3 telecoms to, "compete," with one another while their regulating body the CRTC is headed by former executives of the telecoms.
I doubt the competition strategy would be successful, because they seem more than willing to merge, absorb, and crush any competition that appears.
If they need public contracts, public subsidies and public funding to succeed then they should be a public company. I wish there was a clear path to just nationalize them because they have failed as private industries.
As is anyone in possession of a single ethic.
Let them merge.  Just don't let them own the physical infrastructure.   Make them rent it from the government, like they do with other ISP's.   Private industry should not own the infrastructure required to run this country/our lives.
Yes less competition will drive up prices for Canadians who currently pay the highest data rates on the planet. This is a terrible idea.
Good.  Everybody **regardless of political standing** should be against this merger.  This is basically Palpatine going "I AM THE SENATE".
Why have a merger yet keep out any competition?!
I don’t know how you can be alive in 2021 and think Canada needs more centralized control over media.
Let’s open the door to competition!    We protect these companies and it costs taxpayers a fortune!  We alway seem to send the government (with short pants) to negotiate with private business (with long pants).  We can’t win!
Be a lot cooler if he said he'd nationalize it.
Our telecom sector is so incestuous they might as well rebrand as the Habsburgs.

Worked for a call center that fielded customer calls for Shaw during this year. I was in their customer service department for six months before I burnt out and just started giving out credits like a motherfucker in my last week. The call centre company was fucking awful to work for and Shaws policies pretty much outline how they do not give a flying fuck about their customers. People with 50 year old accounts looking for help and 9/10 times I couldn’t do anything and would then get yelled at for five minutes and good luck finding a supervisor to escalate calls when you’re working from home and posting in a chat room… I couldn’t handle being Shaws middle man/punching bag, being the person who gets to tell the customer ‘fuck you we don’t care’ and then have to take the mental brunt of that persons frustration. People would ask about the merge we were instructed to not discuss it and direct them to the website.
Canada should have nothing to do with this propaganda charade. “Look how nice and normal we are world”.
This is Berlin in 1936 all over again. Send a message now. Don’t legitimize their bullshit by doing exactly what they want and having our public broadcaster talking about how amazing their ceremonies and unique culture is. Screw that. 
Sucks for the athletes but this is bigger than sport.
Fuck the Olympics and fuck anyone who attends, especially this year.
Love the look of the third jersey. Hate where it is being worn.
Why do they look like the uniforms of the antagonist team from a kids hockey movie?
The black jersey is killer 💯
I like it. Looks modern.
Can’t wait to see Canada win another gold
Nice Huawei logo….
That black one looks evil.
Makes sense.
What Olympics? I will not support any company that supports games in Fascist China.
Boycott Beijing 2022
Why are they going to Beijing at all?
Canada x Huawei collab. Looks like shit
Better than the ugly ass Lululemon outfits. 
That being said, having some patches that say free Taiwan, or something would be even better.
Some of you should cry more. The ONLY way they're not going is due to a Covid outbreak and the NHL//NHLPA stop them. There's not, going, to, be, a, boycott.
While completely unrealistic at this point, there should be another or alternative Olympics held in Taiwan.
Those are great looking jerseys.
Really nice uniform
They should have 'Remember the Two Michaels' crests on the shoulders.
Not sure the Government sanctioned kidnapping risk is worth it.

What is the vaccine % for indigenous people? They don’t seem to be getting the same grief for being antivax.
Lmao imagine being so emotionally triggered by someone else’s medical choices
I'd get the hell out too ahead of that if I was up there.
well time to upgrade to one that took science and biology .
Well, i hope they realize that they will not be allowed to travel anywhere without the vaccination. 
That they realize they cannot go out to restaurants or ay gathering without vaccinations. 
That they  realize they will not be able to get a teaching job in most jurisdictions without getting vaccinations.
That they realize there are many restrictions against those that are not vaccinated.
That they realize they will not get any sympathy form almost 95% of all Canadians.
I guess they weren't terribly intelligent educators.
Better off.
Because, as literally evidenced in the other reply to you, the natives and indigenous can do no wrong.
I give indigenous people more of a break when it comes to trusting the government about stuff. Hasn't always worked out well for them.
It's their own choice. If there was a mandate for my job that goes against my beliefs then yeah I'd rather choose to resign.
Why people have to chime in and give their own negative opinion about people silently resigning? I don't know, but it just goes to show there is a pro-vax mob out there that clearly thinks peoples personal opinions don't matter because they are backed by medical facts.
I prefer to support people who make their own choices instead of being controlled by others ideals.
That probably remains to be seen. I doubt that teachers who are willing to work in Nunavut are in abundant supply.
No, all governments on the planet did not lie to them.
Doesn't everyone have a beef with "the government"?
As an aboriginal person, 110% of my issues with the vaccine were based off the distrust of government. 
Sad to say but the one thing that confirmed that it was the right move was the amount of professional athletes who got the jab. They actually have access to world class doctors and have the funds to get second, third, forth opinions etc. 
If the NFL had a low vaccination rate I’d probably still be holding out.
I don't get the downvotes.  It's the same with black people the in US.  It's almost as if long term distrust, ill-will and inequality makes people less likely to take the government at their word.
Every other thing about first Nations health isn't a priority - down to drinking water.  It's amazing they aren't willing to adopt the vaccine as quickly as the rest of us.
So you're saying the indigenous are right and we all shouldn't get vaccinated ?
It's not even backed by medical facts. Vaccine rollout takes 5+ years. We're still working on the facts.
[removed]
Similar issues here in the NWT. For a bunch of them it wasn't even anything to do with vaccination, it was travel restrictions that had people leave to be closer to family. 
For well over a year you basically couldn't leave as you'd need to quarantine for 14 days on return, which for many meant losing two weeks of pay. That was hard for folk who's support networks/family were down south.
- US cancels a pipeline from Canada.
- US turns around and begs OPEC to produce more oil.
- OPEC disagrees.
- US begs India, China, UK, South Korea, and Japan to release more strategic reserve alongside the US.
- OPEC vows to retaliate.
- US proposes banning export of US oil as a means to lower prices, gets told it would lead to shut ins and increased prices.
The whole debacle is insane but apparently the US would prefer dealing with the world’s Bond villains rather than its neighbour and ally.
>Pipeline giant TC Energy is formally seeking compensation from the U.S. government for the cancellation of the cross-border Keystone XL expansion project.  
>  
>The Calgary-based company has officially filed a request for arbitration in its bid for “economic damages” resulting from President Joe Biden’s decision to cancel the project.
Good luck TC
Too bad TC doesn’t move water; they’d have leverage.
Was cancelling the project a violation of trade agreements between Canada and the US? There has been mention of this lawsuit but no mention of which grounds they are using as the basis for the lawsuit itself. I had assumed it was NAFTA related or whatever it’s called now but no news outlet seems to elaborate further.
What are the chances TC would reimburse the Alberta government if they do get any money from the US?
Good comment. Thank you for this brief summarization of the important ideas.
>The whole debacle is insane but apparently the US would prefer dealing with the world’s Bond villains rather than its neighbour and ally.
From the day he was elected Biden has been anti Canada.  He has proposed and enacted multiple policies that are direct attacks on the Canadian economy and trade with the US.
That is a total perversion of reality. This isn’t just a US issue. 
1) This pipeline has nothing to do with current capacity. Besides the fact that it would not be contributing yet, it was simply replacing what is currently transported by rail and road. 
2) The US didn’t beg OPEC any more than anyone else - the entire world is struggling with high energy costs. Asking to increase production is nothing but a publicity stunt because it’s well known, ie Rystad Energy, that OPEC is struggling to even meet their own current targets. 
3) No one is begging anyone to release oil from reserves - every single country you listed was already discussing it, and the US wanted to coordinate a release. High energy costs are the single largest contributor to high inflation in all parts of the globe - so idk why you’re trying to pretend like this is a US issue. 
4) OPEC says a lot of things, but there’s not much they can do to retaliate given that their own members have already been unable to meet their own production targets since they began increasing output by 400k per month in August. They grossly overstate their excess capacity, and SA is the worst offender. 
5) The US never proposed banning oil exports, so idk what hole you pulled that out of. They don’t propose things like that - they’d just do it. The US banned oil exports for most of your life, and could easily do it again if they wanted to without hurting domestic prices. It would just hurt others and the whole market for a variety of reasons, which is why they wouldn’t do it and have no need to do it. But again, **it was never “proposed” as you claim.**
6) US oil production is far higher than Canada’s. In fact they’re the largest oil producer in the world right now, and they are a net exporter. They don’t need more oil - the whole world needs more oil. Oil markets are global.
Laughs in softwood lumber industry
25% of North America's natural gas transmission ain't enough leverage?
The merit is that they are not treating KXL the same as other pipelines in the US. For example, they claimed that KXL was not in the national interest, yet allowed 10x that length of pipelines and capacity to be built in the same time period. 
In terms of its safety in comparison to other pipelines, Obama's State Department recommended for KXL to proceed back in 2011 with a number of conditions, and reiterated its recommendation in 2014. In theory, this shows that KXL isn't any different to the other pipelines in terms of risk or anything like that, but yet was treated extremely differently.
By this argument, pipelines were in the national interest of the US and KXL was no different than any other US pipeline, meaning that TC Energy was treated differently than other pipeline companies just because of the border crossing and is illegal under NAFTA.
National treatment. The argument is that it's cancelled while other major pipeline projects are going ahead in the US because KXL is a Canadian pipeline. That's a direct violation of the trade agreement.
Even if it was a violation, Canada is a satellite, so it doesn’t matter. Trudeau’s pointless meeting with Biden recently reiterated this.
You mean he revoked construction permits for two pipelines that were blocked a decade ago by Obama, reinstated by Trump and but held up in court, and then never actually acted upon?
This is the best example. The US fucks us whenever and wherever they want, repeatedly.  See softwood lumber.
Not according to the Biden administration. Have a cozy winter y’all!
The US is a net exporter of both natural gas and oil
Meeting seemed pointless. Regardless I was questioning the merit of the lawsuit rather than principle of it.
They don’t need Nat gas. Electricity comes from the wall! Use an electric heater. It’s a trick oil and gas doesn’t want you to know.

How about reading the article.  It's not a supply chain issue.
people are out there pretending they're in FernGully or something...
Blockading. [Taking](https://mobile.twitter.com/Likhtsamisyu/status/1450125563721441292) CGL heavy equipment and using it for such, including picking up/crushing cars (which I assume were not theirs) in order to build barriers. There's been talk about sabotage as well but I've not seen evidence of that, but some of the groups involved have happily posted videos of themselves tearing shit up with the CAT.
This [article](https://breachmedia.ca/on-the-war-trail-with-the-wetsuweten/) also describes various actions and escalations on both sides

At this point the delays cost 400million - just pay the grifters and move on jeez
I can't imagine another infrastructure project like this ever starting in BC given the federal/provincial government is completely cool with extortion but I guess this is why Canada struggles to get anything done.
Duh.
It might not be noble, but we wouldn't be discussing the pipeline if they just packed up and went home. Desperate times, desperate measures...
And before you downvote me, I don't agree with everything the protestors did, and I definately don't think the RCMP should have brought snipers to the party. Bad moves all around.
Friendly reminder that we now know that fossil fuel should be left in the ground forever.
> just pay the grifters and move on
The problem with that is the grifters don't stay bought, and constantly want more, because we keep giving them more.
So your kids and wife to agree to me dumping garbage in the yard of the house that you own. You’re okay with this right? Because i negotiated with the majority of the residents if your house, right?
I understand your point but remember that if you need to resort to hostage taking or violence for people to start "discussing"  your message then perhaps it's on you sit down and seriously reflect on why that is. The problem isnt the other people, it's the message.
Edit: I could have worded my comment better, when I say you I dont mean you personally, sorry.
Ok, bury your phone then and stop spamming this forum.
It's funny as indigenous communities are very reliant on fossil fuel because of how remote they are. Diesel generators, big pickup trucks, air transported food.
We know what this is realy  about $$$
This is the issue. You paid off the elected chiefs.... oh but did you pay off the hereditary chiefs?
I agree.  Once violence is used or threatened, whatever message or point you are trying to get out there is generally lost. There does come a point though for some when they feel they have nothing to lose. I am afraid we will see more and more of this.
BC is literally in climate disaster and you’re worried about how protesters, who aren’t going anywhere as things get worse, aren’t being civil enough?
Why do you expect civility in historic disorder? The corporations enabling the destruction of my province aren’t civil just because they follow the law. The law is murdering my future. 
How do you expect civility to prevail here? 
Too many Canadians wishful think their sense away hoping for no arguments no surprises. Let’s watch and see if civility is on the horizon as environmental protesters are demonized like Vancouver wasn’t just cut off from confederation and like a town isn’t going to disappear every summer and like there’s never going to be a spill from our unregulated oil projects. 
The jobs are important because the industry deems them to be and people can’t opt out from the economy. That’s irrelevant to how the economy ultimately suffers from more extraction.
Hurr Durr it simply can’t be true that my world is unethical 
We live on the same planet genius nobody can opt out from this it doesn’t make it right
> stop spamming this forum
No.
Indigenous communities don't pump their own. Batteries aren't without environmental issues, but everybody's most urgent issue being climate change, solar, wind and batteries shall prove an improvement over generators.
Remote communities emit more pollution full stop.  There is no public transportation. There is no natural gas heating so its oil or electrical....etc
What a misleading article.
No, developers can't build on the habitats of at risk species then just donate money later.
I reread the article. Could you quote from the article where it says "developers can build on the habitats of at risk species then just donate money later." I wasn't able to find that claim.
Yeah, they have to donate first.
That's absolutely what it is suggesting
>essentially facilitating development rather than protecting species at risk
>One of the new provisions allowed developers to contribute cash to protect habitat across the province, rather than mitigating environmental damage caused by their own building projects. Environmentalist critics labelled the idea “pay-to-slay.”
Right there
pay to slay..... LOL   fucking ridiculous
The author of this article is being purposfully misleading.
He said 'can't'
Thank you for the clarification. Earlier, the point you were making wasn't clear to me. No doubt due to my inadequacies.

Take it easy bruh
Exactly.
Billions in tax shelters = ok
You made a quick gain in TFSA = illegal
But it's a tax free savings account.
CRA - well yes but no
This bothered me when I first read it (CRA first mentioned this in spring 2020) because there’s no rules established. I don’t do day trading but if CRA don’t want people doing shit like shorting gamestop from a tfsa then make some rules up. Right now it’s this grey area.
>There are no defined limits on trading in a TFSA.
Ain't that just grand.
This is for day traders.
We can only put in 6k a year. If people manage to trade their way to huge wealth on that then good for them.
You can invest your money in TFSA.
"hEY, NOt LIkE THaT!" -CRA
Like... just give us one fucking break, we get taxed to travel, on buying, on working, on property where we simply live. After we've paid all that off and have been taxed and bled out we have just that one bit left...
   ..that one bit of success we finally get to put somewhere and be proud of and watch grow. And sometimes we wanna risk our own money and make some trades and get some gains.. You want a fucking piece of that too.
a big whopping... FOR FUCKS SAKE
There's always a catch for the little people
Unless they can prove you are using tfsa money to pay bills how can the cra claim "business income". 
If someone is trading for retirement and never takes money out it would be pretty hard for the Cra to take you to court over this.
These warnings are for people day trading and pulling money out monthly to pay their bills thinking they will avoid paying income tax.
"Wow, you bought a meme stock, couldn't handle the stress and sold it for a small profit a couple hours later and then bought your usual ETFs. SOMETHING FISHY GOING ON HERE!"
CRA has been making this threat for many years, it's the same conversation every time. It never amounts to anything though.
The penumbra (grey area) is a good thing. Having set definitions only accomplishes restrictions.  I'd rather it be open to interpretation vs having a set outline.  This is where the wealthy gain more wealth....in the grey areas.  I'm not saying that they use TFSA's but instead the fact that certain laws are written in very certain ways so that they are grey and so it's open to interpretation.
It's total BS.  
CRA needs to have a better definition than "we know it when we see it" and veiled threats.  
US has an actual definition of pattern day trader, but the CRA prefers it to be vague to suit its own needs.
There are no defined limits on trading but there are defined limits on certain activities.
The defined limit is that average slobs like us aren't allowed to make money on investment. Only Shaw and Rogers, the big banks, and major real estate companies.
And the CRA gets to privately define what day trading means, and won't tell you unless you've gone above their invisible limit.
Hey, I just wanted to comment, with respect, that you can make trades here and there within your tfsa but if you are day trading you will get nicked.  I’ve spoken with a number of accountants and they all seem to say that if you are making less then 5 trades a month you ‘should’ be ok.  It sucks that they don’t have any defined limits so the picture is vague but also be sure that you have the correct types of stocks in there because of you are holding ‘pinks’ in there you’ll get nicked 15% I believe.  I have no problem with the tfsa being structured the way it is but the details or guidelines that are lacking to absolutely advise what is allowed is a double edged sword.  One edge is uncertainty vs the other edge being able to do what you want (to an extent) subject to rev can scrutiny.  Frankly if you are trading in that account and you leave the money in there I don’t see how this can be viewed as anything but retirement savings but then again I’m not rev can.
Don’t forget inflation rates partially controlled by the government which takes away the value of savings that we have. Or when they devalue our money by printing more, then spending the printed money, sort of like being taxed again.
How does using a TFSA to 'pay bills' imply business income and how would doing so even it it was a business, avoid tax?
It's the fact that they have to "check and see" inorder to know if.
Awesome! Isn't meth pretty easy to manufacture though? Or is that just on TV?
Thats what i call sourdough!
We can't get plastic toothpicks from China, but we're shipping meth to Aussies?
The real story is how much stuff they miss. It's extremely safe and easy to import drugs via mail from a non hotspot like the Netherlands.
> The news of the probe comes entirely from Australian authorities. Neither the RCMP nor CBSA have said anything about their involvement in the probe.
Of course. Big problem with transparency here.
Hey, gotta' replace that oil'n'gas revenue somehow.
Trudeau is trying to help the economy by exporting Canada's finest meth.
Yes, it is. The days of using ephedrine meth are at a close. I forget the new process now but it's gotten to the point authorities really can't do much to quash it(from an ingredient availability context).
I'm surprised crime orgs up here see meth manufacture worth the costs compared to Mexico cook places. They're not even houses now there are warehouses down there devoted to it.
> Authorities estimated the meth, if broken down and sold in individual street-level deals, was worth more than AUS$88 million. That’s about $81 million in Canadian dollars. Methamphetamine is also known by several street names, including crystal meth and ice.
Interesting today's seizure reports are more verbose and broken down. Articles used to mention street value only which exaggerates the value.
Probably hard to get the precursors into Australia.
I recently saw a Locked Up Abroad episode where a swimsuit model (Simone Farrow) was able to buy meth at low prices in LA and mail it to Sydney to a middleman for a large profit.
If not us the north koreans supply them (seriously they’re a narco state and the aussies are their main market)
David Suzuki enters the chat…
Kim Jong Un did it, so why not someone else?
What I don’t understand is how it’s even profitable to do so. Meth is cheap in Canada, between 40-60 bucks a gram based on quality and location. Meth also lasts for a LONG time. Like if you do a line of 0.3 grams of meth, that’s significant and you’ll be awake for a solid 2 days if you don’t have a tolerance. 
I never had much of a meth problem, just sort of wandered into it on my way out of a cocaine addiction, but I NEVER finished a bag of meth. By day 2 or 3, the chemical feeling in my head and throat, and the feeling of unwell ness from having only consumed meth and a half litre of water for up to 72 hours has me so ready to just get off the shit already, and I never spent more than 50-60 bucks at a time. And it was a significant ish amount going in the toilet (also don’t flush drugs pls)
Cocaine, me and the boys would burn through 1500-3 grand in a weekend EASY.
Found Jesse Pinkman’s account.
Cocaine is a hell of a drug.
True, in my experience more habit forming than meth, but it also costs almost twice as much. 100 bucks a gram is the basic standard everywhere, 60 a gram is normal but you’re not really getting a gram in those cases. 
Meth seems to really mess people up so I’m glad I never found out why i guess

No PCR test required!  That’s only for citizens and legal residents of Canada!
Article Highlights:
* On Sunday, Radio-Canada, CBC’s French arm, reported that the illegal border crossing had been reopened along with the rest of the border.
* Now, don’t expect those showing up to have to show a negative PCR test as proof they’re  COVID-free.
* They are fleeing the beautiful Lake Champlain region that touches on the borders of Quebec, New York, and Vermont.
* If you’ve never been to the area, this is the type of place most people flee to, not from. Which has always been my problem with the fake refugee/asylum seeker industry that popped up around the region, starting in 2017.
* People  literally fly into JFK airport in New York, get directed to the easiest bus route to Plattburgh, N.Y., and then hire a cab that drops them at the illegal border crossing.
* For activists who insist it’s wrong to call it an illegal border crossing, it’s simply an irregular crossing.  Yet, the signs posted by the federal government clearly state that it is illegal to cross there. The verbal warnings given by the RCMP to those looking to cross, tell them that it is illegal to do so, and once people do cross, the Mounties arrest them.
* We will have to wait and see how many of those people choose to try to come to Canada, but it’s clear the Trudeau government has given them another route — one outside the normal and legal channels.
Not enough Canadians willing to work for non-sustainable wages and zero benefits. 
Why have some limit on foreign workers and encourage industry and corporate Canada to pay Canadian workers what they are worth, when you can more easily sit back, relax and listen to Corporate Canada dictate Canadian immigration policies.
Hold on, are you telling me that border crossing can be closed or opened at will?
lmao - banana monarchy
Come one, come all.  Free accommodation, cash for food, express lane to PR or citizenship.   No difficult questions at the border.
Crossing illegally at Roxham Road is fast track to immigration. Our government sadly rewards those who disregard the rules. Effectively, most of these future Canadians are economic migrants. They are skipping the immigration queue without any effort to prove their identity, education status, screening for criminal record, bank statement. No application fees or wait times. No interview at a consulate. Walk right in.
I have trouble trusting inspiring citizens who’s very first act in Canada is to break the law.
"illegal border crossing reopened" - Now that's a 2021 headline.
They even carry your bags for you!

Also Ontario
> Presenting ISIS in bad light - as Nadia Murad did in her book - is Islamophobic
Ontario is fucked beyond recognition.
**This is ridiculous.**
It is not because Ontario does not understand the values upon which the Quebec society is built, that are different from Ontario's, that it can claim (wrongfully) that it is Islamophobia.
**Truth is that Quebec's Bill 21 is precisely the right thing to do**
What Bill 21 achieves is to flatten differences between different people so **what they have in common dominates** over what separates them.
Quebec shows how to build a coherent society where everyone focuses on what unites them while differences are still being expressed in private.
**Canada already has laws that do the same thing as Bill 21**
Think about the Nudists, those people who enjoy spending time naked in groups. It is what the practitioners call "Nudist culture", many of them elevating the experience to the level of a spiritual experience similar to a religion.

**How is that not Nudistophobia???**
Well that law on public nudity, although it infringes on the right of the nudists to practice their culture in public, is seen as a necessary law that fosters a society where everyone feels at ease.
How is Bill 21 any different? It is not once you understand the concept of "Laicité".
**How does Quebec practice Laicité?**
First, Quebec started by **purging the Catholic Church from politics**, from the public space. Back in the 1960's, the Church was everywhere and Quebec decided that the Clergy was no longer important.
So, after pushing the Catholic and Protestant Clergies out of the way, Quebec only applies the same logic to other religions who have not yet gotten the message that the **State of Quebec is completely and entirely secular.**
**So if Bill 21 is Islamophobe, then Quebec in its entirety is Christianophobe...**
If Quebec rejects all religions equally, then is it possible that Bill 21 is not Islamophobe but simply **Religionophobe?**
**Yes Quebec rejects all religions equally and that is the right thing to do.**
Practice your culture or religion in private and **celebrate** what you have in common with everyone else in public.
*Translation by Google Translate. {} indicate corrections by me*
**The Legault government is outraged that Bill 21 is presented as a "clear example of Islamophobia" in a capsule paid for by the Ontario Ministry of Education and intended for schools in that province.**
“[Since September 11, 2001] Muslims have been subject to increased control and marginalization due to overly Islamophobic laws. One of the most obvious current examples is the law on secularism in Quebec."
This can be heard in a video produced by the Muslim Association of Canada for the Ontario Ministry of Education. The latter invested $ 225,000 for capsules like these to be used in the fight against Islamophobia in schools across the province of Canada.
According to the video's narrator, the law's ban on religious symbols for some government employees, including teachers, imposes "a 'troubling choice' on Muslim women."
"It undermines dignity and it goes against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights," we can hear.
**Insult towards the nation**
Called to react, the cabinet of Simon Jolin-Barrette, Minister of Justice and Minister responsible for Secularism, deemed "completely unacceptable" this reference to Law 21.
"It is an insult to the Quebec nation and its democracy, but also to all the other states of law in the world which have chosen secularism. Ontario must change its mind. "
"Quebec has adopted a mode of organization of relations between the State and religions that reflects its historical path and its distinct social values," added the cabinet, arguing that this was based on principles such as equality between citizens and freedom of conscience.
**Ontario defends itself**
For its part, the Ontario Ministry of Education told the Journal that these video clips are not part of the compulsory subject to be taught in its schools.
"The resources are dedicated to supporting teachers with resources in the classroom," wrote spokesperson Monica Ahmed, noting that these are aimed at students as well as parents and teachers.
The ministry also refused to endorse the content of the capsules, even if it funded them.
"While the ministry values ​​its work with community organizations, the views expressed in any publication related to a project do not necessarily reflect those of the province and the government of Ontario," Ahmed wrote.
The Ontario government announced the move last June, less than a month after the Islamophobic terror attack in London, in which a man killed four members of a single Muslim family while driving a van. The Legault government then denounced the “ignoble” amalgamations of journalists and columnists from English Canada, who made links between this attack and Law 21.
**Information campaign requested**
The Rassemblement pour laïcité (RPL), for its part, argues that the point of view expressed in the video reflects {ignorance towards Quebec.}
"They are saying that the majority of Quebecers are hateful, are Islamophobic," said Nadia El-Mabrouk, member of the board of directors. It is time for the Quebec government to launch a rigorous information campaign on secularism, because Quebec is being demonized. "

Oh hey it’s another bill 21 thread 
[Ah shit, here we go again.

commence the inter-provincial bickering
Good?
Québec should only ban Muslim woman who were abused by Islamic terrorist. Only then could it be as virtuous as and pure as  the Anglos.
Good for them for calling it out. That ship's needlessly discriminatory and Quebec should be ashamed. 10 or 20 years ago if someone proposed this shit the left would take to the streets, and but now we waive it like it's some kind of victory flag?
It is racism, and we really need to stop pretending that it's mere "secularism".
[deleted]
I love it when conservatives' argument is just stating facts and getting outraged.
People in Ontario expressing the overwhelming consensus of civil society across Canada outside Quebec? What's next? Non-Americans daring to say the U.S. isn't the greatest country on earth?
When your definition of "fundamentalism" encompasses any Jewish man who wears a kippah, you've found yourself a definition so broad as to be totally meaningless.
Secularism is a leftist concept. You just dont understand it.
Would you consider Afghanistan Christianophobe? As it isn’t uncommon do kill Christians and Jews while defacing their places of worship. 
And yet it’s part of a culture and made to be more understood through their history, and scars.
Now let’s apply that same mindset to France and by en tension French Canadians. This is a secular move not intended to impact any one specific religion, instead looking to be as visually neutral to any observer. Not to mention that in French culture, separation of church and state had been paramount to any government.
It is not racism.
They are saying it isn’t because it applies to all religions equally, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh, Christians, Scientologists. 
Separation of church and state is baked into French culture, if anything it’s religionist, because it isn’t specific at all to muslims
I remember when being opposed to religious interference with the state wasn't considered conservative.
We know more about the corporate structure of this Catholic order than we do about the corporate structure of the Bank of Canada.
Bank of Canada Act. There, now you have access to what there is to know about their structure.
Exactly. So what is the **actual de facto** chain of corporate authority at the BoC that allows them to flagrantly disregard the Bank of Canada Act and their current five-year mandate?
That's gotta be a new record for quickest derailment of a thread

Good. It was nothing but pure fear mongering anyways. About time the rest of the provinces do the same, as well as stop reporting daily the useless number of asymptomatic cases among fully vaccinated people, which the irresponsible media use for nothing but daily doom scrolling and fear mongering.
I am a flight attendant (16 years seniority) and among all of my colleagues/flight attendants/pilots who continued to work flights throughout the pandemic (including myself) I know of 5 people who had covid since March 2020. 
1 of the cases the person tested positive without symptoms and only found out by fluke (fully vaxxed). All the other cases were in 2020 and early 2021 before vaccines were out. Even so, none of them can confidently say if they caught it due to exposure during the flight. 
If covid were easily spread aboard aircrafts is it not logical that the numbers of sick crew members be much higher? Can we not make this conclusion after nearly 2 years?
Can someone explain the logic behind this? You'd almost think knowing if you were potentially exposed to covid would be a good idea
It does make sense. If you are vaccinated and exposed on a plane, it's not like you would do anything differently. And since everyone has to be vaccinated now to fly, this information is useless.
Makes sense, it's time to stop the fear mongering and let people get on with their lives. You already need to be fully vaccinated to fly on a plane anyways, which reduces the serious symptoms and with the reduced symptoms also reduces your chances of potentially spreading it if you are fully vaccinated.
This virus is going to be around for a very long time, if not forever. It's time people realize and understand that and adjust their risk levels accordingly. Don't like it? Don't fly. Isn't that what people (myself included) said when people who refused the vaccine complained about the vaccination requirement for planes? Well I'll say the same thing here for those who are vaccinated. 
I'm also curious about what the general thoughts will be on this, especially considering it's coming from BC. I always notice a massive difference on comments for things like this when it comes from BC vs say AB, SK or ON.
Probably for the best anyway TBH, as we know you've got to be vaccinated to travel in the air anyway. I'd dare say it's best not to perpetuate the theory of breakthrough infections and cast doubt upon the shielding of the vaccine.
So having less information is better to you? How people use that information is outside of our control.
On the other hand, having that information is helpful because it gives the public an insight into when we can push for an end to masking and make better decisions when it comes to our personal health. We’re worse off with less data.
Lol you do have a compelling argument. Even though its anecdotal, shldve had a lot more colleagues sick with covid if it spread so easily on flights. Maybe all ur colleagues just have super immunity who knows.
Some time ago I read some comments from a steward who was HIV positive, expressing concern that he might catch covid from one of his passengers. Yet 30-40 years ago when newspapers described AIDS as the gay plague, it is the passengers who would have been terrified to be served by him. To gain some perspective on what is happening today, it is well worth looking back to pre-covid writing about that era. It reminds  us that what is being written and said and "known" about covid today is unlikely to endure.
https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.83.10.1477
https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/11/30/world-aids-day-1980s-headlines-tabloids/
The logic is that we're all exposed sooner or later. Do you get notified if someone had the flu? We'll have to live with COVID among us for the rest of our lives.
Most are vaccinated and have a high chance of symptoms being mild. Any kind of "return to normal" will only happen when media, government and companies start toning down the drama.
Time to move on, do you care if you were exposed to any other disease? It's over, time to normalize Covid as something we have to live with and move on. If you are fully vaccinated and still scared, stay locked in your basement like a chicken afraid of your own shadow. Otherwise, get over it.
I imagine it is just cost and manpower. There were people in charge of contact tracing and case reports, they can now be freed up to do other things. I know for one they are short on the help lines
It really wasn't helpful in practice. For example, I was keeping an eye on it after flying back to see my parents. The exposures on flights for the day I flew weren't updated on the website until several days after I traveled (like maybe 5 days?), when I already would have been quite infectious.
IDK, I might think twice about going to that hot yoga class or party if I knew I’d been exposed to covid recently.  
Maybe I’m just weird like that though.
Other then go get tested of course.  Being vaccinated does not stop you from getting covid.
Breakthrough infections are regularly reported by health authorities, e.g. yesterday in BC:
Past week cases (Nov. 12-18) – Total 2,845
    Not vaccinated: 1,580 (55.5%)
    Partially vaccinated: 123 (4.3%)
    Fully vaccinated: 1,142 (40.1%)

But their precious ad revenue
....that's called logic?
Banks are a giant bag of dicks these days.  That's what limited competition does.  Time to reform.
If only more people knew banks are just sales machines. I took over my mother's finances recently so went to the bank to talk to her advisor. Once he realized I understood banking, investment products, low cost investing, the difference between a mutual fund and ETF and all the rest of it, he looked at me so sheepishly and embarrassed. The scam was up.
There needs to be a law that whenever someone seeks a professional for financial advice, they must immediately disclose whether or not they have a fiduciary responsibility in plain language and what that means. 
The reality is most Canadians have no idea about personal finance and investing. It's to be expected people will go to their bank trusting they will get advice specifically in their best interest when, in reality, it's a total setup and they've walked into a trap.
> The issue of banks removing third-party funds from their product shelves erupted earlier this year when Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce notified clients in their financial planning businesses that advisers will no longer sell third-party funds for any investment portfolios. **(The changes do not apply to any of the banks’ full-service brokerage accounts or do-it-yourself investing clients.)**
PSA: All the big banks offer do-it-yourself brokerage accounts where you can get access to all the same investment funds, without paying any fees to their ~~financial advisors~~ mutual funds salespeople. So even if you're happy with just whatever funds the "advisor" at the bank offers you, you can *still* save money by opening a brokerage account instead and buying the same funds. Plus, you get access to investment funds from all the other competitors, and ETFs, stocks, etc.
when major banks push advisors to transfer in 3rd party funds and on the other hand prevent subsequent purchases of the transfered in  funds and even worse, dont even unlock the system or have a procedure in place to make subsequent purchases, you wonder where is the flexibility and the benefit for a client to transfer assets
The goal is to swith for in house funds in order to have your numbers   
 (sales)  recorded  on  your sale objectives  bonus at the end of the year depends on that
So yes you will get a call for a review of your investment.  and yes the advisor will suggest that  it s time to rebalance your funds and for sure you will be advise   to swith over to the firm s products.  and yes you will fell that your advisor is taking good care of you since you will get a call as soon as one of your 3rd party funds is going off the deffered fee schedule  
Only then, the advisors see it accounted for as new investments sale toward there sale objectives. There job and bonus depends on that.  
And for retention, you will be  offered to switch to a new funds with lower MER (management expense ratio) and they will prove you out of no doubt that you will be better off with a DSC funds, since you would be less entiltled to move away your funds in the future as you would have to pay fee for the next 5 years...  and then you will hear, you know it s for the longer term so no worries about defered sales charges. RETENTION RETENTION  and then you Wont receive call from your advisors as frequently as before since your are no longer a prospect for future sales.
There is an abundance of competition in the investment industry. An utter abundance.
Yes, bank employees make it seem like they're "advisors" with a fiduciary duty, while in reality, most are little more than salespeople for their specific employer. Which could be okay as long as they're clear and open about it.
Exactly! 
That said, you'll be surprised how many people lack the knowledge and the fortitude to invest their whole retirement account by themselves. 
You get that you pay for..
..ummm, there's limited number of banks.
I'm not sure if this is sarcastic but there most definitely isn't. 80% of investment products in Canada are sold through the five banks.
You can invest so many places other than a bank. It is like mortgages. You don't need to get a mortgage from a bank.
Because that is what customers are choosing. There are a plethora of options ranging from scammy investment advisors to specialty advisors to brokerages to roboadvisors.
Nope, because that is what they are limited to. Reputable companies like Fidelity are forced to go through the banks because that's where Canadians go to invest. 
This isn't about some millennial in downtown Toronto buying ETFs on Wealthsimple. This is the farmer in SK investing for a new tractor or the grandma in PEI saving for retirement.
Apart from the many legal and regulatory advantages that specifically protect and advantage the five Canadiab banks, against entrants like WS or foreign banks.
This is just not true.. there is plenty of options available for anybody that willing to put in the effort to find something outside of the big five banks. The Canadians seems to like keeping their funds at the big five banks, despite all bitching we do about it. Wealth simple is just a platform to buy securities. You have same option available via banks. In fact apples to apples even in that arena the banks have way larger piece of the pie.
Also did you see how stable the Canadian banks were during the 2008 financial crisis. Despite the rants and raves they’re prudent asset allocators. It’s not by mistake that non of them have cut a dividend in 150 years.
National Bank Direct Brokerage is offering 0 comission trades atm, they also have ten times the features of WS, as well as being a traditional bank.

Felt nothing but empathy for her at first and wondered why should be further punished with the charge…and then I read that she was .06 blood / alcohol—*after*—floating down a freezing river and getting to a hospital. She must have been smashed getting in the vehicle.
Man, this seems like a disheartening use of our legal system.  Let's all pile on our tax dollars to make sure this woman never recovers!/s  Surely there are greater wrongdoings out there to correct than someone losing their grip on their child in extreme circumstances.  You can point to whatever excuse (i.e. alcohol, theraputic drug use) as explanations for how, but is dolling out extra punishment for that really what we want to do as a society, knowing full well the punishment of living with the knowledge and failure will follow her for life already?  I see shit like this, and on the other hand corporate malfeasance going unpunished or rewarded, and I ask myself why am I paying for this system?
Even if she hadn't, driving into that situation would be negligence resulting in an infant's death. Some form of punishment was always going to be warranted.
After losing her son, no judge would *ever* impose a lifelong criminal record for culpable homicide for simply “crossing a barrier.”
Since she was never charged with Murder, you're right, she wouldn't get a criminal record for that.
Instead she will have a lifelong criminal record for Criminal Negligence Causing Death.
I must be missing something…I feel like I’m speaking a different language here.
It’s called the law. The exact legalese can get complex.
This was mostly due to poor flood and slide management. The rainfall that messed everything up is in the realm of a 50 year event or so, completely reasonable for it to happen even if climate change doesn’t exist (not saying it doesn’t!). Obviously these sorts of things may happen more frequently in the future.
We’ve refused to spend the necessary funds to be prepared for these sorts of things and we’re paying for it big time now. This is an infrastructural failure.
They built over a drained lake and also diverted the river. Pump station failed. City officials warned about it in 2013. Climate change is responsible?
I'm massively irritated that the media is completely ignoring why that shit happened...
Just like with the forest fires.
Yes  climate change absolutely played a roll....  but our lack of forest management is in my opinion the largest factor by a long shot.
Clearcutting next to a fucking floodplain so that there's nothing left to soak ip and hold back the water...  HELLO?
> The costs of ignoring the warnings will be enormous
You mean there won't be any money for feelings?
Lol bet our generation has to buy affordable homes in the “unfavourable climate event” zones
For anyone interested, this type of misleading argument is an example of a [non sequitur, or formal fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_fallacy).
Here we have two claims.
1. Canada will face a climate reckoning.
2. There is an enormous cost to ignoring the warnings.
The first claim is undeniably true, climate change will greatly affect Canada, as well as the rest of the world.
The second claim is integrated in such a way as to make it seem the inevitable conclusion of the first. However, it is not. As a minor greenhouse gas emitter, whether or not we ignore the warnings will have little impact on the cost that we will bear. We will face a "climate reckoning" regardless of how much we heed or ignore the warnings.

I wonder if all the people screaming at others about masks and vaccines will switch to screaming about giving up cars, living in a shoebox apartment and eating bugs when the government brings in mandates.
Cliff Mass a UW professor explains it pretty throughly in his blog [Were the Sumas Floods Caused by Global Warming? The Evidence Says No.](https://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2021/11/were-sumas-floods-caused-by-global.html)
Yes, but talking about climate change in a nebulous fashion avoids having to deal with the problems that you mention.
Thank you for stating the obvious much more eloquently than I would have.
That was an accident waiting to happen regardless of climate change.
Hmmm. So you're saying politicians had the choice between taking responsibility for something or blaming external factors, and they chose the latter?
It's like you don't understand that climate change leads to an increased rate of extreme weather events that directly lead to infrastructure damage in Canada. The article is perfectly correct making the connection between climate change and increased infrastructure costs for Canada. Anybody with a couple of brain cells to bang together understands that.
Meanwhile, Canada's main contribution to global warming isn't what we burn domestically, but what Canada exports being a major oil producer.
You're peeking at the Reddit of 10 years from now.
If everyone would just eat the bugs like PM Freeland had ordered, we could have all gone back to normal by now!
All these anti-43rd booster plague rats are stopping us from ending the pandemic.  
I almost forgot to wear my fifth mask while shopping yesterday. Luckily, all the side eyes from the other essential shoppers made me realize my foolishness. If they could have seen my face under my four masks, it would have been bright red! Really looking forward to my Zoom 2.0 New Years 2031 party tonight.
No problem mate
Never let a good crisis go to waste
It's like you don't understand that **no matter what we do, we will be facing climate change and extreme weather events**.
This is why I only drink wine.
I just got home and made 2L of Tang and drank a few cups before finding this in my inbox. A different date, though. Good thing because I'm 1/2 through the second canister. Interestingly I'd also ordered the countrytime but apparently I refused delivery because it was damaged without ever seeing it. Maybe this is why.

Picture a small southern United States town in 1968.  Picture that police force and the way they interact with the public, including elected officials they don't like, wounded animals, and teenage girls dressed in obvious costumes with a toy gun.  
You now have an accurate picture of the Lethbridge Police Service.
Cops not investigating their own?
I'm shcked. Shocked!
Well, not that shocked.
As the police, we can't be expected to *investigate* allegations to determine if there was a *crime*, especially when it's one of our own ...
I'm very grateful to live in Nova Scotia where breast screening is available to women over 40. Every woman in their 40's should at the very least have a baseline mammogram. 
Because I have no family history of breast cancer, and was statistically at a lower risk than the average woman, I only got around to getting my first mammogram at 46, and only because a friend was pressuring me to. Surprise! Early stage breast cancer was discovered. 
Maybe my cancer is slow growing and would never have impacted my life. I won't know that until after surgery. But I'm grateful that I don't have to wait another 4 years to find it.
Canada needs to improve breastfeeding rates to reduce the high rates of breast cancer. It's very disturbing how women were overdiagnosed with breast cancer and given chemo as well because of it.
NS has some of the highest rates of breast cancer in Canada not sure why another poster is praising it.
The reality is places with extremely low breastfeeding rates (ns is at the bottom) have high breast cancer rates and canada is behind third world countries in this regard. Our healthcare system is biased against womens health to an extrême and seems to cause more issues for women than it fixes.
ITT: Laypersons who don't understand risk stratification, RRR and ARR and believe imaging is the answer to all preventative health concerns
NNT and NNH are also considerations and they are impacted by over screening
The article explains why you’re wrong. Good thing you’re not a health professional.
With less women (well couples) having children that number is going to go up.
I'm praising NS because they offer annual screening to women starting at 40, which is your know, a good thing to do when you have high rates of breast cancer.
How does promoting breast feeding help women who don't have kids?
But this N of 1 that I know had a bad outcome so that means EVERYONE should have a full-body CT scan every 6 months, just in case of…stuff!
This is why I hate health ‘journalism’ in general, and the CBC has been particularly bad with it lately.
Pretty sure that article explains why the Canadian Task Force on Preventative Health Care guidelines are based on a faulty study.
And it's a good thing I live somewhere that doesn't follow them.
Not Just that the the age of first pregnancys being later makes it go up as well.
Womens bodies are unfortunately like a clock, instead of fighting against nature we should be studying ways to work within in maybe by fooling our bodies into thinking theyve been pregnant and lactating , or encouraging lactation outside of pregnancy
It's not good when it results in unecessary chemo, and not in the context of NS having policies that lead to higher cancer rates.
Nothing exists in a bubble there are reasons why cancer rates are high here that have to do with flaws in the healthcare system , specifically lack of breast health éducation and breastfeeding promotion policies
You dont need to be pregnant to lactate
You have breast cancer, it isnt good. Women receiving chemo unecessarily also isnt good. 
NS health also isnt good as everyone can see by looking at stats.
Nope. Read the final two paragraphs.
The beginning of the article is one radiologist (who makes a fortune reading mammograms) who (surprise, surprise) wants more mammograms to be ordered. Because 7 people in a study of tens of thousands she thinks were put in the wrong study arm.
Didn't know later pregnancies also contribute. There is a good radio lab about pregnancy and women's health. A lot of autoimmune disorders are also cured through pregnancy. 
https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/unsilencing
Funny part is one of the hosts bring that last line up:
>MOLLY WEBSTER: There's this weird thing where I'm like, oh, crap. I should get pregnant. Like - it's like - oh, and it's funny because one of my colleagues was like, you know, there's already so much societal pressure on women to, you know, follow to conform. And now, like, really, biology is telling us that 'cause we're not getting pregnant, you know, we're f***ing ourselves, essentially.
.....
>ELISSA WILSON: Science is not saying go get pregnant. It's not, a hundred percent not. What it's saying is that pregnancy may have shaped our immune systems. So let's figure out what components of our immune systems respond to the placenta, what components of our immune systems act independently of that. And then we can narrow in on the treatments.
You only get chemo when you have invasive cancer. Early detection (mammograms in your 40's) means you find cancer before it becomes invasive, such as mine. Unless pathology from my surgery shows invasive cancer, I will not be getting "needless" chemotherapy. I really don't know where you've gotten that idea from. 
I'm quite happy you don't have a better understanding of breast cancer treatment because that means you've never had to experience. I hope it stays that way for you.
And many women don't lactate either. Point? Zero.
Who said anything about chemo? 
I'm saying that my breast cancer would not have been detected until it was more advanced than it is now if I hadn't had access to breast screening in my 40's. In fact, I will probably *avoid* chemo because it has been found before it could become invasive (hopefully).
The final two paragraphs are simply their response. 
Do you really think the 4 provinces and territories are using scarce health care resources for breast screening women in their 40's for no benefit?  
The fact is that women who start breast cancer screening in their 40's are less likely to die of breast cancer. ([https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/106/11/dju261/1496367](https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/106/11/dju261/1496367)).
The Canadian Task Force on Preventative Health Care acknowledges their guidelines on screening mammography for women in their 40's don't apply to
>These recommendations don’t apply to anyone at increased risk of breast cancer, such as those with a personal or family history of breast cancer, carriers of specific gene mutations (or who have a first-degree relative with these mutations), or chest radiation therapy before 30 years of age.
and yet genetics is now known to be associated with only 5-10% of breast cancer. 
Mammography is an efficient and cost effective way to reduce deaths from cancer.  It is far preferable to identify cancer in its early stages, where it can be managed through surgery and radiation, or surgery alone, than to wait until systemic treatments are also required. Systemic treatments are not only far more expensive, they significantly reduce the quality of life for patients, and carry their own risks.
Exactly thank you. I do breastfeeding advocacy and its frustrating when politics get in the way of facts.
 Facts are not attacks we should understand these mechanisms instead of being angry they exist.
There is so much we dont know because it is politically incorrect to say when we should be focusing on improving health outcomes regardless of the seemingly unfair (from a work perspective) reality
You just spammed this across half a dozen subreddits in under five minutes. What gives?
Ah, The Breach. Such a reputable and balanced outfit.
There is honestly so much misinformation in this article that it’s impossible to take seriously.
To pick 2 from a long list:
*”Climate experts say that LNG, which also releases methane that is 84 times more powerful than carbon dioxide, will make it impossible for British Columbia to meet its climate targets.”*
- Yes, methane is a more potent GHG than CO2. Estimates range from 30x to 80x. However, LNG by itself doesn’t “release” methane - it is mainly methane, after all - and these “climate experts” provide no context. If there is methane leakage at the wellhead (site of production) or venting (from the pipeline or from processing facilities, for example from excess pressures) then yes, methane can be “released”. But every reputable company including all of the ones involved in LNG Canada have major initiatives underway to trap methane. This doesn’t get a lot of attention, but the patch has moved quickly on emissions measurement using companies such as Validere, and most companies have very aggressive methane reduction targets by 2025 - LNG Canada won’t even be on stream until at least that year. 
Methane will be reduced by 45% in both BC and Alberta by 2025 in large part due to action from the oil & gas sector. 
As for LNG Canada being incompatible with BC’s GHG targets, BC produced 69 mm tonnes of CO2e in 2019. LNG Canada phase 1 will produce 4 mm tonnes annually, assuming no efficiencies are found. And this doesn’t account for displaced emissions in Asia from coal.
*“​​Ironically, demand for LNG is beginning to fade globally, and it is clear that there is an oversupply problem. So purely on commercial grounds, the NDP’s gas push is a complete boondoggle,” Carroll said.*
This is so laughably false that anyone with a shred of common sense should know better than to say something like this. 
From Shell’s website, a global LNG leader:
“Global LNG demand is expected to reach 700 million tonnes by 2040, according to forecasts, as demand for natural gas continues to grow strongly in Asia and gains further traction in powering hard-to-electrify sectors. As a result, more supply investment will be needed to avoid the estimated supply demand gap in the middle of the current decade.”
[Shell reference](https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/natural-gas/liquefied-natural-gas-lng/lng-outlook-2021.html#iframe=L3dlYmFwcHMvTE5HX091dGxvb2svMjAyMS8)
Note that demand in 2019 was 358m tonnes. So, it’s expected to double in 20 years. Our global population is growing and energy intensity is growing as more people move out of extreme poverty, especially in Asia.
I hate irresponsible energy journalism.
Propaganda mouthpieces, my dude. You get used to it.
The old firehose technique.

"LNG is methane"
Roll intro
Kinda surprised it wasn't renamed 81 years ago when Petain became a Nazi collaborator and puppet.  Canadians were quicker to rename Berlin, Ontario.
That said, it's neat that it's in an area with several peaks named for French WWI generals, as there's a Mount Foch, Mount Cordonnier, and a Mount Mangin nearby.
We loved him after Verdun, hated him after Vichy France.  Tough to know what to make of this guy 70-80 years after the fact.
I feel like this is pretty late in the game to make this decision.  Did WWI and WWII vets express opinions on this contemporaneously?
It shouldn't be controversial to remove a Nazi collaborator's name from a mountain in Canada.  Seems pretty clear cut.
> Kinda surprised it wasn't renamed 81 years ago when Petain became a Nazi collaborator and puppet. 
William Lyon MacKenzie King wasn't much better.
France put him on trial and sentenced him to death after WW2. de Gaulle commuted the sentence to life in prison. It was pretty clear how they felt at the time.
You would think, but the vote in the East Kootenay district was 7-4. Somewhat predictably, one guy said it was an example of "cancel culture". The mayor of Sparwood, former CPC MP David Wilks, said that Petain may have been "looking out for the best interests of France"
https://thecjn.ca/news/petain-mountain-british-columbia/
"One jew is one too many!"
-MacKenzie
>It was pretty clear how they felt at the time.
Who, the French?  The mountain isn't in France.
I was referring to Canadian vets, you know, the WWI ones who fought shoulder to shoulder with troops under Petain's command in Verdun and elsewhere, and Canadian WWII vets who had to deal with Vichy France.
I'm wondering if there was any uproar from these fellows back in the 40's, 50's or 60's.
Even in modern France, under Macron, the erasure of Petain isn't as cut and dried as you're making it out to be: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/07/world/europe/macron-petain-nazis.html
>The mayor of Sparwood, former CPC MP David Wilks, said that Petain may have been "looking out for the best interests of France"
Do you disagree?
I would argue that he was very much "looking out for the best interests of France".  It just so happens that "looking out for the best interests of France" isn't much of an excuse when submitting to the Nazis was very fucking bad for the interests of anyone else, including and especially the French Jews.  Besides, Hitler was one of the history's biggest backstabbing, lying pieces of shit, so submitting to him to "look out for the best interests of your country" was always a serious miscalculation.  Stalin tried in, Petain tried it and both paid for it.
But the war with Germany was already lost when Petain was put in charge in 1940.  So it's not like he took an army on the verge of victory and told them to lay down their arms.  He took a defeated army and tried to extract some concessions from one of history's biggest shitbags.
In some ways I find Petain to be sympathetic, most poignantly because he was 84 in 1940, was probably suffering from dementia and went from the sort of guy who would have a mountain named after him in Canada to the sort of guy who would have the mountain renamed: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/o53tfm/by_1947_philippe_p%C3%A9tain_had_a_serious_dementia/h2l3x63/
Petain's legacy is very complicated, I feel sad for "The Lion of Verdun" Petain's legacy, while thinking that "Vichy France" Petain can go fuck himself.  Not entirely clear how to reconcile those two phases of this man's life, especially when facts point to "Vichy France" Petain being in the grips of what we would now call Alzheimer's disease .
He sent a congratulatory telegram to Hitler after Dieppe. I imagine the Dieppe veterans weren't too thrilled about that. 
https://www.nytimes.com/1942/08/24/archives/vichy-praise-of-nazis-at-dieppe-for-repulse-of-allies-reported.html
>Do you disagree?
The French did when they sentenced him to death for treason. There's a line between trying to get your people through a difficult time and actively participating in the crimes of the Nazis. Also, sending Hitler a congratulatory note after 907 Canadians died at Dieppe is not the act of someone just trying to get his people through a difficult time.
https://www.nytimes.com/1942/08/24/archives/vichy-praise-of-nazis-at-dieppe-for-repulse-of-allies-reported.html
> I imagine the Dieppe veterans weren't too thrilled about that.
Agree, probably not too thrilled.  My Grandfather, a 5 year WWII vet, basically hated the French because of Vichy France.  He'd describe them as "Not much better than the Germans."
I'm wondering if there's anything contemporaneous though, in the 40s, 50s and 60s a massive chunk of the Canadian population would have lived through both wars with lots serving in one or the other and must have had thoughts on Mount Petain.  You're putting me in the role of defender of this mountain and Petain, when my actual argument is that it feels weird to have random mayors playing historian in 2021 instead of respecting the wishes of Canadians directly affected by Petain.
So, what were their wishes?  Is there anything contemporaneous on how the Canadians of the day felt about Petain?  
This doesn't feel like a "greater good" thing, where you tear down a statue of Robert E. Lee because black folks have to walk past it and see that piece of shit being celebrated.  
This feels more like something we could have left to be sorted out by the the people of the day actually affected by Petain, weighing the Lion of Verdun Petain against Vichy France Petain, had they gave a shit enough about the name of some remote mountain to actually leave their opinions to history.
Yeah, he submitted to the Nazis to try to extract some concessions from one of history's biggest shitbags.
I covered that part.  We agree.  Disgusting. Fuck "Vichy France" Petain.  
You're focusing on the part I agree with you on and missing like 85% of what I posted that addresses the complexity of Petain's legacy.

The pandemic gives the Liberals two things:
1. The ability to have unprecedented control over people’s lives
2. The excuse to continue spending money like drunken sailors on shore leave with very little accountability or oversight.
They are not going to give up either easily.
We all know you are using covid to enrich the wealthy and control poor and middle class Canadians. Hold your speech and fuck off. We don't care what you have to say. You've fucked the entire youth generation of this country.
"The government is expected also to re-introduce its bill to ban conversion therapy" 
Nothing on the affordability crisis, just more fringe issues that the public already agrees with. Good work guys, now get ready for your well deserved Christmas break.
Ok let’s not mention the crippling cost of living at all. It will all just fucking work out won’t it?
Serious question:
How many times are we going to re-elect this man-child because everybody is scared of the ghost of Stephen Harper?
Are we talking, 1 or 2 more terms tops, or is this like a "Leafs Winning the Stanley Cup" situation?
Can we please talk about the crippling inflation?
>"Shit. I know shit's bad right now, with all that starving bullshit"
Even President Camacho cared about rising food costs. Trudeau though....
Shocker, they’ve been dividing the populace and scaring them for almost two years! Bunch of narcissists politicians!
Address the cost of living you corrupt piece of shit.
No thanks
Ugh no thanks
Read the article and aside from financial support for industries hit hard by the pandemic, the government isn’t announcing a damn thing to actually STOP covid-19 from being considered a pandemic in Canada.
Speech? Is he going to stand there and go brrr for 2 hours?
I mean it would be weird if they didn't mention the global pandemic.
I swear that JT has long covid, can’t seem to stop talking about it.
need the "crisis" to keep the masses busy. wake up sheeple
I support trudeau! I think he is doing great at dealing with COVID so far :)
LiViNG wiTH COviD isnt sustainable. It kills and incapacitates too many people, it's too hard on healthcare systems, even with high vaccination rates.
Allowing COVID to just become a thing means submitting to waves of sickness that will occur multiple times per year, and each one is going to be like a battering ram that taxes the healthcare system beyond capacity.
Yep yep yep. It’s lingering because they’re choosing to keep it lingering
If there’s one thing America does right, it’s consumer protection.
I thought these guys were supposed to be broke like 16 months ago? What happened, how much money did these guys keep in their mattresses?
A picture is worth a thousand words.
The vote was 50/50 between two candidates.   The photo in the article would’ve given one candidate 50%+1, but the “circle” around where the X mark should’ve been was rejected by a judge as not confirming to electoral laws (which require an X).
Therefore, under electoral laws, a coin toss will decide who wins the mayor’s seat.
Moral of the story: Don’t just show up to vote, but read the instructions (or ask if illiterate) and know ‘how’ to vote.
Sans rapport avec l'article de presse, mais l'Île d'Orléans est MAGNIFIQUE. Je recommanderais à 1000% de visiter l'île. Les fraises sont parmi les meilleures que j'ai jamais mangées et il y a aussi d'excellents restaurants. // Unrelated to the post but l'Ile d'Orleans (very close to Quebec City) is beautiful. I would 1000% recommend visiting. The strawberries are some of the best I've ever eaten and there's some great restaurants too.
Même sans lire les instructions, c'est supposé se voir assez facilement qu'encercler avec un crayon foncé sur du noir c'est pas la chose à faire...
Au moins ça se décide pas par un mesurage de graine comme dans une certaine chanson de mononc serge... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF0v7v2GtuM
Les fraises sont incroyables!
Personnellement parlant, moi je préférerais que ces têtes à Papineau n’iraient pas voter pour choisir ceux qui me/nous dirigent.

Trust your feelings, Luke.
It’s too easy to be ignorant and stupid nowadays. In fact it is idolized
When I think about the foolishness these people spread, the lies, misinformation and stupidity, it's hard to feel sympathetic when they are in fact contributing not only to their own demise, but also the deaths of others just as gullible. I guarantee, every single one of them in the hospital wasting away, wishes they had been smarter and had just been vaccinated.
Whoever says stupidity isn't highly virulent and deadly just needs to look around.
Play stupid games win stupid prizes
Go ahead.
It's too bad people have to die to learn a lesson. And the dead can't learn lessons.

Most Canadians aren't like this. Reddit is a dreadful cross section of Canadian society - unemployed, parents basement, that sort of thing. 
While Canadians are in general more deferential to government than Americans, most Canadians don't give a flying fuck about Covid anymore.
Texas has had over twice as many recorded cases and over twice as many deaths from Covid than ALL OF CANADA COMBINED. You have no place to talk.
You’re absolutely right.  So glad that Texas had returned to normal.  Well, normal in sense that more than 70,000 people can’t return to normal because you know; they’re dead from covid.    All good, keep your selfish Republican values in tact.
average 100 covid deaths per day

According to FDA modelling - fully vaccinating 1 million kids ages 5 to 11 would prevent 58,000 Covid infections, 241 hospitalizations, 77 intensive care unit stays and one death.
>"You could really feel the joy and relief that I know many of us have experienced as a result of having gotten the best protection we have against COVID-19,” Dr. Eileen de Villa, Toronto's medical officer of health, told reporters.
1. Never let a crisis go to waste.
2. There is no money in good health.
Woot woot!
I see two types of people gung-ho about this recent push to vaccinate kids:
1. The first group believes that kids are at serious risk from covid and need these doses for their own safety.
2. The second group believes that kids are not at risk, but the vaccines will prevent them from transmitting covid to those who are.
I think both camps are touting heaps of disinformation. 
-signed, a fully vaccinated adult.
we have to end this pandemic
I'm sure this thread will be a friendly collection of posts relating to keeping the children of Canada more protected against a viral epidemic. I can't imagine anyone hating that.
It also says, 
"Up to 106 kids would suffer from vaccine-induced myocarditis but most would recover, according to the agency." 
Most would recover...
Not really sure about the risk/reward here.
Can you send me the source for that modelling? Want to show it to my covid-neurotic sister.
You don't need to sign your comment, we can see your username.
I guess for now, you could just choose not to vaccinate your own school-aged child?
Inb4 "MARK OF THE BEAST"
Edit: They're heeeeeerrrrrreeeeeeeee
Yea....1 death from covid vs "some" dead kids from the vaccine? This is NOT good lol
It's been proven that the risk of developing myocarditis from Covid is higher than from getting the vaccine.
Let's say 10 children out of 1,000,000 suffer long term side effects from the vaccine - that's .001 percent.    
No matter what angle you take - the vaccines are worth it.
Edit:
4 year old account that only goes back 5 months - all anti-vaxx statements like these gems:
>"scared adults willing to sacrifice their children for the illusion of safety."
>"please explain to me how vaccinations protect the masses."
https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/white-house-says-about-900000-kids-ages-5-to-11-got-a-covid-vaccine-in-first-week.html
I don't think there is anything wrong with vaccinating kids, I just don't see what the point is. This isn't going to get us any closer to normal and kids are not at risk from covid, so what are we doing here? This world has become psychologically unwell.
But something something population control?
Where are you getting "some" dead kids from the vaccine?
1death??
So far, that modelling was predicting worse myocarditis than we are seeing for this age group.  Guess we'll have better numbers after the US gets their kids shot #2, but it's promising that I don't think there has been a reported case of myocarditis yet.

I'm more surprised the developer didn't simply cancel their project, refund their customers, then come back in a month or two as a different numbered company offering the exact same units at a higher cost.
Then fucking do something pussy
Shouldn't contracts be binding for all parties?
He slammed the scumbag developer? That'll show him!
But what did he do?
I thought the entire point of pre-con sales was to lock in a low price, and then literally by the time it's completed it's worth more than you paid?
Sounds like the developer forgot to include Doug Ford on their kickbacks list.  It's completely out of character for him to speak against developers.
Worked for this developer. Not surprised, I hope they sink in lawsuits. People bought two years ago on the promise by Pave that their units will increase in value. Guess they did, but only to Pace's benefit...
Ford is probably privately scolding the company for not raising the prices by $200k.
IF Ford does put an end to it, that would genuinely be amazing, and he’d have my vote next election.
Get your deposit back. My guess is the developer is citing raised lumber prices as an excuse.
The free market in Real Estate is out-of-fucking-control. Anyone, from any political vantage point, poor or wealthy can see it.  
I'm no economist, I don't know what makes sense but something needs to be done here. This will not fix itself. Somehow, the government needs to step in and help correct this mess. No idea what that would look like though.
Slams him through the table?
Developer got off easy. Easily deserved a suplex.
Capitalist premier criticizes capitalist corporation for maximising profit under capitalism.
Did they go for lunch right after he "slammed" him? Or is it a date first kinda deal?
> The company defended the move by pointing to the inflated costs of raw materials and labour related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Before announcing the development was coming and before putting units up for sale, wouldn't the developer have already locked in the costs of their materials.  It seems a bit unbelievable that they wouldn't.
Hahaha well he's friends with that developer company and now he's pissed at them? Well Doug you should've done something in the last 3.5 years with these developers.
Can't the develloper just get a bank loan to finish the project?
Sobering lesson for Canada: Stop giving out citizenship like it's a meaningless piece of paper. It's not.
What a drain on Canada. A citizen of convenience that has no interest in Canada except when she needs her stupid ass saved.
Great .... now we just let ISIS terrorist come back into Canada. I'm wondering if she's got  a job or is Canada's taxpayers paying for her to live? Canadian Tax payers paying and supporting Isis terrorists to live here in Canada?
Reporters can spend years in jail in China? Too bad so sad. Terrorists coming back to Canada? Better get the red carpet and say sorry.
I hear Toronto School Board is already scheduling her for speaking engagements.
Why did she leave Canada in the first place?
She left to join ISIS, didn't get her citizenship revoked, and comes back and doesn't face any charges ?! 
Honestly can we refrain from so easily giving out and maintaining Canadian citizenship?
Trudeau supporters deciding to give this discussion a miss. Funny how this didn’t happen in September.
No. ISIS woman released from lawful detention to a nation ruled by naive idiots (Canada).
She getting a 10 million $ cheque too?
To join and support the cause of Isis.
To join ISIS.
excuse me, what!?
but from the title of article it seems she was held captive by ISIS and has now been reunited with her daughter, is that not what happened? /s

It really is hard to determine what is 'unprecedented' when the accuracy and thoroughness of our meteorological records span the course of **decades** as opposed to millenia.
I agree. The use of the term unprecedented is getting played out. They seem to be running out of nouns they can use to frighten you. 
There was little to no mention of the storm that flooded BC recently until it was too late. Now bc is looking at “atmospheric rivers”!?!

Come on guys - this is nothing to boast about.  If you put a few more cops on the traffic beat instead you might actually catch more such characters and leave the public feeling better about their safety.
How much does it cost to do a 2 year investigation to net $2 million in cash and proceeds?
Seems like a complete waste of time and resources for that kind of bust.
Highlights:
* Eight Edmontonians have being charged and around $2 million in drugs, cash and proceeds of crime seized after a two-year investigation which police say spanned across Canada.
* The investigation — dubbed Project Elk — looked into a Edmonton-based trafficking network that was allegedly involved in importing drugs.
* The investigation began in November 2019 and included the assistance of the Edmonton Police Service and specialized RCMP units in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario.
* ALERT intercepted a six-kilogram shipment of cocaine from Toronto in August 2020. A series of search warrants at six Edmonton homes and one in Strathcona County were issued after that.
In the homes, police found:
    Five firearms
    10 kilograms of cocaine
    17 kilograms of a cocaine buffing agent
    4.7 kilograms of meth
    2.9 kilograms of cannabis
    $135,000 cash
* A total of 35 criminal charges ranging from drug and firearms offences, to conspiracy to commit an indictable offence, to commission of an offence for a criminal organization have been laid against the suspects.
This almost sounds like the cops milked this for all it was worth on surveillance and the like before they abso-fuckin'-lutely had to call it in.
I am sure they'll include enough procedural errors to get it all tossed before any of the good 'ol boys get to see more than a few days incarceration.
LOL  more cops on the beat doesn’t do shut to catch drug traffickers
Sounds like a mighty fine waste of resources. Just legalize it all and the state can reap the benefits.
Probably like 5x that
About tree fiddy
Well neither does a dedicated task force either.  2 years of effort and all those specialists have to show for it is $2Million.  That's not reasonable.  2 beat cops could just investigate a noise complaint at some rappers party in Toronto or Montreal and come away with more in confiscated drugs and guns.
> the state can reap the benefits
Unless you mean by that, that we no longer waste resources on it, I am in agreement.  We can't even seem to make money selling pot here in Ontario.
You really think that’s how organized crime works?
I mean, it's both. Not spending money and resources continuing the senseless war on drugs, but also bringing the product into the economy and taxing it, however marginal the benefits may be.
But yeah agree with you. Every time I read one of these headlines I can't help but think how much resources were wasted on this and at the end of the day, it doesn't solve anything.
What does it matter.  All need to know is the numbers - they're not impressive.  They stink actually.  Crap, the FBI finally gave up and used Mail Fraud to put Capone away.
Really ironic that you used a prohibition era criminal to try to explain what’s going on today…
Been that was for a long time. Arguments always came down to the following:
* it's hard to find good officers, and train them, then it is to find good troops and train them.
Having watched what's been going on in the CAF though we should be well dissuaded of that. It's abundantly clear looking at the leadership they haven't used their inflated senior ranks to achieve and retain good leaders. Just the opposite in a lot of cases.
Not to mention the argument about troop training relies on an outdated concept of what a soldier is doing and what citizens are capable of. The last time we raised a large standing army we had a citizenry that was accustomed to being outdoors, often familiar with firearms that were similar to what was being used by the military and were likely in better physical shape.
Even a so-called grunt these days is a professional job with a lot of training and specialised equipment. Sure you don't need that... But if you opt not to you'll be raising an army designed to drown your better trained opponents in the blood of your dead soldiers. Someone given a crash course in living outdoors, asked to do 20 push ups and thrown a rifle is going to get chewed up in any sort of real conflict.
Time to decide whether the CAF is a military or a club for privileged officers to play dress up.
Canada has more flag officer : troop ratio than anone else in NATO. 90% of the GOFO positions were created because of Afghanistan. Only problem is they didn't remove those positions. When that war was over in 2012.
We have one GOFO for every 440 troops. 
The USA has 1 GOFO for every 1400 troops.

I seem to recall some mild furor in the mid 90s that we actually had more generals than tanks.
Andrew Leslie wrote a report, while still in uniform, that reached the same conclusion. Neither his report nor recommendations for change were acted upon.
Anecdotally, their bureaucracy gets in the way of their own recruiting, too.  
I was entertaining the idea of military service in a highly skilled role at one point. I took the time to walk into a recruiting center only for the recruiter to tell me that I couldn't apply at a recruiting center. I was instructed to leave, go home, and apply online. If a recruiter can't recruit me at a recruiting center, honestly what are you even doing? It was bizarre, but it was enough of a signal to me, a prospective CF member, that my experience would be a bureaucratic nightmare. It was a big enough red flag that I decided not to pursue it further, because it signaled that they had no idea what they were doing in even trying to hire people.
Top heavy isn't just a euphamism. 
Being told I'm the problem by an overweight fuck who can't ruck is a god damn insult.
Not to mention the fucks in the flag staff that were directly involved in the airborne's bullshit
Seems we should reduce the amount of Generals and hire more rank and file.
One of the major problems is the disconnect between officers and NCMs.
You get higher up who don't have an understanding of the capabilities of the equipment but yet want soldiers to get things done with in time limits.
The old adage "I don't care how, just get it done" is bullshit. 
 Moral is just dead. Each and every time an article come out about an officer skatting off some charges that would destroy a soldiers career has made a lot of people with experience walk away.
From what I've read in the news lately about sexual harassment in the military I'm sure that many will be retiring soon.
ah so it's just like the medical system, esp. here in BC where we have waaaaaay too many useless middle managers, and nowhere near enough doctors.
The usual reason given for a top heavy officer corps is that we need to interact with peer nations while having a much smaller military, and to do so we need officers that are the same rank as theirs or they won't be taken seriously. That results in us having the upper leadership of a much larger force.
As a retired CAF member,it always has been top heavy. The pay inequality between non commissioned ranks and commissioned ranks is also an issue IMHO
One point that is often neglected in these discussions is that several  NATO secondments need a certain rank level.  For example, the position of commandant of the NATO Staff College in Rome is a three-star (LtGen/ VAdm), regardless of the nationality of the officer who occupies it. Similarly, seats on several committees within NATO are at a one- or two-star level. Also, some diplomatic military attachés must be of a certain rank to be on a par with their local counterparts. If a Canadian is to participate, they must hold this rank. This has led to some rank inflation. Often, these people have a hard time when returning to Canada, as postings at those high levels are less common at home. I personally remember a position temporarily being created at NDHQ to house such an officer. Their responsibilities were limited and the post disappeared a few months later when they were assigned to a substantive posting.
We are far from the days in the early 70's when we had almost 300 general/flag officers. So many, that there actually was a General's Mess at Rockliffe!
Apparently if you sexually assault 10 people, you get to be a general.
I’m the mod of /r/regretjoining and ever since I was in the US navy, I’ve wondered if other militaries were the same way. My experience in the American military was so bad that it’s a major factor in why I eventually left the United States and immigrated to Canada.
I’ve always wondered if I were born here and I joined the Canadian military instead, if I would have had the same awful experience or if it would have been ok. From people I’ve talked to and the limited interactions I’ve had with the Canadian military, it seems similar but not nearly as extreme.
Our armed forces have been a disgrace since the 70's. Brave men and women sent out to do our dirty work without the proper gear, no planes, no ships, a top down masochistic environment and a government who couldn't give a shit. We need to rearm, redeploy and rethink our armed services desperately. And with the idiots in charge it doesn't look to good for the immediate future either. Why would a serious young person join this?
i wish the canadian public had more knowledge about why the military is actually very important for us, and why it needs more investment, it will probably take a serious fuck up that the whole of canada sees clear as day for everyone to realize what has to be done
Time to increase the size of our military rank and file positions.
To some extent: this is by design. The idea is that you can train a rifleman in a year if need be, but training a general takes decades. So you want to be top-heavy in peacetime so if the need for a crash mobilization arises, you can have enough officers to command the rapidly expanded, fresh army.
But we may be over-doing it.
It's one isolated survey, it's a fairly minor increase(25% to 30%) and it includes people already employed looking for better jobs. The idea that this "proves" anything about pandemic relief is, at best, wishful thinking.
Tell me again there’s a “labour shortage”
It's been a blast looking for a job that I'm over-qualified for because the government says my job can't open to 100% capacity. 10 years, union, benefits, pension, but nope I gotta buy a pair of steel toes and go temp it.
Employers won't need to offer living wages to the desperate, small businesses are saved!
As of Nov 14 there were still 1,033,800 Canadians on EI. There are about 900,000 job vacancies in the country.
I think you can both argue that this demonstrates the need for higher wages, but at the same time having this many Canadians on the dole is simply unsustainable.
No way
Imagine that.
What? People kept claiming that CRB didn't affect people's willingness to work (a laughable position that made no sense...)
Wow, who ever would have thought that this would happen. 🤣🤣🤣
Literally LOL.
The joy I'm seeing about people being forced back to bullshit jobs for shit wages is infuriating.
Just because you work doesn't mean everyone should. I am typing this from my job right now and hold no ill will to those who don't want to work too hard for not enough pay.
Newsflash:if you pay minimum wage, and your employees showed up sober and on time, they already earned their pay for the day. Pay a living wage.
If you read the article it’s not nearly as clear cut or provocative as the headline suggests. The National Post really pushes hard on this idea from something one economist with Indeed says:
Two (still early) trends I'm tracking are sending contrasting signals.
I'm seeing fewer aimless people who won't respect personal space roaming about like zombies. It's like coved was the dreaded zombie apocalypse and I hope all enjoyed it. Now, get back to work!
[deleted]
Imagine that. No more free money. I guess I need to get off my ass and work to pay my bills.
You're right. We don't need a survey to understand human nature.
Lol
Nothing like the threat of starvation and homelessness to motivate the slave class.
We have the same unemployment as we did before the pandemic our immigration minister said it best.
We need more immigrants to stop wages from raising during this high inflation period.
I feel you I’m a av tech as conferences continue to cancel with every wave of covid and subsequent restrictions I’m still struggling to get any work.. unless it’s for funerals.

You don't need your name on too many fish to get top stamps at these prices.
I might get downvoted for this but lately the media have been absolutely riding this extreme fear mongering train. Like they had no idea the first storm was going to be what it was and now Noah get your Arc.
All this “supply chain disruption” had talk radio telling me I need to get used to canned and frozen vegetables in Alberta. 
I buy wholesale groceries for a living and it’s certainly not as dire as such. It’s just causing people to panic and hoard.
Don’t get me wrong here, I think being prepared is important and leaving if you’ve been asked to. I just feel they’re thriving on everyone being on edge and I think it’s wrong.
"Parade of storms".  Now *that's* not something you hear everyday.
I strongly recommend that anyone who has not yet stocked up on basic emergency supplies to please do so now. Basic disaster and first aid kits from ~~Amazon~~ a local store will go a long way
And no, I do not mean hoard food and gas, because that is not helping the situation right now. Take only what you need of those things so that others can get what they need too.
Serious question about what happens to land titles during climate change, I AM NOT SUGGESTING THIS WILL HAPPEN HERE:
You own land, suddenly the land is permanently at the bottom of a lake. Do you still own the land or is it forfeit because you can’t own water?
Is "atmospheric rivers" a new term? Never heard it before.
The effects of climate change is really  starting to rear its ugly head in Canada. Floods, droughts, fires, this is what climate change looks like. It's only going to get worse too.
Holy shit. The East Coast is currently preparing for one these suckers at this very moment and all the comparisons are "similar to what happened on the west coast"
This is absolutely nightmare fuel.
I was stationed at the forces base at Chilliwack in  late 1970’s. Irony is most of the base was Engineers. I remember a huge Base Supply warehouse full of boats, portable bridges, pumps, etc.   However, as a geologist I always questioned some of the development in the area. Even a modest earthquake coming at an inopportune time will trigger a lot of liquefaction that will literally destroy everything standing. 
 One day of noticeable rain in here Calgary in over two months. I put out water bowls for the coyotes and other critters, Perhaps we can build a water pipe line from the West Coast.
Welcome to Fall weather.
gg
Somebody call in the Dutch to help get these levies and dikes re-built!
This is fine.
Just. Freaking. Lovely. 
The end has begun, folks.
Are atmospheric rivers common? How many happen per year? First time I ever heard the term.
And our climate change reckoning continues.
fear sells news. always has, always will.
The funny thing is that the worst case scenarios scientists tell the media about climate change is actually some of the better outcomes from their predictions. The actual worst case scenarios are absolutely unbelievable and I suspect that if they said these worst case scenarios no one would believe them.
Have a read of the latest IPCC report: https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Full_Report.pdf
You should be afraid.  This is the new norm and is why people are rightfully losing their shit over climate change.
The media? Acting in bad faith? I dare say this is shocking indeed.
Sounds like a song you play on an ocarina

Good luck southwestern Newfoundland; from southwestern BC. Fingers crossed for you that no major damage occurs
It should be noted that 1/100 year storm doesn't mean that it's gonna happen once every 100 years. 
It basically means that the probability of having x amount of rain in any single year is 1/100.
Get yer raincoats byes.
It looks like Frankie hasn't mentioned it, so I'm not sure it's official yet...
Hey look - BC had a once in a century storm last week! What are the odds!
BC: We just went through the worst storm ever!
Nfld: Hold my Screech.
Good luck guys! Be safe, keep dry!
Gotta stop saying "1 in 100 year". 
It has connotations that whatever it is has happened before and that is apparently not the case.  There may have been a big storm or whatever 10 yeas ago that was also a 1 in 100 year event.
If it is a record even, say so, if not then tell us when the last time a similar event occurred.
This whole 1 in 100 year phenomenon has officially come to an end, major weather events are going to be more frequent and more severe, that's the reality.
Man, crazy how these 1 in 100 year events keep happening all at the exact same time. Almost as though there's a common cause that's coming to a head. Oh well, I'm sure if we continue to ignore it, it'll be completely fine.
Beer snd storm chips
In the olden days, it would be snow!
These "once in a hundred years" events sure are happening often nowadays.
Next year it will be 1 in 365 days storm
Damn stephenville was pretty well levelled back in 2005 or so with only 140mm. And it only called for 50mm. Good thing they didn’t rebuild in any of the flood plains
Is that bad for Newfoundland? I thought it was kinda rainy there?
1 in 100 year storms are now every 6 months storms in BC. I'm guessing it's about the same on the east coast too.
Ok the 1 in 100 storms are now 1 in 5 if lucky. With climate change a current 1 in 100 would wipe nfld off the map
Think we have to start calling them 1-100 days storm

Getting rid of the zoning for single family homes only is the easiest first step the city can take, and it's better than doing nothing or clearing the green space for more low-density SFH subdivisions (and the inevitable more-congested highways that follows).  More duplexes, triplexes and low-rise apartments is certainly better moving forward.
> But of more than 2,100 respondents so far to a city survey on the issue, 88 per cent back multiplexes citywide, and the new report signals support within city hall. 
I don't know who they've been asking, but I'm genuinely glad that's the response.
Going to have to happen sooner or later. Toronto doesn't have the space to accommodate any more Single-Family Detatched houses, and desperately needs more housing options; especially in the missing middle of duplexes and row houses. Unless of course you're okay with the environmental impacts of every worker who didn't have rich parents having to commute into Toronto.
This is exactly what we need, when you can fit a 40 unit building where 8 houses would normally be everyone wins except the NIMBYs
convert office spaces to apartments
Yes good
More density
About time. These “character” single family homes on the Danforth, Cabbagetown, Forest Hill are all a bunch of NIMBYs who is making this province more expensive for everyone. 
Finally we have some resistance against these selfish homeowners. 
They also claim that auto shops and parking lots are the hub of their communities.
It's about damn time. With the exception of Old Toronto the rest of the boroughs outside of maybe East York and parts of Etobicoke are still designed like post war suburbs. Scarborough and North York in particular have no reason to be as low slung as they are now. The uptown strip on Yonge is the strangest thing ever with the ultra dense towers sitting next to sub divisions. While we're at it we should try and get the 905 cities on board as well and curtail the level of sprawl we engage in.
Good. this also allows more space for greenspaces. Im actually writing a paper on that right now (just took a break to pop on here). It is NOT an easy thing to balance, but the benefits will be pronounced.
Great idea. I'm not sure why everyone wants a single detached house anyway... Do you need sideyards if they're so small and dark that nothing grows?  Many people have rear yards that they never use...maybe just mow once and awhile, some even just let them go to shit. Makes much more sense to add density.
Oh the NIMBYs are going to be pissed.
Can guarantee this "chief planner" making 300k plus will \*never\* deal with the fallout of this and his neighbours would be the first to pose cross-armed and pinch-faced for a Toronto Star article whose headline reads: "Neighbours rally around proposed 12-unit rental building in historic heritage district".
Just tell me where I can live a normal suburban life with single family homes, and I'll move there.  Make Toronto as dense as you want, but that's just not my bag.
man as long as they're built right, make housing denser. current shitbox I live in with my gf has 30 y/o insulation between the units and nothing else (just the plywood/floor/wood stuff) all I want is to be able to quietly sit in our bedroom without hearing people coming down the stairs from three floors above. idk what building codes are like but if it ain't concrete between units, it isn't worth it.
Canada desperately needs to build [housing's missing middle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCOdQsZa15o) and work as hard as possible to make cars the worst option for travel in cities (ie. by making transit, biking, walking, etc. not only *possible* but *the best options*).
Good. The single family home model is simply not good for useful all.
About damn time.
Multi-family mixed-use developments increase the tax base to bring in more revenue for the city, and denser neighbourhoods make municipal services cheaper to provide or more effective per tax dollar spent. 
Problem is, densifying neighbourhoods leads to a decrease in home prices as this recent [UBC study](https://news.ubc.ca/2021/11/18/laneway-homes-decreases-neighbouring-property-values-affluent-areas-ubc-study) on garage/garden laneway suites found. If a single small suite in a neighbourhood can affect prices that much, a big development is going to be far worse which is why so many people are opposed to it.
More density please. Imagine all those old single family homes get replaced with thin townhomes or small multi family units. Society would benefit so much!
Provinces and the federal government should instead be encouraging businesses to setup outside of Toronto and allow remote work. The main reason people live where they do is because that is where their employment is.
Is it less tax revenue for Toronto? Yes. Is it better for everyone involved in terms of distributing jobs, people, traffic, pollution, etc. across southern Ontario or the country? Also, yes.
Cities won't be happy until their multi-million populaces are living in Judge Dredd mega-blocks like roaches. Right now, it's "single-family homes are selfish and wasteful". In 20 or 30 more years it'll be "multi-unit homes are selfish and wasteful". Repeat until everyone is living in a 10ft concrete cubes stacked a mile into the air because that's the most city/infrastructure-friendly way to pack urban workers.
Why not tax the hell out of new businesses in Toronto to incentivize them to build elsewhere? Barrie? Newmarket? Aurora? Richmond Hill? Georgetown? We should be trying to spread out the population to alleviate all the inefficiencies caused by high population density (mostly traffic/commuting/pollution).
I don't see reporters and planners interested in the quality of life of higher-density neighbourhoods. Bylaws need to be better enforced. People should not be allowed to have pets off-leash. People should be heavily fined for not picking up after their dogs. Perhaps there needs to be more complexes that don't allow pets. The same goes for noise. We need to beef up building codes to make soundproof walls and windows. We need bylaw officers enforcing outside noise restrictions. We need to ensure that people who live with more people still enjoy their property.
Canadas economy, along with it's civil liberties; have been in steep decline for a VERY long time.  Long before Trudeau.  This sharp downward decline will continue.
Thank the creepy, covert Security Industrial Complex.  It's not only Canadians that are victims, bankrupting our nation and morality, it's also our allies who do not trust them...
Natpo months ago: "OMG the Liburelz r gunna turn us into communist Cuba with the Great Reset!!!1!1"
Natpo now: "Lol Trudeau doesn't have the balls to do the Great Reset."
Make up your mind Natpo, do you want him to do it or not?
tldr: The National Post doesn't like the Liberal government.
Can't believe they actually brought up the great reset only fringe conspiracy theorists even entertain that idea.
On second thought....
It’s almost like the point of the NatPo is just to keep the more gullible segment of conservatives in a constant state of vague, unfocused outrage.
You're aware that Chrystia Freeland is (or was, I haven't checked lately) on the board of directors for the WEF, yes?
What do you think the World Economic Forum does?
Among other things, run a web site that talks about a "Great Reset?"
The unvaccinated are less than ten percent of the population. Vaccination rates in BC, for instance, are above 90% now. And the real hard-core anti-vaxxers are perhaps ten percent of the unvaccinated. And it's not like everyone buys ice cream.
Chapman's is not going to miss the purchases of a fraction of a percent of the population. 
Anti-vaxxers are absolutely deluded as to their real numbers... but, then, they also don't understand that their facebook and twitter feeds are filled with bots and bad actors that are purposefully misleading them.
Boycotting ice cream in November? So brave.
Among the most reasonable covid vaccine policies from a company we’ve seen made public. 
Boycott won’t make a fuckin DENT
Nurse, my throat is sore can I have some ice cream?
Sure, it’s chapmans! *winks at camera
>"I'm going to boycott your product!"
Says people who probably weren't buying said product to begin with.
I can't recall all the details, but Chapman's has proved to be an actual good company throughout the pandemic. They gave a pay bump when everyone else was, but are one of the few companies to make it permanent and I think they donated freezer space for storing the vaccine. Now, they are not only compromising with their unvaccinated employees, but giving another pay bump to the vaccinated ones. 
Seems like a company trying to do all the right things, fuck these idiots and their stupid boycott, I only buy Chapman's ice cream, good companies are so rare these days.
>On Nov. 7, Chapman’s started twice-a-week rapid testing for about 100 of their 850 employees, who had decided against getting vaccinated. Five employees refused, and are currently on unpaid leave.
Imagine losing your job (even temporarily) because you refused to get vaccinated *or* tested.
>On Nov. 12, Chapman’s announced they’d be giving their fully-vaccinated employees a $1 per hour raise by month’s end. Disgruntled employees leaked the raise news to some anti-vaccine groups, who have in turn launched a boycott of Chapman’s products.
Seriously, *that's* what they're mad about?  The company isn't even punishing unvaccinated employees, they're just rewarding those who got vaccinated.
And realistically, the vaccinated employees save the company money, since they don't require the regular tests.
I fucking *love* ice cream, but very rarely indulge. When I do, it’s Chapman’s NSA Black Cherry. The stuff is frozen heroine. 
I bought a tub a few days ago, after hearing about these addled losers and their sad little project.
Welp.  There goes the diet.  Chapman's after breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the foreseeable future.  I'm calling this one as summer 2023.
"Druthers is an anti-vaccine, anti-COVID-19-restriction alternative publication."
For god sake CTV. We're still not willing to call spades spades? "Alternative publication"
Fucking lol
Chapman’s ice cream is the best, and it’s Canadian. I will buy a little extra next purchase to support them. Anti -Vaxxers are just anarchists. They don’t really care about Canada or Canadians.
Went shopping tonight. 
Bought Chapman's. 
Yum
Now I feel a little better about buying icecream every week.
Damn it, I already only buy Chapman's ice cream because we like it.  I guess maybe an ice cream party is in order or something...
Well shit, now I have to go back into town and buy some Chapman's ice cream
Good. It’s too good for them
I have never paid attention to what company I buy ice cream from. Now I will buy from Chapman’s.
Good. More ice-cream for me
Hilarious thinking the 4% of Canadians who are antivaxxers are going to make any sort of a significant dent in this company's business. 🤣
Off to the store to get me some Chapmans Ice cream and I don't even really eat that much ice-cream.
Canadian is a big stretch here.
NASA has spent $18b on this telescope and the last $2b is msty ESA with Canada providing a couple instruments
Canadian? Uhhhhhhhhhh
This telescope is as Canadian as the ISS...
I mean there’s a Canadian instrument on it but it’s a nasa lead project with the ESA doing the launch. Not exactly Canadian. What a click bait of a article.
From Dec 18 to Dec 22. We still may beat the [XKCD date](https://xkcd.com/2014/)
I need this thing in space, doing science. If the launch/deployment fails I'll be heartbroken.
ive been waiting on this for so long.  i have the 18th marked in my calendar and an alarm already set.  im really starting to give up :(
So techbomb wants an 18b space telescope sent up even thought it's not 100% ready?  What kind of idiot would actually say that's a good idea?
Man.. I totally get this. If JW fails at any point, this is going to be the highest profile failure that NASA has ever had. I wouldn't want to be the person to say its for sure good this time, only to have my department be the reason that it failed haha.
Yeah, not really Canada's telescope, really bad headline here.  
Much of the hangups have been the Yanks. We've got observation time (and that's awesome), but our contribution is small
LMAO I know right.
From the Article
"The Webb Space Telescope is an international partnership with the European and Canadian space agencies and is one of the most exciting launches in Canadian Space Agency history."
A Telescope named after a NASA Director, with a NASA expenditure of 10Billion+, and NASA is only credited at the end of the article. 
The fk is this writing.
Going to be launched by the Canadian Ariane 5 too? Lol
I mean... We could always annex the ISS...
I really want JW to succeed, because it'll do some really amazing, science-changing stuff... But if there's a fuck up, given all of the hangups and it's massive development time, I really will have to laugh
Not too worried about deployment, I'm worried they'll have bugs or errors in design just like they did in the hubbles lense.
From Canadian Guiana in South Canada, naturally.

For everyone that’s hot and horny for CRB recipients freaking out, that’s not really the whole story. 
“The survey also showed a “statistically significant” increase in searches by people already employed”
Too bad they didn’t put a link to the source material. Junk journalism.
People: government aid to stay at home doesn’t deter people from seeking work. 
Also people: holy shit the government funded aid to stay at home is over, I need to get a job!
just to clarify it's only a 5% difference in those who are looking for work; not a 39% difference.
I mean, they had a year of warning and 6 months of a roaring job market.
I'm so glad everyone read the article and isn't just using the headline to spew garbage about their favourite hot button issues.
"Finally, the poors are being put back serving us. Now to jack up interest rates and foreclose on their homes, muahahahaha!" - Possibly overheard on Bay Street.
*Clearly sarcasm. Rich people would never be so cruel.
Good. Let them work.
Looks good on them. They should have been back to work much earlier.
They should have been on this a while ago, they only extended it past the election for the votes. Should have known it was going to not be extended any further
You mean Trudeau won't keep paying them to stay at home forever?
Guess that is what happens when you get kicked off of the taxpayer funded gravy train.
Can't be that urgent when all you see online is "If you can't afford to pay your workers a living wage I guess you deserve to go out of business."
But hey, it's as easy as printing money.
People desperate for jobs that pay enough to cover the bills.
The reality is that unless you have specialized skills such as coding (for now, until AI moves along more..) then you will have to accept the living standard of the people who are fleeing worse off countries.
When 8-14 international students are willing to pile into a house and continue taking jobs that should be 50k+ for 35k, then we are going to continue our quality of life backslide.
Remember: Canada brings in 400 000 people people per to keep wages low so capitalists can continue to enjoy large profit while the environment burns and people's well being is disrupted.
Guess we have our answer on UBI
I was working during the entire pandemic and I got myself a 10%-15% pay rise to do work I like better, and that isn't mandating us back into the office. The iron's hot if you've got the skills employers want, just need to get out there and put some effort into interviewing.
The end of benefits, coupled with people that refused to vaccinated and lost their job and added to by people like me who are looking to take jobs that were lost. I’ve been gainfully employed for the entire pandemic but if other places are offering more than what I’m currently making I’m always willing to move.
I find it hard to believe 2 grand was more than enough for the lazy to survive on
Also, have you heard? Water is wet.
Had 20 months to find a job wait till the money runs out.
What price? worst case he loses the election and moves on to something cushy while he and his get richer.
There will be Liberal posters who claim to be economists that will say there is nothing that can be done, this this is supply chains.
I'm here to tell you there are things that can be done and Justin just doesn't care. Biden has ordered ports run 24/7 to help with these "supply chains". I live in Halifax our port could and should be running around the clock. It would be good for employment, if "supply chains" are the issue than this would help and with BCs ports down the country needs to bring in goods. Trudeau is too busy not doing anything to even try and help Canadians though.
Open the ports and long term look at rasing interest rates because many economists are now saying inflation is getting sticky. Don't let us get caught in a wage price spiral. Start to think long term. This government is failing us at a time when we should be bouncing back and building back
He will pay?? 
A millionaire trust fund baby that will collect a Prime Minsters pension for the rest of his life??
No, us, Canadian taxpayers, will be the ones paying the price LOL
I like how our Prime Minister has been totally absent during the past 2 months. Do we even have anyone who gives a fuck?
I know, the answer is no and it is about extracting profit from us unwashed masses. I miss the days when politicians at least pretended to work for us.
No, the poor and average Canadians will pay the price.  Justin may be forced from politics, but he won't suffer for it.
IE: Toronto will vote him in again
Clearly not when he just got re-elected and inflation has been spiking well before that. This country is too afraid of change.
> As inflation woes impact Canadians, Justin Trudeau will pay the price
Well, not, like, literally; he's not actually going to be on the hook to buy you anything.
Trudeau is going to come out with some woke nonsense to try and distract us from this, without a doubt. This is the government that tabled right to work legislation *twice*. They do not care about people below the highest tax bracket.
If Justin hasn't paid the price for all the shit he's already done to us, I sincerely doubt there are enough Canadians who will be turned at this point.
No he won't, at the end of the day it won't matter what happens to Canadians because he'll keep getting voted in due to the GTA and people who are so deathly afraid of the Conservatives potentially getting government that they would hurt themselves to keep the liberals in.
These articles are written by people with *no* connection to the realities of everyday life. It's honestly fucking disgusting.
I'm sure [*fill in party leaders name*] will be crying in their massive house, with their vehicles in the garage, family nearby, food in the fridge, investments skyrocketing, property values through the roof, friends are all wealthy, family is set for life, have a cottage if not multiple properties to vacation to.. 
I dont care if people are staunch conservatives or super lefty liberals or whatever.. these leaders need to be held to a *fucking way higher* standard, I'm tired of media treating them with respect that should be for fucking war heroes.
You cant print money 24/7 and hand it out like candy with no consequences.
He already held a sham election and was handed another win by spineless Canadians too afraid to leave a 2 party system. I’m ashamed of my countrymen. If you voted liberal, you’re a failure
All this government  and the NDP who prop them up cares about:
* Internet Censorship.
* Hurtful comments online
* Dress codes for women on the house of commons.
* Helping the Big Three screw over Canadians .
They don't care about working Canadians, both leaders have trust funds and does not affect them.
Will he really? So when he finally gets kicked out of government and goes back to a multimillion dollar net worth lifestyle with highly paid speaking gigs to keep stroking his vanity he will really be paying the price, guys and gals.
How will he pay price? He got reelected
Justin Trudeau has never paid a price in his life.
Ahahahah no he won't, he would've if Canadians had made this an issue **during the election less than 2 months ago**, but we didn't. JT will be fine until 2024 and by then his base will either accept this as "the new normal" or no longer care. 
Ofc I also fully expect the NDP and CPC to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory *again*, so I think he'll probably be in power until 2028.
But ya he'll totally "pay the price"
Justin Trudeau won't pay for shit. He will be fine. It is easy to borrow for future generations and fuck em over, as long as your PM you are fine lol

Well done Nova Scotia.  I wouldn't have expected us to be in the launch business, being so far from the equator's assist.
They haven't even broken ground yet, let alone had the required environmental assessment completed.
Remindme20years lolz
ok, thats cool!
It’s just a drawing.
[deleted]
Oh good, now we can give them more money. /s
Seriously, I hope NS politicians can see through this scam and treat these claims and grand plans with a truck load of salt.
The entire situation is extremely shady. It looks to me like the end game here is to make money from potential investors rather than launching rockets, and they're already fishing for government money.
This company had a very similar project involving the government of Brazil, which burned through a ton of money before being canned with no rockets launched. They're proposing building a rocket that has never been launched before, which is extremely difficult and costly, and the company behind it in Ukraine appears to be destitute.
Canso's about half way at 45 and that's about the best we can do - I'd agree though I'm surprised NS gets a spaceport. 
Congrats :D
So there's progressively better launches the farther from the poles we go?
Higher latitudes are better for certain kinds of orbits like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly\_elliptical\_orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highly_elliptical_orbit) and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-synchronous\_orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-synchronous_orbit)
The latter is usually slightly retrograde meaning you actually have to take off the rotation from your launch point.
You clearly don't subscribe to Elon-time.  It's next summer, at the latest.  Probably before the snow thaws........ /s
Yeah.  This announcement is Elon-time, Canuck style.
A scam?  Dammnit.  We will fall for that faster than if they tied a bag of rocks around our neck and tossed us in the ocean.
The province has so far stayed away from this. It’d be cool to have but without a major private investor it won’t happen.
The spaceport will be quite useful for polar orbits.
Niche
Very cool.  Thanks for this.
Except Elon actually has most of a spaceport and several Starship prototypes...NS has a picture of a spaceport.
TIL.  Cool.
Hehehehee........ damnit.  And here I was having so much fun imagining a spectacular taxpayer-infused boondoggle exploding rockets on the NS coast too......  /s
You are right.  This does sound like a confidence  game.  One that pols would love to be waist-deep in.
John Robson's article symbolizes the clueless, reactionary, radicalized right. Or at least reinforces the NP as a propaganda filled rag.
How incredibly pointless and reactionary
Did this guy really just use the word "spake"? 🤣
Ah yes in the long line of lawless left wing eco terrorists, like Alberta's own Wiebo Ludwig.  The fact right propaganda outlets in Canada would lump the Ludwg's in with the left as only the left would blow up pipelines (unlike the RCMP and Suncor, which have as well in an attempt to frame the Ludwigs) means we are in serious trouble if people are dumb enough to believe this crap.  https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/rcmp-bombed-oil-site-in-dirty-tricks-campaign-1.188599
It seems to me that terrorism is a bigger issue on the right than it is on the left. Perhaps NP should focus on the “lawless right” first.
Suzuki warned of danger, not threatened it.  
Right wing lacks comprehension
Highlights:
* David Suzuki said “there are going to be pipelines blown up if our leaders don’t pay attention to what’s going on.”  He was speaking at an Extinction Rebellion event and they routinely break the law because they can’t prevail in free votes.
* The idea that metaphorical violence justifies smashing people’s stinking faces has an enduring appeal to the viciously virtuous.
* Like those who storm platforms to assault speakers whose “words are violence.”
* Or the peaceful pipeline protestors on whom the authorities declared war for no better reason than stealing and vandalizing heavy machinery and destroying roads on which some grubby workers depend for oppressive luxuries like food and water.
* If you struggle with the notion that sticks and stones are a righteous response to names, you must be a deplorable. And while nobody is entirely innocent here, such logic has typically come from the left.
So if some right wing kook said that abortion clinics will be bombed, that's just a friendly warning? You'd be cool with that?

I’m genuinely curious if this could be considered evidence against the viability of Universal Basic Income — specifically, the common concern its critics tend to have about a significantly diminished workforce (i.e. if people are getting paid why would they want to work?).
Anyone here study this further that can shed more light?
Thanks taxpayers! It was a nice 2 years off, looks like it’s Time to go back to work now.
How surprising. Free money stops showing up and lazy freeloaders have to work like the rest of us have been doing the whole time.
I thought covid aid was done a while ago. Hmm.
I was reliably told by the progressive left that being paid to sit at home and not work was not a deterrent to seeking work! 
Those rascals fooled us again!
hopefully inflation will start to cool down, prices are crazy high even if you make above average
Oh so people look for jobs when the government stops paying people to not work? Who ever would have thought. 🤣
Ah yes, the $2200/month jobs where the average rent is $1500 + utilities. Really moving up in the world we are.
Anything above minimum wage still get a lot of applicants and a 2 year gap in your resume won't look as good against those who have no gap because they continued working...
Yes it’s a fair conclusion.  The pandemic has proven that people would rather make $2,000 per
month staying at home working 0 hours compared to working full time and making $2,500.   It doesn’t take a genius to figure it out but those arguing for UBI have  made similar arguments in the past.  It is apparent now.
After the pandemic, UBI is done and dusted in Canada.  Not to mention the government can’t afford it.
Yes it clearly can be and should be.
UBI proponents of course will claim otherwise. They will also ignore the massive inflation and insane debt.
They will totally promise UBI will be different. Scouts honour
CERB was a miniature experiment in what is basically basic income and its been a disaster for what pro UBI proponents have been arguing on the internet for a long time.
It destroyed a workforce.
It's unsustainable.
It helped rocket up inflation.
3 MAJOR arguments against UBI all 'proven'
Keep in mind this wasn’t a UBI since people lose their COVID benefits once they go back to work. My dad runs a small business and had to turn down tons of people that wanted to work under the table to keep their income off the books to keep their COVID benefits.
My question is, would we need UBI if wages actually covered the cost of living?  If people were given a fair wage for work and could cover their bills, would UBI be needed?
>i.e. if people are getting paid why would they want to work?
This is only relevant to the shitty jobs. The jobs we are told will be the first to automate anyway.
I'm not sure why a small uptick in job searches(the % of people looking for work went from 25 to 30%, including people already employed) would do that. Obviously there were some people getting government assistance that, now ending, are going to be looking to enter the labour market. First off, it's important to note that what we had during the pandemic wasn't a UBI. CERB and increases to EI weren't available to everyone and CERB was actually a very narrowly focused program. 
A lot of people in this thread seem to be confusing a UBI with simply a far more generous welfare program. If the argument against blanket 2,000 dollars a month for everyone who needed it(which again, is not a UBI which would go to everyone regardless of need) was that some people would take it and not work then I don't think that was ever really disputed. In fact, proponents of a much better welfare program tend to use that as an argument in favour of what they're advocating. The argument would be that society is probably better served by someone getting that 2,000 a month from not working and instead going to school or looking after their kids or elderly relative than it is someone working a minimum wage job. Likewise, the argument is that the result of those people leaving those jobs would be the people who were willing to work would see increased wages as competition for employees increases.
Now, I'm sure people who are actively against a more generous welfare program will say "But Cost! Inflation! Debt!" or whatever and fair enough, those are arguments to be made against it in a more comprehensive discussion of the subject but "If there's a generous welfare program, some people will use it" is not exactly a slam dunk piece of evidence against the people who advocate for it for that very reason.
Well for starters covid incentives were only given to people who lost their job or reduced hours because of covid. UBI would be given to everyone.
Not everyone is going to quit if UBI Is implemented, but certainly minimum wage and shit jobs of the sort would have to increase their wages.
UBI you would also increase tax on the rich to make room for.. which we did absolutely nothing of the sort.
It there's alot of propaganda to dismiss the concept without thinking about it in the slightest. Calling this a fair experiment and laughing it off all the way back to corporatocracy is something the rich would definitely want us to say.
Wealth is incredibly top heavy in Canada and could definitely use a shave. UBI would be a universally non discriminate way to give people more buying power and give them the ability to quit jobs that treat their employees unfairly without being "stuck".

What do you think people who were receiving covid relief were using it for?
Yeah they should had worked so they would make more at their minimum wage job, LOL.  
A huge increase from minimum wage to minimum wage.

> “From the Chief Medical Officers of Health, the likelihood that you have a medical exemption from a vaccination is one to five in 100,000. The Conservative Caucus is 119 people,” Holland said.
Using the more generous end of that estimate, the odds of 2 or more Conservative MPs having a legitimate exemption are 0.00174%, or 1 in ~57,000.
I preferred Andrea Horwath's "statistically curious".
> The process the House of Commons is using to verify the validity of those medical exemptions remains unclear.
The process of exempting anyone from the vaccine should be simple: require the exemption to come from a medical immunologist or other similar specialist. Anybody can shop around from GP to GP, until they find one willing to sign an exemption. But given the stated rarity of the situation, it would make perfect sense to have GPs refer their patients to a specialist, as is done for any other rare condition. Have the specialist certify if an exemption is appropriate or not.
Conservatives abusing medical exemptions so they don't have to get a vaccine? Is anyone surprised?
Thank god the CPC circus isn't running the country.
I'm so fucking sick of the Liberals but goddamn if the CPC doesn't put in the effort to be that much worse than the Libs every fucking time.
Fuckers.
Unfortunately anyone who has power and connections can get exemptions.    
There has to be a way of allowing only the valid but *extremely rare* medical exemptions, but damned if I know.
Anyone else noticing how deeply this pandemic has divided people against each other?
The cure to this would be to investigate the doctor,giving the exemptions. If they have acted in appropriately, suspend them.
Nobody should be surprised. A Tory telling the truth! Now that should surprise you!
Why it's *almost* as if caring about other people is just too much to expect from Conservative members of our elected government?
What a bunch of selfish assholes.
So let them get covid, see if I care.  The Herman Cain award awaits.  
I don't give two shits if people *allegedly* intelligent enough to be policy makers and decisions makers in our society get it due to their own stupidity and backwards ideology.
If we needed any more evidence that O'Toole is a spineless bald headed stooge, well now we have it. And the Cons wonder why they cant win the middle ground in federal elections.
Rules for thee not for me.
we dodged the bullet last election.
Worth every penny not to elect CONS.
ABC!
Wow. Just like Ford's government in Ontario. Weird. I wonder what chronic diseases they have that make their immune systems so compromised that they cannot get the vaccine. Bear in mind, I know for a fact that people who take immune suppressing drugs because they have had transplants and auto-immune diseases are allowed to get the vaccine. So whatever these MPs have, it must be some serious business....
Because I'm sure everyone has actually read this.
*"As a result, the number of Conservative MPs claiming to have an exemption also remains unclear."*
That's a good thing!  Hear me out.  
These guys think they are playing 5D chess in a 3D world... but are actually just playing checkers.   We're far too polite to let them know otherwise.
Most of us already know what's going to happen and how it'll end (r/HermanCainAward)!  It's just a matter if they are only nominated or get awarded.
Time will tell if they are 'incubated' or not.
Conservatives lie about anything and everything.
Fucking liars, the lot of them.
Whaddya know, the Tories are lying.
Guess that figures.
Not sure how this kind of lying is good for the country. Those are the sorts of lies politicians are supposed to tell. These lies seem rather self serving on the whole. Not a winning look.
Get your facking vaccines you loons!
so he's finally going to start thinking about considering to begin contemplating whether or not they should do something?
Our quality of life is about to start decreasing faster and further, along with our relevancy on world markets and exports.
All to save a miniscule amount of the world's emissions.
I will continue to tank our ability to compete with domestically produced goods while importing goods that are coming from countries not attempting to control their emissions rise without penalty.  If you aren't going to impose an import tariff from globally massive carbon sources, you just promote companies to outsource their manufacturing to those locations.
> Reintroduce legislation to regulate streaming and social-media companies that was stuck in the Senate when the election was triggered;
Probably still the first thing on their agenda, this seems more important to them than climate change.
Will he begin by cancelling his many vacations on government jets?  Perhaps this is the one time he might actually set an example?
Good, so where is the green economy, or is that just a fantasy since everyone is focused on the destruction of the carbon economy first?
Climate change is a huge threat but there’s very little growth in the green economy thus far, plus only one minister has spoken about nuclear.
I feel sorry for the tree that's been providing this man oxygen.
Trudeau & Co. wastes even more time and money on things that don't help Canadians in the slightest.
Talk is even cheaper now, a deflationary event.
Canada is in trouble. Trudeau is a dangerous idiot.
So when's he gonna propose a climate change bill that doesn't worsen our emissions?
It doesn't really matter what Trudeau *says*, does it? It never has.
I'm still waiting for every vote to count in elections, open & transparent government, women to actually get their promised and legislated equal pay for equal work, Indigenous reconciliation, effective climate heating measures, the end of oil and gas industry subsidies,  protection of Charter rights, a ban on testing cosmetics on animals, environmental protections that work, protection for women in the RCMP and the armed forces, etc.
As Greta Thunberg says, 'blah, blah, blah.'
Harder faster stronger.
Does this mean he's going to stop buying pipelines with tax payer money?
Bet.
There’s going to be a carbon tax on the carbon tax
That depends which province you're in.
Canadians are voting for it, I guess many are going to get what they’ve asked for.
Yep.
Don't forget that everyone's lifestyles are going to have to become more insular and the cost of living must raise for everyone................. except him.
But he already has two weeks booked at the Aga Khan's tropical getaway over Christmas break!
Curbing climate change might help us, though

Ottawa needs to make it illegal to smuggle handguns from the U.S.
This is absolutely ridiculous.
In Toronto, they have admitted that 80% of the guns recovered from crime are smuggled in from the USA.  Add to that some undoubtedly could not be traced, and the number of domestic firearms used is tiny.
Even the article talks about the increase in firearms trafficing, which has very very little to absolutely nothing to do with legal firearms owners.  Does she really think the killer in Montreal that shot a 16 year old was carrying a gun he bought at Cabela's that is registered to him?
Of course not.  But someone has to be punished, and currently the favourite target is legal gun owners.  Legal gun owners of handguns, btw, have to pass two safety courses, get permission from their spouse, go through a background check, pay and then wait to get their license, be a member of a gun club, and register their handguns and keep them securely locked up.  They are ONLY permitted to take them to the range and back (with very few exceptions).
Licensed gun owners are background checked every single day.  They have a murder rate less than 1/2 that of the general population. (Mauser, 2012, to a Parliamentary committee) despite being overwhelmingly male, all adult, and by definition having easy access to guns.
These people (anti-gunners) are so ideologically obsessed they are ignoring the real problem to abuse the innocent.
Outrageous.
Exactly how will banning law abiding citizens from owning handguns stop the flow of illegal handguns coming across the border??
Banning handguns for responsible gun owners won't stop criminals from importing them across the border.
We need better sentences for criminals.
They have a responsibility to ban alcohol as it is a much larger contributor to violent crime and death.
Here's a few good pieces of actual investitive journalism from Montreal. 
[https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2021/03/25/je-se-penche-sur-les-fusillades-dans-la-region-de-montreal?fbclid=IwAR0-ZUbNrNfXU-efrQHpbvM4oHoXfysjz4tNx2WGOswuq3b8ljapBrbr8UE](https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2021/03/25/je-se-penche-sur-les-fusillades-dans-la-region-de-montreal?fbclid=IwAR0-ZUbNrNfXU-efrQHpbvM4oHoXfysjz4tNx2WGOswuq3b8ljapBrbr8UE)

Here is a great example of how a handgun ban does not solve the problem, the mayor knows this and her argument is disingenuous at best. 
[https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/man-arrested-in-old-port-shooting-was-under-five-firearms-bans](https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/man-arrested-in-old-port-shooting-was-under-five-firearms-bans) 
"“I’ve talked about it a lot. I think there has to be more legal measures against owning any types of guns if you shouldn’t have one, but that’s something that is not in my hands,” Plante said." 
“But we need to continue to put pressure toward the government of Canada on that issue because I don’t think it should be a city-by-city kind of rule, I don’t have the capacity, ability or even the financial resources to make a specific law for my territory. Ultimately it’s something for the entire society, we don’t want people to walk around with guns.”
"The man arrested following the police shooting in the Old Port during the weekend does not appear to concern himself with firearm legislation. At the time of his arrest, he was subject to five different court-ordered firearms bans, including two lifetime prohibition orders."
“There are lots of things that can be done to convince young people not to take up guns, to not order them online.”
Ah yes Amazon’s one day shipping of Glocks has really just put too many handguns in the hands of teenagers. /s
Non-gun owners need to stop trying to make gun laws.
This is absolutely ridiculous.
In Toronto, they have admitted that 80% of the guns recovered from crime are smuggled in from the USA. Add to that some undoubtedly could not be traced, and the number of domestic firearms used is tiny.

Outrageous.
Well, government in this nation is completely based on pointless, ineffective, virtue signaling.  So banning handguns would really fit perfectly with what we do here.  It's pointless, it harms only legal gun owners, and handguns will still flood in from the USA to be used in crime.
Plante has an obligation to get the police working instead of directing traffic.
I love seeing people base their comments off emotion rather than coming to a logical conclusion from the facts. 
Saying "Nobody needs to own a handgun" etc shows a person's complete lack of understanding regarding firearms ownership in Canada.
The reality of the situation is that the legal use of handguns/firearms in general is not an issue within this country.
Here we go again. lol
Handguns are already illegal hence banned. What is making them double illegal going to accomplish? You need to to go after the gangs if want to stop the madness. Hard things are hard though.
You  think criminals are buying handguns legally?
Our laws don't even give us the right to use a handgun or a firearm as self defense. Therfore what is the point of owning one other then using it at a range?
Most crimes are committed with ghost guns (filed down numbers to make it a non existent firearm/untraceable)
I really see no problem with banning handguns, maybe they should focus on the real issue. "Illegal firearms"
As the rich get richer, the poor get poorer. Its a simple question, why would someone poor with nothing to lose use a handgun illegally in the first place? 🤔 
If there is a population with extreme poverty there will also be a demand for drugs: to replace isolation and a market for guns: to get funds to fund that isolation.
This isnt a problem you can solve unless you fix the economy firstly.
Good luck parliament.
It is buddy
100% the government can barely afford to buy my AR-15, there more handguns in private hands then scary looking rifle. Were is the money going to come from?
I think a change was just made to the matrix.
As awful as highlighting the idea of terrorism to a receptive audience?
If you don't have any problems with Suzuki 'observing' that people may start blowing up pipelines, then you also shouldn't have a problem with a politician on the other side making the same observation about abortion clinics.  
Either we live in a society where these kinds of 'observations' are tolerated, or we don't.  
Be consistent.
So they back Suzuki's call for terrorism ? Look how the left thinks it alright when they do it.
COVID-19 is an extremely simple problem with a known and extremely simple solution that is not only morally correct, but also far cheaper than any and all alternative non-solutions.
Look how we've done.
Climate change is an extremely complex problem with no known solution - at least not one that preserves industrial civilization - and certainly any conceivable solution to it would be complex and most likely expensive.
If anyone has any hope for humanity addressing climate change after having lived through COVID-19, then they must have gotten a severe case of brain damage from Long COVID.
Ah yes in the long line of lawless left wing eco terrorists, like Alberta's own Wiebo Ludwig. The fact right propaganda outlets in Canada would lump the Ludwg's in with the left as only the left would blow up pipelines (unlike the RCMP and Suncor, which have as well in an attempt to frame the Ludwigs) means we are in serious trouble if people are dumb enough to believe this crap. https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/rcmp-bombed-oil-site-in-dirty-tricks-campaign-1.188599
So typical. 
These are the people Kenney pals around with:
>W. Brett Wilson, a former “dragon” on CBC’s Dragons’ Den and current climate change skeptic who got a shoutout from the premier at last weekend’s UCP convention in Calgary, has repeatedly threatened environmental activists with hanging for “treason.” He tweeted  
 that Ecojustice, a Canadian environmental law charity with an office in  
 Alberta, should “watch your back.” And when given an opportunity to   
clarify whether his comments about hangings and treason were just a bad   
joke, Wilson doubled down. “I didn’t joke,” he tweeted. “I was serious about hanging foreign-funded protesters — undermining our nation — for treason.”   
>  
>So far, neither Kenney nor his environment minister has publicly   
criticized Wilson for his comments, much less tabled a resolution in the  
 legislature calling for him to be condemned as they have for Suzuki.   
Funny, that. 
Imagine that.
Is there any reason whatsoever to take any of these claims about Suzuki seriously?
Any at all?
There have been many bombings of pipelines previously, Suzuki was clearly just stating a fact when he said they will happen again. They most certainly will.
Well since the biggest group to blow up pipelines in Alberta were the RCMP, Suncor and the AB government in an attempt to frame Ludwig I guess we can list them as terrorists to eh?
When one of Kenney's buddies has talked about lynching eco protestors in the past, I think the idea here is less that there is nothing to criticize about Suzuki here, and more so that he has no moral ground to complain considering the company he keeps.
Yep. A cromulent observation.
The article may be hypocritical  but that doesn't take away from Susuki's "rules for thee but not for me" attitude and lifestyle.
If he's the best the green plan has for a spokes person, good luck with you agenda.
Gotta hang anyone that might get in the way of making more profit!
Sounds like encouragement, similar to the encouragement Trump gave to his supporters about marching down to capitol hill.
This would be like going to a KKK meeting and telling them that lynchings are going to happen.
He was speaking to an environmental extremist group here, not an anti-terrorism convention.
I will fully agree that both the UCP and Suzuki are awful.
But the reason that the UCP is awful is not because of criticism of Suzuki.
Sounds like he’s stating facts.
[removed]
yeah! Both are in my books.
No it’s the racists and fascists in their midst.
It’s not a fact if it hasn’t happened.
Quebec is both relieved and enraged their western oil meal ticket is pressing on.
Pitter patter, let's get at er.
That's great news! We need to get more projects moving as well. People need work.
This is the existing operating pipeline that's being referred to (and restart as in resuming operations, not resuming construction), not the twinning expansion. Or, when people say the government bought a pipeline for $10 billion, the pipeline they're technically correct about, even when they mean to put the entirety of that purchase cost to the new pipeline.
That's too bad, give it another couple weeks. Then do line 5 when it's cold.
Wasn’t this just being protested?
Should just leave it off. Oil should stay in the ground.
This record is on repeat…
Don’t bother.
It’s more important to build huge wind farms and solar farms in such enormous quantities to make a slight difference.
I wonder what the reaction of this sub will be once there's an environmental disaster from these pipelines. I mean, being as unbiased as possible, it is obvious there's going to be some sort of leak one way or another.
>People need work.
Yes they do, and we also need gasoline so we can get to work.
Every single drop is coming out of the ground to be sold.
You might be thinking of CGL, this pipeline was shut off due to the recent flooding in BC.
Well we need it so perhaps in a couple decadees
How are you accessing the internet today? Hypocrite.
What is?
Google pipelines across North America. You'd be shocked how many there are. Most don't leak. Hopefully there won't be issues with maintenance of the pipelines as it'll be needed.
The TM pipeline has been in operation since the fifties.  Very few leaks and nothing even close to an environmental disaster, and in all that time there has never been a tanker spill.
How are we to move oil around while we are transitioning away from it?
With electricity generated primarily through hydroelectric and nuclear power?

Some goverment websites here in qc make it almost impossible to find information in english, sometimes you have to search on a few sites for 5 mins or so before you realize theres no english section. Ive literally had to edit my url a few times to get info in english, and even then it doesnt always work.
Quebec hostility to English speakers is well established. See the CEO of Air Canada.
I'm bilingual but Quebec genuinely makes me hate the French language. Nothing they do inspires me to communicate in French or consume French content.
They don't want to call the black person a quebecker on top of that. That'll just give another reason for anglo folks to be even more racist towards them. Kinda goes against the purpose of the ad to begin with! /s
Wait till you try getting French-language info on an Alberta government web site.
I thought I was the only one that had that problem.  The French Canadians don't believe me when I tell them French Only pages are common enough.
(I checked through Ontario's Website to be fair - didn't find any English only pages - maybe they exist but certainly not in the most commonly used pages - French was available on all pages)
I mean, French is the official language of Quebec.
Edit: Downvoted for stating a simple fact.
r/Canada: We hate those entitled money-sucking overpaid CEOs.
(when that CEO publicly says he doesn't care about learning french in Québec)
r/Canada: God bless this Canadian patriot.
This is bonkers. Canada has two languages.  We started with two. Since 1763, we have committed to two. The Americans complained about it so much they put it into their Declaration of Independence as a reason, which we fought against. 
But then from 1839 to the final traces of Lord Durham’s policies being swept away in 1969, we operated under the official policy of London to make French Canadians second-class citizens in their own country, turn them into good little anglos, and ignore the promises made that life could continue with French Canadians as equals. A promise made at the birth of the country after the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, after a century of wars between the kings of Europe about whether God was Protestant and spoke English, or whether he was Catholic and spoke French. Here, we realized how stupid that was and thought we could try “equality” as a better way. 
Mutual respect was the way we put it in 1763, but then we ignored that promise from 1839 to 1969. So there were consequences, the most obvious being Quebecers finally free to ask themselves “Do we need to separate to be sure that never happens again?”  Twice they have said no, we should stay, and twice the people ignorant of history have condemned them as whiners and traitors for daring to even ask the question. It’s a fair question. I’m glad they said no, but someone was right to ask. 
There are less obvious consequences too, from the fact that you can’t just change a policy on one day in 1969, pat ourselves on the back, and say “Problem solved! Forget about it!” And while we can’t rewrite history the way we would now want it, with equality for 130 years instead of Lord Durham trying to contain French Canadians, replace them, or force them into an Anglo life, you can’t help but wonder what the country would be today if we had better judgment in 1839, and people were free to live as equals the way they were promised in the 1700’s. Manitoba would probably be bilingual or francophone. Much of the Atlantic.  The presence of French in all of Canada would be an everyday essential. 
And Quebecers would be as now the heart of French Canadian life, looking out at a country that from coast to coast to coast would remind them of a 250 yearold promise that had been kept, instead of a promise broken for 130 years, and then only restored for the last 50, with begrudging and sulking wing of the anglophone provinces whining about how terribly burdensome it all is and ignoring the obvious history of it. They can imagine that but we can all imagine what the world would be today if some injustice had never happened and we all realize including French Canadians that history is now written and no one will waste time on the past. It is only the future worth thinking about. And if Canada is a country that now once again and for all time accepts English and French equality, that dedicates itself to the good of both English Canadians and French Canadians, then we’re talking about a future in a practical way, and how to ensure that both our Canadian languages remain strong. 
And some dude heading up a major National corporation, a pillar of our industrial and business community, doing business in our greatest metropolis in the French-speaking parts of the country , saying “Yeah but French is kind of irrelevant for my job because I just make sure to hire anglos or francophones who did the learning for me so I don’t have to make the effort…” that’s not the future of the French language in this country, it’s the past of Lord Durham.
And either the rest of us see why that’s a problem, or we’re the ones dragging up the inequality of the past and telling Quebec that’s their future if they allow it.
Quebec is so hostile to Rousseau that during 15 years all francos switched to English to accomodate him…
Rousseau is a good example of a French family assimilated into English. A family that forgot its roots.
And what do you propose to inspire you ?
>I'm bilingual but Quebec genuinely makes me hate the French language. Nothing they do inspires me to communicate in French or consume French content.
This is the first comment for *every single* story here with the word *french* in the title. Every single one. Even if it has *nothing* to do with the content.
We get it Canada... you hate us. We get it.
Not an excuse but how many Anglophones in Quebec vs how many Francophones in Alberta? It's not apples to apples.
What's weird is a few times I've managed to get a site in english low and behold and top right of the page the words Français are there. So I click french the page turns to french, nowhere in the top right of the page does it say english after being turned into french. Its a joke sometimes.
Actually you're  entitled to receive information in english and french
So we have to bilingual for them but not the other way around?
Merci mon ami
Much like with other matters Canada had no qualms about reneging on their co-called "contracts".
When the province of Manitoba was formed in 1870 , most of the population was francophone and metis and there were constitutional protections given to public francophone education in the province. At the very *moment* that the demographic weight of protestant/anglophones surpassed that of the francophone/catholics in 1890 the Manitoba legislature declared that the province was unilingual and english and teaching in french public schools was abolished.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba\_Schools\_Question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba_Schools_Question)
Now Manitoba has about 3.7% francophones and the population has been in constant decline. But wait... although there are 3.7% of Manitobans with french as a mother tongue only 1.7% actually speak it regularly at home. Only 0.5% speak it exclusively at home.
In other words, the contract was broken a long time ago.

I don't want to talk bad about them, but I must.
They chose not to get vaccinated, she is morbidly obese, the most at risk and chose to "ride it out" like it was a rash or something.
And 
>Langan said his family was under the impression that people with COVID-19 were supposed to "ride it out at home" and avoid health facilities. He said no one told them differently and he had expected someone to check up on them
Where the fuck have they been for the last 2 years?   Everybody has been saying to go to the hospital when symptoms worsen..  since day 1.  They wernt under the impression of anything but their own made up delusions.
They paid the ultimate price for their own stupidity.   Hopefully others will learn from this.
Get vaccinated, get healthy.
19 months into this and they didn't know they should seek medical attention? I do feel for their children, finding a parent unresponsive is so traumatic.
There is a pretty similar trend in all of these younger people (under 60) who die of COVID-19. Most of them are obese. Obesity is one of the biggest preexisting conditions that can lead to complications and potentially hospitalization from COVID. Take extra precautions and make sure you get vaccinated if you're overweight.
Older widow two houses over has been waiting for hip surgery for over 3 years. Neighbours all chip in helping her with yard work, get groceries, etc.
I no long care about those who have been negligent and prolonged the pandemic and clogged up waiting times for the most vulnerable people.
An adult not getting vaccinated is like a drunk  who insists on driving when intoxicated. Not shedding any tears. The hope is they also don’t kill someone else.  Everyday Canadians with cancer, heart issues, etc go undiagnosed in a timely fashion because of selfish people.
Let me save you a click.
>...they had chosen not to get vaccinated because of what they had read on Facebook
>Langan said his family was under the impression that people with COVID-19 were supposed to "ride it out at home" and avoid health facilities. He said no one told them differently and he had expected someone to check up on them.
...What...?
When the "I have an immune system" crowd fail to realize their immune system isn't good enough if they're already at risk for being obese.
She was a sweet woman, who was a victim of social media algorithms. I only knew her from peavey mart, but she was very friendly and kind. This area is rife with this attitude. It’s extremely sad, and we’ve been fortunate to not have more cases like this given the local attitude concerning covid controls.
This is a really sad story and I feel for the kids but everything that happened was 100% preventable.
>After testing positive, the adults "faded fast," said Langan. Their children, ages 10 to 15, cooked and cared for each other **while the two adults couldn't move or eat.**
I mean... jesus christ...
This is just a friendly reminder to people that if you are ill...with anything...to such an extent that you can't get out of bed, pick up the phone and call the hospital and ask what they think you should do.
A non-vaccinated, obese person died of COVID...ok.  Surprised?  No.
As an obese person (by medical definition I guess) I did everything I possibly could to avoid getting sick, and that included vaccination as soon as possible.  It's not hard.
It seems like the CBC is trying to blame the government for their mistaken belief that they weren't supposed to go to the hospital if they got COVID.  The people in the article put a lot of blind faith into the government, but thought the vaccine was some sort of conspiracy.  Not much in the way of critical thinking skills there, IMO.
Health at any size
Some pretty harsh comments, which sadly are not untrue, please get vaccinated.
Ah yes, another able bodied, in great shape, unvaccinated human who thought they could ride it out. 
/s
> Langan said they had chosen not to get vaccinated because of what they had read on Facebook
Maybe someone reading this story on Reddit who is currently unvaccinated will (hopefully) learn from this and go get vaccinated.
What's the dad look like?
That’s just fucking sad. I hope the kids didn’t have to plan their mother’s funeral. Jesus fuck!!!
She looked healthy
While we are at it, why not have 10 different nations made for the 10 Canadian provinces!!! 🤷
I think we should have many areas that are a type of "nation within a nation." Obviously we would need to have some type of overarching government for the whole country because some policies would have effects that cross boarders, maybe we could call that larger government the "federal government". Then all these smaller nations within the larger nation could be called "provinces", or something like that, then they would need some type of "provincial government" to make decisions that affect their smaller jurisdiction.
wait.... I think this system might already exist
Why not Zoidberg?

Gonna pass on reading this.
This article:
* We shouldn't have "nations" within Canada.
* Quebec shouldn't be a nation
* Saskatchewan should be a nation
Friendly reminder that Nation and State are not the same thing. 
Nation: a large body of people united by common descent, history, culture, or language, inhabiting a particular country or territory.
So long as you ignore the fact that Saskatchewan is basically a creation of Confederation, whereas Quebec whose origins were in the explorations of Jacques Cartier four hundred years before Saskatchewan was even a province, whose inhabitants are French speaking and have a demonstrably different culture and even different legal system, well then sure, I guess Saskatchewan can be a "nation".
J J McCullough and his fake accent can fuck off. Downvoted.
Faites-le, donc?
What makes  sask unique?
A completely  different  language  then Canada  ?
Culture ?
Arts ?
Anything?
Why not, tant et aussi longtemps qu'elle prennent pas ma femme.
I vote Newfoundland.
* They were independent form Canada until the 1940s
* They have their own culture
* *They* don't speak English, either.
French Canadian isn’t a nation within Canada… it is the founding nation with the english canadian people at the time. Quebec is 200 older than Canada.
English Canada was built for english Canadian… The french canadian have Quebec.
Alright who’s gonna explain to moe that voting differently then the GTA is not a unique cultural identity
As a Quebecois,
If the population of Saskatchewan desires to be a nation within a nation, why not?
A fact that most Canadians don’t realize is that the provinces do have an incredible amount of sovereignty, way more than US states. Canada has real internal trade barriers. Really astonishing.
I’ve always found it a bit funny that the US has this big idea of themselves as a federation of independent states, when Canada is actually much closer to this reality.
>The right to self-determination is the right of a people to determine its own destiny. In particular, the principle allows a people to choose its own political status and to determine its own form of economic, cultural and social development.
The guy who wrote the article looks like he's about 19, and put a lot of words together in grammatically passable sequence in order to say, "I don't understand why Quebec is so distinct, but <Saskatchewan politics>."
Hey the lower mainland in BC separated from Canada last week. Catch up Quebec and Saskatchewan.
Edit: and we promptly ran out of gas so it really is like Brexit.
At a time when the country should be doing its best to pull tighter together, everyone wants to go separate ways. Fuck sakes.
Isn't BC perpetually waiting for the earthquake that cleaves it off into the Pacific?
The extreme weather events BC, Canada, and the rest of the world are enduring were predicted. Of course, not exact time and place. But predicted generally. And, generally, too, the warnings were ignored.
The general pattern is people, countries, and communities do not do what's required to prepare for climate heating driven extreme weather events until after thousands of people's lives, homes, and livelihoods have been destroyed.
Going forward, once-in-a-century weather events will happen annually, and likely many times during the year. We can be confident now that BC and other parts of Canada will have another wildfire season. We can be confident, too, BC will be hit by more atmospheric rivers and massive flooding. 
All the conditions that cause these weather events will be extant in 2022 and will worsen until the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere drops to about 350ppm. There doesn't appear to be sufficient political, economic, or social will to do that. 
If history is prologue, Cassandra will be ignored, until Chaos joins with her.
It's called a 200 floodplain basin for a reason.
At this point, it's clear that there won't be much or any prevention put in place for natural disasters. Especially poor areas. 
Are you at risk of another 'once in a lifetime event'? If you knew one was coming how would you prepare or what would you do differently?
I wonder what the plan is for New York as one of a million examples with cities directly on the water in the clear path of steadily rising sea levels.
I'm so glad I live in the boring, bureaucratic hell that is Ontario.
I have lived on Vancouver Island nearly 30 years and gotta be honest I really didn’t consider a situation where simple RAIN could fuck shit up like it has. Because it fucking rains here, a lot, we have big storms, it rains for days normally and flooding is very rare unless someone does something like block a drainage ditch etc. SO saying someone was warned we could get enough rain to do this damage is weird to hear, ya o guess people understood there COULD be too much rain but until it happens it’s really hard to grasp.
It’s kind of ironic that BC is the greenest province, yet Mother Nature is really fucking their shit up.
I have been hearing these warnings since the 60s. Only blaming the current flock seems like a huge lie.
From the article:
>But his government has a shelf full of contemporary reports from experts, warning that disasters like this are going to hit with greater frequency and with bigger impact, and that the province is not prepared.
>B.C.’s auditor-general, Carol Bellringer, cautioned in a February, 2018, report that the provincial government “may not be able to manage flood risks given a number of factors including a lack of staffing and technical capacity, outdated flood-plain maps, and roles and responsibilities that are spread out across many agencies and levels of government. Similarly, government’s wildfire prevention activities are not sufficient, and to date, have not substantially reduced the risk.”
>In 2019, a preliminary report on climate-change risks to the province highlighted the threat of wildfires and flooding – among others – and warned that the majority of risk events would have “catastrophic” economic consequences.
>Similar studies from academics and environmental organizations have piled up, each urging the province to prepare for catastrophic events related to climate change. Just this spring, a report by the Fraser Basin Council specifically warned that the province’s model for managing flood risk is broken. “The province continues to face damages, losses and misery associated with flood events, and the system clearly breaks down on best practice principles for good governance.”
I feel like this is true of any infrastructure - "we warned you 10 years ago \*bad thing\* would happen" The problem just gets kicked down the road.
Politicians do what politicians do.
Imagine what'll happen when floods and heatwaves become so severe and common that entire towns full of homes and businesses become literally uninsurable. 
And I'll still probably get called a NIMBY for opposing yet more irresponsible development...
Wow, as a life long resident of BC, no one ever told me  about an atmospheric river turning the southern half of the province to mush.
I knew the asshat ‘I told you so’ articles were coming, but it’s BS.  We’ve been warned about earthquakes and so on, but this type of flooding was not on the radar.
[deleted]
Atmospheric rivers are going to get **worse** and **worse** until we take the carbon out of the atmosphere.
Maybe Vancouver City should put some effort into improving dykes and the seawall. The climate emergency plan doesn't seem to address what is already happening.
BC is putting its head in the sand when it comes to planning for KNOWN global warming disasters.
It's the only way it can continue to expand the natural gas industry and not look like a bunch of fucking hypocrites.
I'm reminded of the story of the man who fell off a 10 story building. As he passed the 3rd floor, he was heard saying, "So far, so good."
It's supposed to flood and destroy Richmond, surrounded by water and built at sea level atop a drained swamp. But because of these fears, they've been heavily invested in flood protection works and were actually not really impacted by recent flooding at all. Just shows what investment into infrastructure can do.
The major fault line is in the pacific ocean.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayward\_Fault\_Zone#/media/File:PlateMovementEaNoPac.png](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayward_Fault_Zone#/media/File:PlateMovementEaNoPac.png)
Coastal California is what people say will fall into the ocean. I don't know if there is any science behind that.
lmao at the idea prices will go back down, also lmao that wages will increase to compensate
Let me tell you my perspective from someone that work in agriculture and follows the policies and macro events closely:
Every year, we come closer and closer to a real food crisis. I'm talking one that most of us, including myself have never experienced.
The entire global food system has been in a race to the bottom for decades, basically since the end of WW2. Everything has become incredibly centralized and efficient, at the expense of exploiting the workers in those systems and those systems being incredibly fragile to disruption.
Our current food systems are not set up to withstand the events that are happening today. Here's what the past few years have been for farmers:
Railway strike
Railway blockades
Product bans from China due to the Huawei situation
Trade wars with the US and China
COVID
Massive draught (Prairies)
Massive flood (BC)
Both that drought and that flood are going to have long-term impacts on our food supplies and food security. It takes years to build up herds back to their former strength.
So yeah, food prices are going up, and that's the LEAST of our worries with food. Follow agricultural news if you want a front-row on the people being fucked the hardest by climate change.
Better in the sense that instead of sprinting towards that cliff, we will be leisurely jogging.
food costs always go up
So gets better would imply that the prices would drop after a brief period of situational and or market demands that are seasonal or localized.  But prices won’t go back done once they have gone up.
Prices don't go down. They go up, wages don't.
I was talking to one of our suppliers today at work, and he told us he's expecting prices to go up 15% next year. Luckily I dont work in the food industry
I hope people are not dimwits and recognize that prices will not go down. Prices for goods will just increase at a slower rate……
GET BETTER? Ha!
You should know the **inflation is in fact way higher right now** and will even shoot NORTH in Feb of 2022.
&#x200B;
>**inflation** rate reached **4.7**
What do you mean MAY?  Why is the media so entirely dishonest on this issue?
Nothing ever gets better. It just becomes the new normal. Or it just gets worse.
talking about vertical farming is still a faux pas for Canadian sustainable food practices.
shit took almost 20 years just to get almond protein - one if the least sustainable - to be a regular in market.
I couldn't even get our print company to consider reaching out for insect protein flour companies when they wanted all ideas for growth on the table.  (parent company absorbed them years ago.)
WOW, more good news! /s
LOL it's not going to get better.
News flash. They ain't going back down....
Buy Bitcoin to protect yourself from inflation, do some research.
Why don’t people buy what they need and cut out the mass consumption? you think maybe mass consumption is the problem? The middle needs to take back the world by holding their money tightly.
\> also lmao that wages will increase to compensate
Supply and demand. They will have no choice but to increases wages. Unless of course our government decided to use immigration to suppress wage growth, but our political parties would never do something so craven.
What if we add more immigrants, surely that will put downward pressure on home prices and upward pressure on wages?
Prices going down don't make nearly as much news as going up.
How about addressing the rasing cost of living? Hospital protest bans are a provincial thing and most provinces already have laws about that. Stop distracting and start governing please.
I don't really care about the hospital stuff, but man, if they can nail down $10 childcare and paid sick leave before Christmas, that would be amazing. Those are big ticket legacy items that actually help tons of regular people.
Please keep federal laws from overstepping on provincial jurisdiction, and this law would effect unions (not that a more righteous reason makes it any better) more than the anti-vac groups it’s meant to fight.
Can we add railways to the list?
This is some shitty bread and circus.
There are already laws that cover blocking access to a hospital.
Remember when we had that election because of all the urgent work that needed to be done in Parliament?
Trudeau: go ahead and block off our country's oil pipelines on private property and exports which cost Canadians billions 
Also trudeau: under no circumstances can you protest vaccines 
 I'm being sarcastic, but this was predictable.
This is a direct attack on the rights of Conservative Anti-vaxxers!
Edit> I'm glad about all the downvotes. It's important to know that despite O'Toole's lies, they are the anti-vaxxer party and their aim is to conserve covid as long as possible.
Please don't forget next election which party is responsible for prolonging the pandemic.
We got what we voted for.
This is governing, doing multiple things at once.  Just because one planned is announced, doesn't mean other things are not being worked on or researched into.  This isn't distracting, this is politics and frankly, how businesses work too.
>How about addressing the raising cost of living?
People keep screaming this but I want to know how? How would you get this under control and force manufacturers to lower their pricing? As for for housing such as rent...
"Premier of Ontario **Doug Ford's Conservative Government** enacted legislation in 2018 such that rent control only applies to rental units created and occupied prior to November 15, 2018. It does not apply to new buildings, additions to existing buildings and most new basement apartments that are occupied for the first time for residential purposes after November 15, 2018."
Thank the provincial conservatives for this, not the feds. Doug Ford also killed the minimum wage increase to $15 three years ago. 
But seriously, what's the cost of living silver bullet that can save us from this? I don't see it.
You know the government can do more than one thing at a time, right?
Why would Trudeau do that? How does that help him prétend to care?
$10 childcare is a happening for most of the country, the only holdouts are Ontario and I think NB and I would bet dollars to doughnuts it's because of resistance on the provincial end, not the Federal one.
It's only in federally mandated workplaces for sick leave
How about we ban internet speech instead?
"Mandating a 10-day sick leave for all workers in federally regulated workplaces will also be among the four key focuses for the government..."
JFC, read the article instead of automatically assuming. This will only apply to federally regulated workplaces which, you guessed it, the federal government actually has control over.
How do either of these priorities step on provincial jurisdiction?
No no, this is Canada. First Nations persons can disrupt any type of infrastructure at any time for any reason without repercussion.
Yeah. Ain't it great?
Bubble bubble bubble. Everyone is a millionaire in Canada with 100k household income! Once the access to capital get shut off through increased interest rates people who bought at the tail end will get killed. People with multiple mortgages will get killed.
“People basically say, ‘Okay, interest rates are rising. I want to get into the market now before it's too late,’ 
Who is saying they want to get into this market before it's too late? I think they're a little late with that statement.
Waiting patiently for shit to go down
“Oh no! Prices about to plummet (if rates rise). Better lock in my purchase price now!
All these armchair economists are missing the point.
It’s not the interest rates or the housing prices that matter to people, but rather housing affordability. Housing affordability is a function of real incomes, rates, and housing prices. 
For example, prices can go up but interest rates can go down such that it makes owning a house more affordable. Or prices and rates can remain unchanged but real incomes can stagnate in the face of inflation and that can make housing less affordable. These variables can shift in opposite directions and at different magnitudes.
People are seeing their real incomes stagnate in the face of inflation and expect rates to rise with little expectation of supply/demand shifting and thus they don’t expect prices to go down. What the buyers are saying is “I can afford X house now, and next year I expect to be able to afford less than X; I need to jump in right now”. And it’s a totally rational line of thinking (especially with fixed 5 year rates). They’re not necessarily banking on house prices going up. They are driven by the other two variables in that equation.
Flag this under Captain Obvious.
I'd much rather buy after rate hikes than before. I'm not sure why they're racing. I'm the opposite -- getting tired of waiting; the rate hikes can't possibly come soon enough.
3 properties final term this quarter, each mortgage is 70% of the charged rent.
Enjoy paying for my retirement as your rent goes up. The BC way.
I fucking love Canadian politicians who protect me.
Wont pay my rent? The 600,000 new permanent residents next year will. While buying more property than you have every 30 years  *every* year.. Go live on the streets.
lol. Losers.
>People with multiple mortgages will get killed.
don't tempt me with a good time

>People with multiple mortgages will get killed.
Let me find my tiny violin
[deleted]
Oh well
The rate increases aren’t going to be nearly enough to cool the market.  They may let a little air out of the balloon, but it will be too little to have any real effect.
Prices won't plummet if rates fall though. We are still woefully short on supply and we are only bringing in more new canadians to make that issue worse.
House prices may not keep screaming up, but essentially anyone buying after the hike will be paying the same price with a more expensive mortgage.
Hard to predict the future, and a lot of FOMO in the housing market that may or may not turn out to be justified. Waiting a year may mean paying higher rates and still paying 5% more purchase price on top.
In a lot of markets, prices don't really fall, they just plateau for a while. But rates in North Battleford are the rates in East York. 
I'm in Ottawa, and I think the last price drop we had was in the mid 90s, lasted a couple years, and at it's worst they fell like 1.6%. But in that time, we've also had a number of years when they're gone up 20-25%.
A lot of people are buying with low % down and are much more sensitive to rates than nominal house prices.
I'm in a similar situation as you but I have no idea why you think this way. 
How barren is your life that you're still so miserable even with these financial comforts?
My body is ready.

If I understand the article correctly this is about debating the impacts of climate change.  It’s not about passing legislation to help those impacted by the flood.
It’s an important issue, why does it need an emergency debate though?
They are going to have to fix strata insurance. It is a total mess, because stratas are required by law to insure their properties, but finding insurance companies willing to insure risky buildings is getting much more difficult and stratas are getting really taken to the cleaners.
I think the federal government is going to need to produce a "public option" for strata insurance against climate risks like floods. They can leverage their offer to require upgrades to heating, cooling, insulation efficiency and others as required by their longer term climate plan.
And say what? Debate what?
"Floods are bad, well if we were in power the floods wouldnt dar challenge us"
"Our weak PM has made us victim to the whims of the floods"
I hope the debate will have a resolution that all drained lakes should not be built on.
If it's not happening in Ontario, the government does not care
Nah. Emergencies don’t happen in Canada, only severely reactive government responses occur in this failing country. Just wait till the bills hit alongside the inflation.
Interestingly Trudeau has been very active on green issues.  He put an end to the pipelines, through incompetency, and added a monster carbon tax.  Not sure any other party would do that.
It allows the opposition to get all their talking points against the Liberals in.  This emergency debate is really useless
Climate change is an emergency
So why should taxpayers of the rest of the country insure those stratas?
Nah you gotta make it more simple than that.
"Since Justin Trudeau has come into power, Natural Disasters have increased 76.8%" 
(I made that number up btw. If for whatever reason Im right it is pure coincidence).
An end to the pipeline that's currently being built through BC that goes directly through where all the mudslides just happened?
Monster carbon tax?  Exaggerate much?
Which pipeline did he put an end to? Has Alberta's oil exports decreased even a barrel during Trudeau's government?
I know the answer. And I know that you don't know the answer but just like to "hurr durr Trudeau bad". Hint: oil production hasn't dropped one iota except perhaps with the recent mudslides. The pipelines that aren't getting built (largely not the Canadian governments fault) aren't about \_maintaining\_ the status quo. They have always been about \_expanding\_ production. You know, increasing the rate that Alberta's oil and are contributing to the carbon problem.
But, either you don't know that because you are a moron, or you're jut a liar.
And why should we encourage risky building practices like building on floodplains?
Economy of scale might be cheaper for Canadians overall. We're all paying for climate disasters right now anyway (look at the relief funds that are coming to Merritt, Abbotsford, and Princeton). It allows influence on the strata counsel decisions to enact are policies such as switching from fossil fuel heating or other.
It's kinda the same argument as universal health care.
“We unanimously condemn the mudslides that happened under JT’s watch” 🙄
Yup
The one they bought, then haven't done anything with it
The pipeline they bought is trans mountain and it’s been operational since the before and after the LPC bought it.  They also bought the rights the build trans mountain expansion, and billions of dollars have been been spent on construction since it was purchased by the LPC, and continue to spent. It’s supposed to be operational by early 2023. 
Why are you trying to spread lies?
"I'm press"
"K. You're still breaking the law."
*Justice Marguerite Church of the Supreme Court of B.C., in Prince George, said she would release Amber Bracken from custody after the photojournalist agreed to comply with the terms of an injunction intended to keep protestors away from the construction of the Coastal GasLink pipeline.*
Rumor on the interwebs is that was the reason they where not released sooner because they refused to sign.
*Bracken's lawyer, David Sutherland, took issue with the company lawyer's contention that neither of the journalists had identified themselves as media immediately and were "crossing the line between being media and being protesters."*
He said she said and probably the truth is somewhere in the murky middle 
*"She was labelled on her body as press," said Sutherland, who said Bracken had pinned to her body a copy of an assignment letter from The Narwhal, the publication that hired her to cover the situation.*
How hard with this be to fake not very and the cops don't know until they verify
*"Amber Bracken told me she was labelled as press and identified herself as press ... so there's no breach of the injunction at all."*
I mean thats not really how it works you identifying yourself as press does not give you the right to not follow cop instructions. Also have seen people labeled as press and that identify themselves as press interfere pretty badly with the cops
> Both are required to return to court Feb. 14, 2022 for a hearing related to allegations of civil contempt of court.
If the journalists were as squeaky clean as some folks want to portray them, I'm not sure they'd have been held and given a court date.  It sounds like the prosecution isn't buying their story that they're simply neutral observers.
Wet'suwet'en needs to have a referendum to decide once and for all whether to give jurisdiction over land rights to the hereditary chiefs or the band council.
Judges aren't holding domestic abusers, drug dealers, thieves etc in jail, why would they hold a protestor in jail lol.... this is a non story.
Why did it take a judge? Should have been let go as soon as credentials were presented
*(...after they agreed to comply with the terms of an injunction intended to keep protesters away "*
But this is the whole point.  They are not protesters, they are news media reporting on the protests.
By forcing them to agree to this is tantamount to giving the arrests of these two by the RCMP legitimacy.
WTF is wrong with EVERYONE ?
The rcmp should be held responsible for infringing on press freedom. They’ve done it time and time again.
I highly doubt they didn’t identify as press especially when they got “PRESS” written on them.
Being present to observe is not breaking the law. The police aren’t allowed to just make them go away so they can do what they want without being recorded.
Edit: people hate the press that much eh? The world would be a much worse place should they not exist.
Tell me you don't understand what police misconduct is without telling me you don't know what police misconduct is.
I believe that there were 3 journalists arrested; 1 on Thursday and 2 on Friday. The 1 on Thursday was released the same day without charges and is a huge issue imo.
The other 2 were arrested on Friday after locking themselves in a hut with 6 protestors. The @Gidimten Twitter said that police told them to come out and ended up using an axe to break down the door. That blatantly crosses the line between journalist and protestor imo and should be prosecuted if only to set precedent on what is allowed and what isn’t.
> How hard with this be to fake not very and the cops don't know until they verify
She has a photo in her twitter account of the "press credentials" that she printed and taped to either herself or her gear with blue tuck tape.  She claims she didn't think to bring the credentials the Narwhal had supplied her because she wasn't expecting any enforcement action, which is not very smart.
https://twitter.com/photobracken/status/1461158385181675529?s=20
It's not hard to see how police would question the validity of those credentials.
They aren’t required to be neutral btw. Only not participate actively in illegal activity. The charges will be dropped unless they have direct evidence of them doing something active. The rcmp are most likely just abusing their authority yet again.
They kind of already did, though. They have elections for band council. The populace consistently votes in band councils that are PRO pipeline. If the people wanted to support these protesters, they'd vote in a council and chief that are anti-pipeline.
I think the hereditary chiefs wouldn’t participate or ignore the results anyways
A reporter is not a protester.
This sub is lousy with right-wing bootlickers.
I have a nasa shirt but I definitely don't work there.
>especially when they got “PRESS” written on them.
Neither of the two journalists had press written on them.  Both of them have already come out and said exactly that.  Why are you trying to lie about the facts here?

Entire industries decimated.  But 30 public servants having to find a new job is a fucking news story.
Wait? A politician lied? Better mark this monumental event on the calendar. One day I'll tell my kids about this event
/sssssssssssssss very sarcastic
Regardless about how you feel about vaccine mandates, he also promised not to do those too. His promises mean nothing. His yes means no.
What kind of inspectors?
There's been a lot of cuts to the Ministry of Labour and their enforcement capabilities.  It's almost like Doug Ford just doesn't want labour law in Ontario to be enforced.
I like the Ministry of Labour.  When I was a teenager, Bulk Barn tried to stiff me my last paycheque.  All I had to do was fill out a form online and the government sent some goons to scare a cheque out of the store owner.
Jesus Christ.  Three months ago, my employer (auto parts mfg) hired around 20 new people and got them trained.  A month and a half ago, due to the semiconducter chip shortage, they had to let them all go along with a dozen others.  They didn't want to lay them off, they did it because they had no choice.  That's one little (okay medium sized) employer in one medium city.
Mean while, 30 overpaid civil servants provincewide get laid off, and they get a friggin' news story about it?  Oh wait... this article is from the Council for Bolshevism in Canada (CBC), and Dougie is a Conservative.  Now it makes sense.
Some politicians just do things, good and bad, honesty in their good/evil.
Some politicians say they will do good things but really intend to do bad things.
Ford is the latter type. So is Kenney. So is Moe. Almost seems like the team they play for has an honesty problem.
Nobody seems concerned that a conservative premier is laying off inspectors and telling us the function will be achieved by another means.  This is what corruption looks like folks.  I’m not saying this is definitely corruption but this is what it normally looks like here.  If those jobs are being done under contract to some private sector company on fords donor list before the next election then you know it is.  If you see fewer qualified tradespeople or more TFWs on construction projects in the next year or two you will know it is.
Has Doug Ford ever told the truth lmao
I read skimmed through the article, but I didn’t see anything written about what the government had to say about this or if the cbc tried reaching out to Ford administration.
Looks to be a slanted article, but as I said I skimmed the article, so I might have missed it.
Its not like anything bad will happen

I miss Rob "I have plenty to eat at home, thanks" Ford.
Sorry, if you believed Doug Ford would make anything better, then you’re an idiot
Doug Ford’s word is meaningless.
It begins...
Not 30 overpaid government workers!
Sorry you guys are out of work but fuck the Ontario college of trades. Just another bureaucracy taking money from working folks and providing zero in return
Headline! Tub of shit known for lying behaves like a lying tub of shit! Side note- he's so offensively ugly I really wish they'd stop with the pictures.

It's hard to keep up with facts. On one hand all these doctors and scientists say it's safe, but then you got these truck drivers who say otherwise.
On vaccines, I ask my doctor 2 questions:
1. Can it help me? 
2. Is the government paying?
If the answers to these are both yes, then . . . oh wait, my sleeve is rolled up.
If I refused to have something I don't fully understand my milk would constantly spoil due to the lack of fridge.
Also insert joke about the opposite sex here depending on which it is for you.
I don't understand these stupid people. How is this even a choice? Just get vaccinated.
I imagine that as time goes on, more and more employers are going to require Covid vaccination.
Time to bring in self-driving trucks to replace them lol
An argument one of them makes in the article:
> “Are you going to ask drivers to pull out their phones to show their proof of vaccination?” he said. “The delays will be enormous.”
Lol what? We already have to get our passports/NEXUS cards ready to show to border guards at the border, pulling up a QR code on our phone wouldn't take much longer. Has he never had to wait in a lineup at the border? We have lots of time to begin with to get all the documents needed before we pull up to the border guards. And regardless, I guarantee it would be faster for someone to bring up their QR code on their phone than to find their passport anyway!
It's literally a non-argument, but then again, so is pretty much every one of their "arguments".
umm and, i need to get vaccinated so i can fly, that i need for work as well.
&#x200B;
Soooooooo, point being?
So playing chicken with the supply chain. This should get interesting.
[removed]
When it was announced, my local newspaper tried talking to a bunch of transport companies that did US transport. The one out of seven that replied said he lost 1 driver out of 15 to this, every other one has at least their first dose. 
I don't think we'll see a lot of drivers just leave the business. Won't make much of a difference in the current market.
I had to choose, too. Have the government inject me with a slurry I don't understand, or risk my job and be denied access to movies and sporting events. I chose the vaccine. Because it fucking saves lives.
Wtf is the matter with some people?
>“The reality is, we’re playing a game of high-stakes chicken with the situation the supply chain is in right now,” said Steve Laskowski, president of the CTA, which is pushing for the U.S. to delay the mandate to give the industry more time to improve vaccination rates. “There are no backup drivers to draw from.”
They have literally had MONTHS to do that. Fuck em.
Another rocket surgeon who "did his own research" about the safety and efficacy of vaccines: in fiteen minute sessions, with his pants around his ankles and the cat curled up in his jockeys.
Likely hasn't figured out why he keeps getting pinkeye, either.
What a travesty....anyways.
I was actually talking to a friend about this over the weekend who is a truck driver and the overwhelming philosophy is they don't like being told what to do so they aren't getting it. Sure plenty believe the conspiracy theories but others are okay with getting the shot but only if its on their own accord. They fully acknowledge they are risking a pay cut and potentially employment but the principle of independence is worth more than their finances, jobs and health. 
I'll keep that freedom in mind when I have to wear a mask for all these extra months, fear more of my elderly relatives dying and now have go deal with empty shelves in grocery stores too.
It's just a vaccine bro what's the big deal
Be protected against a virus AND get to work in the US or have no protection against a virus AND have your livelihood jeopardized.
Tough choice for some.
This will surely help the supply chain problem!
Next they're going to be invading my medical history by demanding I wear glasses when I drive.
This truly is a brave new 1994, big brother was right. Orson Gorwell is watching us!
How did they fix the one part where there was nothing left below the tracks so quickly. Wow
Imagine boxing day morning, when they are about to open the doors, but with trains.  That's what is coming.
With enough money, manpower and pressure anything is possible.
How? They don’t fuck around. People assessing the damage, planning, design the solution, and working on construction 24/7 is how this shit gets done so quickly. Railroads are cash flow generating machines, and they cannot be down for literally a second longer than humanly possible.
If only the government had the same eagerness to get the highway done with the same amount of conviction…
They dump loads and loads of rock
I'm sure they didn't need to fix that part yet, the train can probably go over it fine.
It’s easier to repair and get a rail line back online than a road... 
And there are temporary steel bridges waiting on the coq to be instead when able to.
Canadian regulatory authorities are deeply afraid of doing their job re: Antitrust legislation. The one small change in Canada that could have profound impact is to actually start chopping up our landed elite oligopoly made up of powerful families and conglamorates, as they do the most damage to Canada's economic efficiency and social progress. They steal from consumers through squeezing quality of life and capture our politicians.
They should rip the big three apart
We are literally using our tax dollars to keep these fucks on top.
Rogers - and other wireless companies like Bell and Telus - is nothing but a cash hoarder at this point. 
The worst part, primary factor in their monopolization of the market is the Government. 
And good prof says it without a hint of irony
> "The regulator has to look at whether … the benefit to the shareholders outweighs the cost," 
lmao - "benefit to the shareholders"... now, that's magic, none of that abracadabra shit
Please standby for a price increase!  5 - 4 - 3 - 2  ....
Yay even less competition in our telecom space. It would be bad to have innovation in tech in Canada. It's not like telecom is important... /S
Getting sick of this shit.
Not only should CRTC block this merger, the CRTC should ban content creators from being able to own content delivery infrastructure.  
When things are already to big, you don't let them merge further, you split them up!
If you think a company can make a $26Billion dollar purchase without raising prices all around, you are high.
This needs to be stopped.
Man I really hope this deal gets rejected. It's not looking good though
After the Succession-like drama with the Rogers family, this thing should be rejected with extreme prejudice. The last thing Ed Rogers needs is more Canadian telecom under his fingers.
I'll be live at the CRTC hearings all week long.
How is this by any means a functioning capitalist system? This is literally the opposite of competition.
The old Roger's ceo was set to earn up to 200 million.
Yea the users are getting screwed
Yeah just what we need, to get fucked even harder by cell phone providers.
*Edward Rogers, now again back in charge as chair of Rogers Communications Inc., said, “this deal will benefit our* *~~shareholders~~* *customers and our future. It should, and it does, provide strong benefits to* *~~shareholders and my family~~*  *Canada. Rogers is proud of* *~~robbing Canadians~~* *meeting our commitments  for over 60 years. I pledge that Rogers will continue to* *~~fukc Canadians~~* *do so.”*
*Ted Woodhead, Rogers’ Senior Vice President, Regulatory, concluded, “approving our application will serve the* *~~shareholders'~~* *public interest and will, ultimately, help ensure that Canada’s broadcasting policy objectives will be achieved in a rapidly evolving environment.”“By bringing our two companies together we will make more* *~~$$~~* *possible and provide a brighter future for* *~~shareholders~~* *Canadians and* *~~my family~~* *our country,” added Woodhead.*
*~~WindMobile / Freedom Mobile was always the clear and present danger selling so much data and then unlimited data so cheap. So, we asked Shaw to take over FM and promised we would take care of them in couple of years. We also agreed Bell to take over Telus next year. Frankly, in Canada, 2 providers is more than enough. Too much work meeting each other before raising our prices together.~~*
I have absolutely no faith in the CRTC. This is coming from someone who has formerly worked in the telecom industry. They more so protect the telecoms and gouge the people. We need to axe the CRTC and create a better regulatory body for these companies. Our mobile data and internet prices are absolutely rip offs.
Anti-trust.
I really wish they would do what New Zealand regulator and also European and Australian regulators realized. 
Telecom infrastructure is a natural monopoly but telecom services are not. But when the company which owns infrastructure is also allowed to offer services the latter becomes a monopoly as well. Largely because there are only so many lines you can run to a person's house (i.e. the last mile). 
So they broke them up. Now you one one company which owns the last mile infrastructure and is prohibited from offering end user services and many companies which operate like Teksavvy and lease last mile. Every service company has its own back end they just lease space for the last mile. 
I'll use New Zealand as the example since it's the simplest. New Zealand had one company: New Zealand telecom which offers all internet services in New Zealand. But in 2008 when it wanted to roll out fibre optic network they forced them split into two companies: [Spark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorus_Limited?wprov=sfla1) which provided services and [Chorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorus_Limited?wprov=sfla1) which owned the infrastructure. 
But here is what's key Chorus not only cannot offer end user services they cannot give privileged access to Spark or any other company. Every company in New Zealand that can provide telecom services is entitled to access Chorus network. 
Since the break up they gone from one company providing ISP services to [14 in Auckland alone](https://www.broadbandcompare.co.nz/p/compare-broadband-auckland). They've also done something similar with telecom too.
This ultimately is the solutions. We need to break up the ISPs in Canada. Split all four of them into seperate companies. We would one set of companies which owns the last mile infrastructure of every company and multiple sets of companies which owns the consumer accounts. 
But take it further also force them to spin out their MVNO as seperate companies. For example spin off Koodo, Telus services and Public into 3 companies (4 if you include Telus infrastructure company). 
It's similar in the UK: BT was INITALLY forced to spin off it's last minlle infrastructure into a seperate company: [OpenReach](https://www.openreach.com/). Although it was initially owned by BT and kept at arm's length. The whole time it was closely monitored by the regulator on the condition they provide equitable access to all. It was eventually split off into a [seperate company](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-39228115) with BT retaining no ownership. 
This is how you foster genuine competition in the telecom space. Canada and the US are the only two countries in the developed world which use the flawed model and we both have the highest costs and the worst service because of it. Here an article from [the verge](https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/1/8321437/maps-show-why-internet-is-more-expensive-us-europe-competition) explaining why it's an issue..
Their job is to protect the ruling class. And they are doing it.
Damn straight
Their work on WE charity was interesting but I couldn’t finish their podcast series on the police. A good journalist shouldn’t let his/her personal biases creep into their reporting, using words “underlings” to describe police staff, or that the Metis embarassed the RCMP in battle when they won, but when they lose it’s somber. Or trying their hardest to paint a convicted bank robber in a flattering light. 
Just keep to the facts please.
I had to stop reading after the first paragraph.  Biased journalism is deeply frustrating to me.
Remember when it got so bad they actually had to split up the RCMP and create CSIS? Pepperidge Farms remembers. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_controversies_involving_the_Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police
Oh it goes deeper than that. Much deeper.
The RCMP constantly pushes mental health initiatives but when RCMP officers seek to use these initiatives they are often deemed a problem and management/HR will proceed to harass said officers in a passive-aggressive manner. Basically shaming them for showing mental weakness, essentially implying that these officers are abusing the medical issue support the RCMP is supposed to provide to wounded officers.
A sibling of mine was routinely put in terrible situations, while under-equipped and without backup, over the years my sibling developed PTSD and went on medical leave. The force tried to pressure said sibling into quitting, instead of retiring with medical wounded veteran pension.
They hired a psych who's task it is to deny that an officer actually has PTSD. My sibling was harassed by this psych for a couple years, he was trying to say my sibling didn't have PTSD. Despite my sibling's PTSD diagnoses being confirmed by 3 PTSD specialists, and despite going to a PTSD mental health rehab retreat.
They tried everything they could to game the system so they would he off the hook for the medical pension. They also falsified some records in an attempt to protect themselves from being sued. 
Many other former RCMP officers with similar mental health issues have reported similar hostile behaviour from the RCMP itself.
~~While I can appreciate that there are significant institutional problems with policing, Canadaland has consistently fallen short of the mark of reputable journalism in my eyes. For example, their "exposé" on the secret public servant to highlight supposed issues with the federal public service was....lackluster to say the least. The /r/Canadapublicservants rightfully laughed it off~~
Edit: I don't really know the quality of Canadaland, except for one piece which fell short to me. So I crossed out this comment as it doesn't really add much to the discussion
The RCMP is like a stacked sports team in high school. When one side makes the rules, moves the goalposts and calls all the fouls. The Civilian Oversight of the RCMP is useless or non-existent, and it shows. The Government can shut down the media and silence the people and we see that.
We lose trust in the RCMP because they show time and time again they are not trust worthy.
RCMP does not mean Raging Cops Murdering People.
But they don’t know that.
Every police force stinks. They're no longer boy scouts..... If they ever were.
On a recent episode jessie got called out for never being honest about his stake in the Ghomeshi case and it was euphoric as a long time listener. I mostly just listen to commons now but sometimes i’ll give the main one a try again and i’m usually pretty quickly amazed at their…facts(?).
On the other hand, their efforts to report on We charity, their long form podcast on Thunderbay, and the podcast about Real Estate were excellent.
Upvote for the transparency.  However, CanadaLand, despite my complete disagreement with its politics, does good work when it sinks its teeth in.
> Canadaland has consistently fallen short of the mark of reputable journalism in my eyes
How so? They seem pretty trustworthy journalistically to me. 
> For example, their "exposé" on the secret public servant to highlight supposed issues with the federal public service was....lackluster to say the least.
Yeah, that whole thing was an embarrassment, but I don't think it was journalistic malpractice or anything. As in I don't think anything they report is untrue, it was just a dumb decision to run that series in the first place.
Most of this episode is just a discussion of this article in The Walrus:
https://thewalrus.ca/can-the-rcmp-be-saved/
Canadaland is one of the only publications doing serious in depth pieces on things like what happened in NS.
> called out for never being honest about his stake in the Ghomeshi case
That's not how I would characterize that exchange. Also, take into consideration that Jesse was ultimately responsible for letting that air, so, I'm not sure it's really an indication that he lacks journo integrity. 
I find Jesse excruciating to listen to sometimes, and he does have his pet issues/axes to grind, but I don't think he lacks integrity as you were suggesting.
Glad to know I wasn't the only one cheering when she called Jesse out.
Actually you know what, I'm totally generalizing based on the public servant story. I don't know enough of the facts to make a sweeping statement like that so I'll change it
Do you have a specific one where they really sunk their teeth in? Would love to actually explore what they do
Please see my edit, I acknowledge that I was wrong to generalize
I love the transparency.
Full disclosure: I financially support Canadaland.
Well maybe law enforcement officials will actually do their jobs if that happens.
I think at this rate it's not gonna be a concern. 
No company is going to be insane enough to want to build any infrastructure projects in Native land or Canada at this point. 
CGL started in 2012 and they still can't finished it, it's a joke.
Are these protestors getting dumber or just louder
>In an interview with the Star, Miller stopped short of directly criticizing the RCMP’s decision to enforce a court injunction against the blockade last Thursday and to arrest protesters. 
I should hope not. Otherwise what are the courts for? This project is legal and has the support of most people in the area.
It'll only spread if you do nothing about blockades like the not too distant past.
Just shut off all flow of any pipeline products, it will solve itself quickly when people from bc correct the problem of these obstructions. They are too dumb to realize that it is a necessity right now to have these things, and it will help produce the products that will eventually replace it.
John Ridsdale, who’s also known as Chief Namoks, is one of the five hereditary chiefs of the Wet’suwet’en, who have been protesting the Coastal GasLink pipeline will be in court in November, and is expected to plead guilty to charges stemming from the shooting of a dog in February 2021. 
https://www.google.com/amp/s/nationalpost.com/news/canada/wetsuweten-hereditary-chief-expected-to-plead-guilty-to-killing-neighbours-dog/wcm/71dd011c-a6da-4d36-8f94-ff7e4a6eb71d/amp/#cobssid=s
Hereditary Titles are same as Dictatorships.
Let it spread, just like the Liberals did before Covid, Canada is on the ropes anyway.
*Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Marc Miller expressed regret Monday that RCMP officers arrested 15 people at a Wet’suwet’en blockade in northern British Columbia, saying he is “very concerned” that rising tensions over the long-contested Coastal GasLink pipeline could spiral into another nationwide solidarity movement.*  
*In an interview with the Star, Miller stopped short of directly criticizing the RCMP’s decision to enforce a court injunction against the blockade last Thursday and to arrest protesters. He said that he and his counterpart in the B.C. government, Murray Rankin, had pushed for a last-minute meeting with Wet’suwet’en chiefs to ensure a peaceful resolution to the situation, but that meeting did not occur.*  
*“Unfortunately, what everyone has witnessed over the last four days was sadly the result of that,” he said.*  
*Miller also said two journalists among those detained should be released, given their “fundamental” right to access such sites to cover the news and barring any evidence that they weren’t just doing their jobs.*  
*“In this country, peace comes before order, and it is something that we have to relentlessly strive (for). In this case, with respect to the enforcement of the injunction, that was not the case,” Miller said.*  
*NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Monday that he is “concerned about the use of force by the police” against the demonstrators on Thursday.*  
*“We are absolutely concerned about the use of police force and the escalation tactics that we’ve often seen with the RCMP in particular,” Singh said in Ottawa. “You’ve seen Indigenous people being arrested, and that’s never ... what we want to see. That’s not reconciliation.”*  
*The situation was reminiscent of scenes from the winter of 2020, when RCMP officers dismantled blockades and arrested demonstrators on Wet’suwet’en territory to enforce a court injunction granting access for workers building the 670-km Coastal GasLink pipeline across northern B.C.*  
*Those arrests sparked a national movement in solidarity with Wet’suwet’en hereditary chiefs, who oppose the pipeline. Demonstrators in Tyendinaga, Ont., Kahnawake, Que., New Hazelton, B.C., Halifax and elsewhere blocked rail lines and snarled the flow of freight train traffic amid declarations that “reconciliation is dead” in Canada.*  
*There have already been demonstrations again in cities across Canada since last week’s arrests. On Sunday in Toronto, protesters blocked a rail line in the west end of the city for three hours. Another demonstration occurred in Winnipeg, where people blocked major streets on Friday.*  
*Asked whether he is worried a similar situation could occur again, Miller said he is “very concerned” and is now focused on maintaining open communication with Indigenous leaders. They include elected and hereditary chiefs of the Wet’suwe’ten, as well as leaders in other nations such as the Mohawk in Tyendinaga, where demonstrators blocked CN Rail tracks outside Belleville in 2020.*  
*“Everyone knows that this breakdown of a peace process happens when communications break down,” Miller said. “My job is to make sure the information is flowing freely and that I can communicate that to the people in government.”*  
*The 2020 demonstrations waned just as the COVID-19 pandemic was declared in the late winter of that year. At the time, the federal government had signed a “memorandum of understanding” that Miller’s predecessor as Indigenous relations minister — Toronto MP Carolyn Bennett — said would formally recognize the Wet’suwet’en nation’s land rights over a vast swath of territory in northern B.C.*
*But the agreement also meant the nation would need to sort out its decision-making structure, after chiefs elected to bands created under the 19th-century “Indian Act” supported the Coastal GasLink, while hereditary chiefs from that nation’s traditional governing structure did not.*  
*On Monday, Miller said the “unfortunate reality” is that “precious little progress has been made” since that agreement was reached.*  
*“We could sit here and point fingers in the face of that. There’s plenty of blame to pass around,” he said.*  
*“But the question I face is ... how do we move forward and recognize — continue to recognize — those rights?”*
Start throwing people in jail
Under this government? Wouldn't count on it.
You must be new here
Edit: deleted a big rant. Felt good when I typed it; then thought better of it later.
ahh so that's why you posted it.
I bet the United States has probably completed 5 million barrels per day in oil pipelines since then, and god knows how much LNG pipeline. A few years back they had millions of barrels worth under construction.
Here we can't even finish one. Then we use trains to move it, which creates far more emissions. Its incredible.
And back in 2015 they called it "the gold standard of indigenous consultation, a true model for reconciliation"
Other projects are not the only concern.  The protests two years ago sparked protests and blockades "in solidarity" across the country.  Remember the railroad blockades in Ontario?  Remember the east coast being days from running out of propane to heat homes in the middle of winter?
Good.
They’re being emboldened by politicians looking for their latest sound bite and who are trying to appear as progressive as possible.
Singh and the Liberal minister know exactly what the impact of their criticism of the RCMP enforcing the injunction will be and just don’t care. Instead of saying that CGL is trying to build a project that has all its permits in place and the RCMP is upholding an injunction issued by the courts, they’re saying that arresting people breaking the law isn’t reconciliation

I noticed at Loblaws this weekend potatoes discounted to about 0.20 cents per pound. I guess it's going to go down from there.
Get ready for a high-carb winter!
The rest of canada likes potatoes ship them within our country. Or would the US have a problem with that too?
Just paid $7 for a 10lb bag of potatoes, send them to Ontario we’ll buy em
[deleted]
Currently, the only way to ship anything by land to Vancouver is through the US states.
[deleted]
Why waste them on food banks. Re-equip the army with potato canons
There is more to this country then Vancouver, those people eat food too.
Probably a global pandemic, a growing housing crisis and mass flooding in the western provinces.
Oh wait.
*thump*
"Let them eat bannock.  Or poutine."
I'm glad this mother was persistent and didn't just accept the first answer she was given.  It is easy to be intimidated by the medical profession into just taking whatever they say as truth, however doctors do make mistakes and it is everyone's right to seek out another opinion if you don't think the first doctor you saw got it right.
Trust the Science!
This is also a little dangerous because people often look for the answer they want instead of taking a professional's opinion.
And here all the government did was give them a bailout.
Well, good for Americans that *their* government will go after Air Canada. Meanwhile in Canada, ["the Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA) has been ordered to release confidential e-mails between airline lobbyists and CTA CEO, Scott Streiner, after COVID-19-cancelled flights were not refunded...Streiner was faulted by consumers’ advocates for not requiring airlines to provide passengers with cash refunds to the tune of $8.5 billion for cancelled flights at the start of the pandemic. 'There were communications between third parties and the Agency,' wrote Federal Court Justice Mary Gleason, citing evidence suggesting executives 'were involved in the discussion' to waive regulations at passengers’ expense...Section 122 of the Air Transportation Regulations which require 'refunds for services purchased but not used, whether in whole or in part, either as a result of the client’s unwillingness or inability to continue, or the air carrier’s inability to provide the service for any reason'...'You’re putting citizens in a situation where they are essentially involuntary or unwilling creditors to these huge corporations,' said NDP MP Taylor Bachrach."](https://westernstandardonline.com/2021/11/judge-says-refund-policies-were-waived-at-air-passengers-expense/)
But, hey, fuck Canadian consumers and fuck Canadian laws; our government doesn't give a shit so long as Canadians are fucked over and stolen from in French, I guess.
Another taxpayer-financed refund payout from your friends at Air Canada. Bastards.
But *you* still get nothing.
Didn't air Canada settle with the government to give refunds? Westjet didn't bother with any deal and just said screw the passengers and didn't return anything.

Knowing how promises go with this Government, this is what will happen
- pandemic measures still in place (12th shot)
- climate change goals even more unachievable
- economy down the shitter
Good luck, everyone!
They just annonced they want to bring back all the Internet censorship bills in the throne speech... liberal priorities...
Notably on the issue of housing, there were a few mentions of programs and exceptions for first time home buyers. This affirms this government's hesitancy to tackle any root issues with housing affordability and its complacency towards ever-increasing housing prices.
LOL
Oh wait, he's serious...
ROFLMAO
And I promise my next turd will be made of gold.
Best I can do is increase immigration and some internet censorship laws.
So they've promised 3 things they can't quantify or measure?
Let me rub my crystal ball and show you the future of where they don't take any accountability for their failure to accomplish even one of their 3 promises.
No other country in the world would increase their already unsustainable immigration rate during a housing crisis. It is not good for people here it is a let down for immigrants and it drives down wages. Canadians are such suckers for not seeing this. No issue with immigration but this rate is simply not sustainable.
LOL, they should have ended the pandemic earlier maybe if they think they have that much control.
Another election coming next year! There goes another $300 million.

Did he promise a chicken in every pot too?
"Simon said the Liberal government is committing to supporting and promoting the French language, both in and outside of Quebec, by reintroducing the proposed Act for the Substantive Equality of French and English"
-That's pretty rich for someone who can't speak both official languages. I get that Trudeau appointed her, but it'd be rather insulting if she didn't learn French despite holding a Federal position.
You get what you vote for!
Enjoy the decline cause with Trudy its coming fast.
Housing please open that account you promised attack inflation and stop raising taxes
Good grief this government is incompetent.
More spending
I’m hearing nothing about how they are going to end the pandemic.
Hahahaha liberal promises….  
Hahahahahahahahahahaha

Well with whats happening in mtl im not surprised whole lotta violence and nothing ever happens people as young as 15 have been killed for no apparent reason. It has to do with gang nothing else. U Got a gun and no permit bam life sentence
They know a citywide handgun ban will do nothing to address the issue, this is pure political posturing.  A cityside handgun ban only applies to legal owners. 
Heck this is Plante from September
"Fifty per cent of the city’s latest gun violence incidents are related to criminal gangs, Plante said on Saturday. She added that there have been over 100 crimes involving firearms in the city so far this year, comparing it to Toronto, the country’s longstanding gun violence capital and most populous city, which is at 300.'" 
[https://globalnews.ca/news/8222486/montreal-gun-violence-valerie-plante/](https://globalnews.ca/news/8222486/montreal-gun-violence-valerie-plante/)
What happens when gangsters start using smuggled tanks? The Liberals are administering such a porous border that legions of tanks could be driven through and no government official would be aware. Akwasasane could even facilitate.
Given that Mexico is outgunned by cartels, perhaps that’s a future for Canada.
Legault and Plante love throwing the blame around, or in Legault’s case taking photo ops for his social media for when white kids are killed only, but ignores all the other minorities that got killed
Amusingly its still pretty chill. From the 70s to the 90s you had waaaay more incidents. Car bombs, molotovs, people being gunned down in broad daylight.
Its never chill when people are dying but i can understand what youre saying
Good Timber  
by Douglas Malloch  
The tree that never had to fight  
For sun and sky and air and light,  
But stood out in the open plain  
And always got its share of rain,  
Never became a forest king  
But lived and died a scrubby thing.  
The man who never had to toil  
To gain and farm his patch of soil,  
Who never had to win his share  
Of sun and sky and light and air,  
Never became a manly man  
But lived and died as he began.  
Good timber does not grow with ease:  
The stronger wind, the stronger trees;  
The further sky, the greater length;  
The more the storm, the more the strength.  
By sun and cold, by rain and snow,  
In trees and men good timbers grow.  
Where thickest lies the forest growth,  
We find the patriarchs of both.  
And they hold counsel with the stars  
Whose broken branches show the scars  
Of many winds and much of strife.  
This is the common law of life.
BC forestry reading this headline and drooling...
Congratulations to this ancient tree for being around for centuries. 🌳 If he could talk, he would have so many deep things to share with us. 💬
Don't let Teal Jones find out
There needs to be laws on maintaining and preserving old growths forest. Could easily turn them into pristine trails for waking and tourists
"I have seen so many bears shitting in this woods"
Most of the oldest trees are in areas that are inaccessible to logging or humans. Not many people want to walk where those trees are located.
u/a0supertramp
And not to mention birds doing it directly on him! 😂🤣
Where they journalist doing their job. Or protestors who happen to also be journalists.
The bail hearing is today and more details should arrive shortly thereafter regarding the circumstances of the detainment.
If they were there in their capacity as journalists and not interfering then the RCMP needs some explaining, but if they were violating the terms of the court removal themselves then it’s understandable that they should be charged just as anyone else.
You're no longer a journalist when you're actively participating in the "protest".
John Ridsdale, who’s also known as Chief Namoks, is one of the five hereditary chiefs of the Wet’suwet’en, who have been protesting the Coastal GasLink pipeline will be in court in November, and is expected to plead guilty to charges stemming from the shooting of a dog in February 2021. 
https://www.google.com/amp/s/nationalpost.com/news/canada/wetsuweten-hereditary-chief-expected-to-plead-guilty-to-killing-neighbours-dog/wcm/71dd011c-a6da-4d36-8f94-ff7e4a6eb71d/amp/#cobssid=s
Hereditary Titles are same as Dictatorships.
Anybody can call themselves a “journalist” these days. Have a phone and a YouTube account. Boom! Journalist!
[removed]
Seems like they removed the only people that could give some clarity to the events that took place. Now we just take the RCMP’s word for it from their PR representatives?
Careful now, RCMP -- Indigenous Canada is paying attention.   
Get out of unceded territory.
Not good
>Asked to comment on the arrests, Vanessa Adams, a spokesperson for Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Marc Miller, said in an e-mail the reports were “deeply concerning.” The rights of journalists to cover events such as the protest are “essential to our democracy,” she said, and ***the journalists should not be detained “any longer than is necessary to verify that they are journalists.”***  
So you just detain them long enough to prevent them from doing their jobs...where have I heard of this before????
On Friday afternoon, award-winning photojournalist Amber Bracken was arrested by the RCMP while on assignment for The Narwhal on Wet’suwet’en territory.
Journalism is not a crime.
Amber’s arrest — along with the arrest of freelance filmmaker Michael Toledano — marks just the latest in a long string of illegal RCMP actions against journalists. Let’s be clear: journalists play an essential role in bearing witness in a democracy and have a charter right to report from within injunction zones.
Seems like the latter. They were arrested inside the obstructing buildings, which would appear to make them part of the blockade.
Seems like many protests have more people running around with cameras than signs, many of them self proclaimed journalists with their 100 followers on YouTube.
If you are in the middle of a protest and don’t clear or move when the police ask you to, expect to be arrested, and the courts to decide if you were a protester defying a lawful order or a journalist following the law.
I'm really curious to see what's happened here. It's pretty darn hard to get held in custody in BC these days. They would have already had a bail hearing on the weekend, if I understand timelines correctly, and should before a judge right about ... Now!
>Ms. Bracken, who was recognized by the CAJ for her Wet’suwet’en coverage last year and won a World Press Photo Award for her work at North Dakota’s Standing Rock in 2016, has appeared in many publications, including National Geographic, The New York Times and The Globe and Mail. She was covering the protest for the online magazine, The Narwhal. Mr. Toledano is a filmmaker who specializes in environmental and Indigenous issues, and is working on a documentary.
You don't become an award-winning photojournalist by standing in convenient places.
Bingo!
The former. The RCMP knew they were journalists.
> Narwhal editor-in-chief Emma Gilchrist also told The Globe, by e-mail, that the magazine had taken precautions to alert police to Ms. Bracken’s presence, and that she had been given press passes and a formal letter of assignment from the magazine.
..
> The Canadian Association of Journalists e-mailed the RCMP to let them know that journalists were covering the protest at the Gidimt’en camp. “We wanted to just make sure that there was no ambiguity here,” Mr. Jolly said, “that it was abundantly clear what was going on and who these people were and why they were there.”
A lot of activists are calling themselves journalists these days, and a lot of activism is being mislabeled as journalism.
The line has become really blurred.
So we now know. They were provided Police-issued Undertakings with a condition not to return to the injunction site. They refused to acknowledge the condition, which forces an initial bail hearing which was held Saturday. 
A charge was recommended and approved but I missed what it was. Presumably obstruction, but I am NOT certain. 
They were released on a Judicially imposed Undertaking not to return to the injunction site. 
My suspicions that something was up came true. There were no press credentials, and they are alleged to have actively participated in the barricaded.
The journalist an on assignment form The Narwal.
Well, let me see.  You are offering $18/hr in Newmarket.
([https://ca.indeed.com/company/ROLLerUP-Solutions-Inc./jobs/Installer-Technician-d4a7b5a5da22574c?fccid=25138d2deb775c2c&vjs=3](https://ca.indeed.com/company/ROLLerUP-Solutions-Inc./jobs/Installer-Technician-d4a7b5a5da22574c?fccid=25138d2deb775c2c&vjs=3))
That's $36k/yr, roughly, before taxes.  $720.00 per week.  Take home of roughly $600.00 week, before any benefits, CPP, EI. Let's call it $600 though for arguments sake.
That's approx $2600/ month in total take home income.  Average rent for a 1 bedroom apartment in Newmarket is $1855/mo, ([https://www.zumper.com/rent-research/newmarket-on](https://www.zumper.com/rent-research/newmarket-on))  leaving $745.
$745/month for food, transportation, cell phone, internet, entertainment, clothes, etc.
Oh, what's that?  You need to pay for Child Care?  Retirement?  Savings? Vacation?
Honestly, it's un-livable.  
\*\*\*EDIT\*\*\*: CERB is over folks....can't blame it on that.  So is the CRB.  There is a proposed lockdown benefit, but that hasn't been approved and would only be $300/wk.
Hmm let me guess, the business is paying as low a wage as they can and probably offer zero benefits. All this labour shortage stuff is just bullshit. There's no shortage of labour, there is a shortage of good paying jobs. People are sick and tired of working hard day in and day out to see the companies make more and they make less and less. Now with inflation out of control, wages that were ok 5 years ago are garbage now. I bet if this business offered a liveable wage and or benefits, they'd have no problem getting people applying.
Guess it is time to pay more.
your job offer sucks balls 
how about make it not suck instead of crying that nobody wants to do the  shitty job youre offering
we dont have a labor shortage - we have good job shortage and the rest of us are sick of working shitty ones for no money
When you print money you show people currency is nothing. Why would anyone work like shit for something that can be printed out of thin air.
Who says min-income won't work with these kinds of results out of CERB?!! /s
Love how our corporate media keep reporting on stories like this.  One story out of BC, reported on ad nauseum, was about a small restaurant offering #50k/annum for a dishwasher.
I call BULLSHIT on most of these stories.  It's a narrative largely established by corporations and the political right.
Bugger off Torstar and Postmedia and all the others pushing this narrative while feasting on corporate welfare. (Hundreds of millions of $$ going to an American hedgefund because of a manufactured "crisis" ??)  They have ZERO credibility.
With CERB no need to work...
Nice.
Almost without exception this is the situation. And its really unfortunate that although a Redditor such as yourself has the critical thinking skills to see through the bullshit, the "journalist" who wrote this garbage presented it as something entirely different.
We need more people like you who are willing to question these labor shortage narratives being spun by industry and their media puppets.
Excellent digging.
The missing piece of information is how much they can increase wages, and still be viable - all options on the table: 
- the owners reduce their own pay to zero and share it with the staff; 
- they increase their prices in the face of competition and accept losing some business potentially; 
- they sell the business to bigger/sharper/cheaper running players in their space.
The potential of the business failing has to be considered, along with the effect of wages going to $0/hr, as a result.
The wage shortage problem.
Don't worry though, the government has promised that its reviewing its options in regards to easing the wage pressure on employers.
>Hmm let me guess, the business is paying as low a wage as they can and probably offer zero benefits.
You guessed wrong.
Some jobs suck, I'll give you that. You know what sucks more? 
 Homelessness.
You've hit the essential argument right on the head about not flooding the economy with free currency the way we have.  
The economy is a confidence game.  Live a long time in low to no inflation and you believe that you can stack money away - put it into something that will itself grow too - and later get back the value you invested via your blood, sweat and tears.
Believe instead that it is all bullshit, and by the time you need that equivalent value back out, it will be *gone* and you won't accept it any longer.
For the short term, you will because you have to - but you will demand a hefty premium for the loss in value it will suffer between getting it, and spending it.
Inflation.
In the long term you will get *out* of the currency.  Big assets instead - like houses.  Like gold.
That has been the *cri de coeur* on here from the right, since it all began.  And it was roundly shouted down by those that think only for today - and more free money vs. working for it.
Now we have oceans of free money chasing too few goods: classic [Adam Smith's 1776 Wealth of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations).  
We've known for centuries not to do what we've done to ourselves.
Funiest part will be when they get back fromCERB and will be a lot less motivated to work for less.
The turnaround ratio wilk get crazy.
Min-income baby.  It works!
I mean, most families include two incomes, so...
Nice honest opinion. Most here think all business owners are fat cat CEOs sitting on sacks of gold. Little do they realize that more than 70% of businesses are small, the owners most likely have their life savings and home mortgaged to the hilt for the business and most likely taking home less a month than their employees. But hey, if they can't pay a living wage they deserve to fold and provide no employment.
I said it a few days ago, maybe there's just too many businesses in some sectors and the herd needs to be thinned out.

Someone has to explain religious exemption to me? What about vaccines spurs an exception due to your religion?
From what I remember, the good ol' Good Book was pretty clear about plagues and poxes.
COVID will recognize their exemption and just leave them alone. Good plan Pastor!!
> religious COVID-19 vaccine exemptions
I'm fine with prayer being their *solution* if those who believe 100% isolate from the rest of us.
They asked about his religious rationale for vaccine exemptions and he offered a political one. Does he actually believe or is he just there for a pay cheque?
I don't agree with the Pastor, but he did nothing wrong.
If religious exemptions are a thing, maybe fixing the law shall be the priority.
I am beginning to feel we are passing through the crossroads of individual freedoms.
Following the arc of civil liberties through the 20th and 21st centuries, it was an ever liberalizing application of greater individual freedoms.  
And it was tough, and unevenly applied, but it always worked for the better in the longer run.
Now, it seems like we're beginning to suffer from some pretty significant side effects.
Freedom to own a gun seems to be correlated with freedom to die by one when you look south of the border (we do much much better so there is still room to mitigate this one).
Freedom of speech is sorely tested, almost perpetually, by idiots who hide within it to promote an agenda.  Our best definition of hate speech seems to be the pornography one: I know it when I see it.
Freedom of religion is feeling its oats now too.  I wonder how many have been sicken, and/or died, that can be traced back to a frivolous "I'm not doing this because I am an immature child.  I am getting a religious exemption."
People still go to church. 🤮
In the beginning, God created man. And he looked at his creation and said, "this damn fool will believe anything said in my name. Ah well, it's Sunday. Time for resting."
FFWD and a bunch of idiots think Luciferase is in the vaccines (it isn't) and that it is the devil's gene (it isn't) and that getting injected with it will keep them out of heaven. (it won't.)
And here we are...
Some vaccines are (supposedly/possibly) developed using stem cells that originate from an aborted fetus from the '80s or something, that's about the only one I've heard of and it might not even be true.
The TLDR is that some religions view vaccines as 'unnatural' via a variety of justifications.
The funny thing is that, because of our human rights code, people wouldn't even need a religious exemption. 
LINK: [http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/code\_grounds/creed#:\~:text=Under%20the%20Ontario%20Human%20Rights,respect%2C%20regardless%20of%20their%20creed.&text=Policy%20on%20preventing%20discrimination%20based%20on%20creed%20(2015)](http://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/code_grounds/creed#:~:text=Under%20the%20Ontario%20Human%20Rights,respect%2C%20regardless%20of%20their%20creed.&text=Policy%20on%20preventing%20discrimination%20based%20on%20creed%20(2015))
The HRC protects any and all strong beliefs. This hasn't REALLY been tested in court yet, but any belief relating a person's self-professed identity is protected.
This basically covers everything.
I thought it was because native religions did not like some forms of modern medicine.
It also had something to say about respecting the authority of the land.
Sure, but if religious exemptions are an option, the Pastor did nothing wrong.
Maybe consider changing the law instead just blaming people following the law.
If religious exceptions are a problem, just ban them.
No need to blame the pastor for something that is perfectly legal and allowed.
They were fine with all the childhood vaccines they got.  They don't even object to the shingles or pneumonia shot.  
A religious leader not advocating for a jab is no leader at all.  Doesn't matter what his faith is.  Pretty sure this guy didn't pray for guidance on doing providing falsehood exemptions.
Sure, but I guess they will not have to pay taxes either. You know, constitutional rights.
If you’re vaccinated what is your worry? Other vaccinated people can still transmit the virus.
All those "problems" are invented.  They really aren't anywhere close to the real problems our society faces, and to the extent they exist are a small price to pay for the freedoms we enjoy.
The good vastly outweighs the few negatives.

Convenient for his feigned confusion here, Rex fails to mention that one of the most recent achievements Heiden can boast about is helping Jian Ghomeshi weasel out of his rape charges.
Old man yells at cloud.
She’s a criminal defense lawyer. She did her job, as it is defined in our democratic society. Every criminally accused person has a right to a lawyer and implying she is immoral as a result is short-sighted.
Weasel out of a rape charge is a weird way of saying being found not guilty in court.
Nadia Murad at the age of 14 was kidnapped by ISIS, the vicious terrorist mob, and was taken into sex slavery
Okay, Big Shoots. Tell me in one paragraph, or less, how de-platforming women who have been subjected to sexual slavery is a win for 13-18 yo girls in Toronto.
This guy must be unironically fun at the parties.
bUt hE cRoSsEd sTAtE LinEs
None of that makes Rex’s braindead whinge against “wokeness” any less pathetic.
That’s not what the article is about though. It’s just another facetious “woke bad” rant, just like half of Rex’s columns (the other half being “oil good”).
For example, during this same enlightened moment, there was another female writer thought by the same board superintendent to be unsuitable. This author was herself a young woman, who experienced and survived an ordeal comparable to anything of horror a human mind can contemplate. It was Nadia Murad, the winner of the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize and her book, The Last Girl: My Story of Captivity, and My Fight Against the Islamic State.
Here’s a paragraph from her Nobel Prize lecture :
“As a young girl, I dreamed of finishing high school. It was my dream to have a beauty parlour in our village and to live near my family in Sinjar. But this dream became a nightmare. Unexpected things happened. Genocide took place. As a consequence, I lost my mother, six of my brothers and my brothers’ children. Every Yazidi family has a similar story, one more horrible than the other because of this genocide.”
A broken clock is still correct twice per day ..
That is indeed a quote from Rex’s article. I’m surprised he didn’t find a way to squeeze in something about how oil is great.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_fallacy
Except this article isn’t bad simply because it’s from Rex, although that’s usually a good tip off that an article will be shit. It’s a bad article all on its own merit (or lack thereof).
How so?
It’s just standard conservative culture war outrage bait, slathered in Rex’s signature atrocious writing style.
So you can't actually point to anything specific you object to?

Not sure what else to see other than BMO Field, it's the biggest grass field in the country, the rest are turf and not up to FIFA standards. They already asked Edmonton to change Commonwealth's turf field into grass if they want to host games.
corrupt people in Toronto check to see if they can do corrupt things for 2026
No.  No no no no N.O. No.
FIFA is rotten to the core.  The Wynne government corruption, that ripped-off millions upon millions for her party's supporters in the name of the Pan-Am Games, should not be allowed to reoccur.
No thanks go away please
Yea, no thanks.
Please no. There's no benefits to hosting these types of events. 
Our priority should be to focus our developments on housing, not stadiums.
Please, please, please, please, PLEASE do not bring the World Cup here to Toronto.
sort out the country's housing and other cost of living (e.g. food) problems before bringing us World Cup.
Bread not circuses!!!
Toronto shouls co host with Montréal.
Jesus christ no. Our city's infrastructure is aging and overwhelmed as it is. We do not need to bring in millions of people and make life hell for our people for several weeks just to pad the pockets of a global cabal of plutocrats. Fuck FIFA.
Get out our best blow and call some hookers.
Toronto could never be the sole host city of this event.
They can put real grass over top the artificial stuff if need be, it's an expense but probably cheaper than digging up and replacing the artificial surface for a few games.  
They did that for the 1994 World Cup in the US, created a system of trays of real grass so they could play games indoors at the Pontiac Silverdome.
But it was good enough for the women soccer players in 2015...
Even BMO wouldn’t cut it. While it looks pretty on TV, BMO isn’t equipped to host a world cup. Especially BMO training grounds. Theres just not enough staff and equipment to maintain constant use. The facilities on the inside are incredibly subpar for the players. There would need to be some heavy renovations that I don’t believe could be finished by 2026.
[deleted]
No idea how you correlate housing with the World Cup. Wild. How about just no sports, restaurants, or any forms of entertainment until there is affordable housing?
Should we also abolish all Canadian professional sports teams until we've solved the housing and cost of living problems?
You sound like fun at parties.
Being this much of a miserable bastard all the time has got to be exhausting.
Cool i guess economy > ecosystem
Riiight. Our prime minister is actively conspiring with a foreign leader to TANK THE CANADIAN ECONOMY!
More quality, unbiased news from the erp Post.
Sorry. I barfed in my mouth a little when I typed that.
Rex hates everybody, all the time. Why isn't he doing his part to prop up O'Toole? Tell us why he is the best choice for PM, and point to all of his perfect actions and stances?
It is not a criminal conspiracy, it is a conspiracy of ideological stupidity.
O'Toole doesn't have to be perfect.  The current PM is the worst PM in 154 years.  My son's golden retriever would be an improvement.  O'Toole would be a vast improvement.
So what policies exactly do you disagree with and what are your solutions? What is your solution for climate change that your side of the fence has been denying for a generation?
I start to check out of the political talk when the opposition parties (all brands are the same) decide to use negative branding. "We hate everything the other person is doing!" 
Brad Wall was great for this during the run up to the election cycle, every answer started with "11 years ago, when the NDP were in power..."
Scheer did it for years, everything he said or wrote started with "Justin Trudeau's Liberals.. "
I would rather a party/leader to be willing to tell me what their plan is. I want to hear how they feel about issues and why they are important.
But we see that you don't motivate people to vote by telling them what a nice guy you are. You motivate them the most by tapping into fear or anger. The way of society these days I guess.
lol. I’m sure your position is objective and well reasoned. Trudeau is garbage but Harper was hot garbage. Harper bent us iver backwards on soft wood even after we won the case. He talked Ontario manufacturing chasing alberta oil as s primary economic driver causing a high petro dollar. Harper also took in way more debt after inheriting a healthy economy for idiotic partisan tax cut rains. Their surplus was bit structural. Yes, Trudeau debt legacy is shocking. But harrier is hand down the worst leader in a generation.

A thunderstorm happens independently of whether you predict it or not.  
Since *people* blow up pipelines, saying "pipelines are going to get blown up" is a little different.
Imagine Kenney said:
"If Suzuki and his movement keep attacking Alberta's oil sector, you're going to start seeing assassinations of politicians and environmentalists."
He's just making a prediction you guys! /s
Not the same as Suzukis deluded ramblings.
> A thunderstorm happens independently of whether you predict it or not.
Everything happens independent of predictions, that's the point of a prediction.
If CSIS or RCMP predict that we're going to get hit by ISIS attacks does that mean that CSIS or the RCMP are inciting them?
This is an area where some judgement is needed. Is it harmless any time a politician or someone in the public eye says there will be violence? Definitely not. I don't really know how Suzuki meant this and it could be taken to mean he expects or maybe even wants violence but its also odd to see people who are normally sober about free speech issues jumping on this one.
You forgot to blame Trudeau!
Says a lot about the party itself no? 
Our leader sucks, but everyone within sucks as much or more. Vote for us!
'member when Leslyn Lewis seemed like a credible candidate for the leadership?
...or when Maxime Bernier nearly *was* the new Conservative leader?
I know thoughtful, charismatic, reasonable Conservatives, but none of them have the slightest desire to be ringmaster of this particular circus.
Pierre Polievere is waving frantically at the back of the crowd
Can all of these ignorant anti-vaxx troglodytes please bugger off and permanently cease existing?
Our country and standard of living are rapidly going to complete shit and we desperately **need an opposition party focused on real issues of importance**.
It was like 2 months ago when the media was telling everyone that O'Toole was the PM Canada needed and now he can't even keep the crazies under wraps. Inspiring stuff.
When the only possible alternative leader speculated upon is Skippy, the astonishing failure of the party - an opposition party in the G7 - becomes clear.
This is a "party" in name only. The traumatized offspring from a shotgun wedding, it functioned purely as the enabler for he that held the shotgun - Harper. When he left, his party returned to its constituent parts, and there it will stay until it either finds another megalomaniac and ruthless leader who will again force it together, or a visionary who will officially split it apart. 
Obviously, neither O'Toole or Skippy can play either part.
At this rate, Trudeau will win another majority in 2024 without even trying.
They have become a party of mediocrity, and I feel I am being kind here. Their top people could be deemed extra medium at best. The ones out in BC are standing waist deep in water denying climate change. They are extolling things that are vilified by decent people. They have engaged the alt-right, nazis, fascists, white supremacists, misogynists, and racists and have claimed this bunch as their "base".
Don't worry, some individual will come along and yell that only they can solve all your problems. And then we'll all follow them cause their super fans will beat the shit out of us if we don't.
it should be because he actually seems competent but the cons apparently don’t want to win any elections
# NotTheBeaverton
I keep telling my Conservative friends this - if you're upset about how things are being run, look no further than the Conservative Party of Canada who managed to lose to blackface Trudeau, and unnecessary power grab during a pandemic Trudeau. Its laughable how bad the CPC is right now, and the Liberals dont have to work that hard because of it.
In what universe cant a whole party not come up with a person who could even put forth issues that people care about.
Like If there was a candidate who ran on “lowering house prices” just that only that Id vote. It would at least show me they were aware of reality.
Anyone here watch the latest episode of succession ? 
Boyer, anyone ?
You mean Harper is going to keep hiding behind the curtain and we're supposed to pretend no one sees the "great and powerful" IDU?
The Conservative Party is about as nutty as it's ever been. But it makes sense considering the political landscape we currently live in.
This feels so much like the ["Honest Bob" Stanfield era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Stanfield#1967_Progressive_Conservative_leadership_convention).  Likeable guy who was clean as a whistle, but DOA in the charisma department.
If only charisma wasn't so important to the peace, order, and good governance of Canada.  Thank all the gods that a great man came along sporting a jaunty image, to run against Bob and lead us not into temptation .... well errrr.... he found every one and fully indulged in it actually.
All the Conservatives need to do to win infinitely is run a trans POC and scream diversity. Doesn't matter what their platform is, the whole left side would have to concede.

This was something the political talking heads were saying: it's hard to push the message that your party is the electable party when there's so much internal squabbling.
Rapid tests need to be a public health tool. Free to families, just imagine going to Christmas dinner knowing that everyone there has a negative test.

Expect our government to make a lot of statements and gross proclamations but to do absolutely nothing of substance.
Cost of housing was one of the key issues during the election and our establishment political parties could barely be bothered to mention it.

And our CAD currency is crashing very HARD now comparing to Chinese Yuan. Our money is worth less and less...Our Government must stand up to protect and maintain the value of our money, the Canadian Dollar.
Since China entered the WTO on December 11, 2001 and up to the end of 2007, 1 CAD was never under 6 Chinese Yuan, it was ranged from 6.07 to 7.88 with average of 7 and now 1 CAD worth 5.05 Chinese Yuan. The value of CAD had gone down nearly a shocking 30% comparing with Chinese Yuan!

Also we strongly blame Uighur exploitations in China and boycott its products however do you know how much of these HUGE dirty bloody monies gained from the exploitations had bought properties in Canada through free money laundering?
Just in this month, Ontario NDP's two MPPs introduced "anti-money laundering bill to make homes affordable". Why at federal level, we do not have such bill to be proposed to fight the money laundering in housings across Canada as all major Canadian Banking systems are regulated by the Fedreal Government?
https://www.bhutilakarpoche.ca/ndp_mpps_introduce_anti_money_laundering_bill_to_make_homes_affordable
And not a single person in Parliament will care, they're rich
Parliament's return? The fucking election was two months ago. Does no one see a problem with this? Out politicians are a fucking joke.
[deleted]
It's housing. Homes are unreasonably expensive, rent has exploded, no disposable income for anything else. It won't matter which government is in charge, drastic steps will be taken sooner or later.
Ban foreign home ownership.
Now.
It's easy to implement and immediately addresses part of the problem.
Jokes on you the next election is 4 years away sucker...
Liberals will do nothing if they were serious they would not have taken a 4 month holiday they will be back this week but seem very concerned about the internet bill and immigration.
Nothing will be done about inflation, or housing.
We need to end single-family home exclusionary zoning. We need to enact punitive taxes on second, third, fourth, etc homes, rising exponentially. We need to enact punitive taxes on flippers and speculators. We need to ban foreign ownership without reciprocal agreement. We need to end corporate ownership of residential property. We need to ban blind bidding. We need transparency in corporate ownership. We need to finance investigation into financial crime, money laundering, and give FINTRAC teeth. We need to overrule municipalities and allow densification without NIMBY obstruction. We need more flexibility in zoning codes.
We desperately need to build UP and not wide. We need to put an end to our car-centric, suburban development, invest in mass transit, bike lanes, car-free streets, and walkable urban areas. We have a LOT to do to make up for the mistakes of the past. The Boomers need to retire, they're no longer fit to build our cities, their vision of the future is not working, and nothing will get better unless we take huge and drastic steps to improve our chances of a high quality of life in the future, for all Canadians, not just those that bought houses in a few major metros in the 70s and 80s. The damage has been done and it will take decades to make things better, but we need to make changes NOW.
There are bigger fish to fry.  Clearly Canadians are more concerned with important issues affecting everyone, like attempting for the 4th time to ban conversion therapy.  /s
I wonder when that 5 year ban on foreign buyers is coming. If all the housing promises, that can be done with the stroke if a pen.  The timing of that getting done will be a good indicator of how much the Liberals intend to actually follow through on housing promises.
Parliament: best I can do is censor your thoughts
The libertards are working hard at addressing the cost of living issue. Sean Fraser, the immigration minister announced they will be ramping up immigration even more from 400,000.
These 400,000 every year is the equivalent of a Mississauga every year. They will be competing for housing with families here, young people looking to move out, young couples seeking their first home , all increasing the demand while the supply of housing will be nowhere near be the same.
Oh and he admitted that this immigrant influx will keep the wages in control. Increased cost of living and even lower wages.
They got it all figured out. Keep these guys in power. Dont worry.
My Mom is now collecting Old Age Security and while I was grocery shopping with her yesterday she was remarking about how everything is more expensive.
Cost of living and especially the cost of housing is my #1 issue.
Liberals benefit from status quo why would they change it
The problem is that when the Government will act on the rising costs, it will go for the lowest hanging fruit type of fix instead of addressing the systemic problems which are producing these results.
Justin doesn't care. He's too busy censoring the internet.
the people think cost of living is a top priority? fuck that, lets censor the internet instead!
Parliament returns just in time for Christmas break.
This has already been strongly recommended by many studies, including one by a supreme court justice. Studying it again means the Liberals decided they aren't going to do it.
It's not a bad idea. Tribunals aren't great for ferreting out corruption, and in many cases moving the legal system away from court + juries harms faith in the institution of law.
Having private internal courts for public sectors, judicial, military, legislative etc. were originally born out of a desire to arbitrate cases quickly (Even today, most cases in Canada end in arbitration.), but it might be better for clear governance to have a singular court system with transparent oversight.
This move alone won't get us there, and there are a lot of quirks of Canadian law we'd have to overturn (Notwithstanding clause, privacy act(advantages granted to public heads and offices), crown rights to prevent disclosure of documents, etc.), but we could eventually get there.
Can't see this being a smooth transition given the differences between military justice and the Civilian courts.
I think we're getting a bit ahead of ourselves launching a study so quickly, I propose a study to determine the feasability of a study of the plan.
I'd be willing to conduct the study for a standard consultancy fee plus expenses, service fees, administration fees, oh and I'll need the government to pay the lawyers fees upfront to have a contract drawn up before it can be submitted for review.
They should just eliminate the military justice system for any crimes that are not specifically military.
How would that work? Civilian justice system and military justice systems aren’t the same I don’t think.
Maybe we should launch a study, to study the study, and ensure the team on the first study is gender balanced
/s
We should do something similar with the police
"You see!  We DID something!  Now stop blaming us for this debacle we smirked and joked about for the entire time we've been here."
Not a terrible idea, but with Trudeau’s government being pro-sexual assault(multiple cover-ups and tabling bills that lower sentences for sexual assaulters and allow then to just do their time on house arrest… enough proof?) I really don’t see how we’ll get the right outcomes.
I thought the Woke PM believes victims, so they need a study? Or they realize doing this would make the government admitt guilt on all the cover up's.
100% this was a suggestion in the 2015 Deschamps report.
The study is to determine the impact on public perception, Liberal approval ratings and to determine the benefit of the change to the party
It means the government would not be able to cover it up and they would be force to pay out $$$$$.
I’m sure soldiers will love a $500k defence lawyer bill.
I see a lot of cases being thrown out of court if they do this
https://youtu.be/9FnO3igOkOk
>I’m sure soldiers will love a $500k defence lawyer bill.
I'm sure they wouldn't!
But in some ways that's actually a good thing. It increases pressure on public institutions not to break or push the law. They're responsible on a personal level for their actions.
I'd expect pushback from public employee unions, since it's the most unionized industry in Canada (77%+ membership), and currently the government foots the bill for public employee misconduct in the form of union agreements and public suits.

"That's about 2.6 per cent of the entire supply"
"Some waste is to be expected"
“Some of that wastage might be from breaches of cold chain (some vaccines must be kept at low temperatures), but some could be not getting them into arms before the vaccine expires. It's a complex, complex, complex issue,” Upshur said.
So, not "thrown away" as the overly hysterical, sensationalized headline suggests.
What does it matter now you were giving out expired doses before ....
Oof:
>  Unused doses vary wildly across Canada. Alberta reported disposing of 10 per cent of its doses; Nova Scotia 0.3 per cent.
Doesn't sound like an unreasonable number.
>Alberta continues to have hundreds of thousands of doses stockpiled
if the doses were distributed proportionally, then the comparisons made in the article actually matter
I said this in the r/Ontario post, but originally Fortin said they projected a 5% waste/spoilage, when vaccines were first being introduced, so really the numbers aren’t bad at all.
Trudeau is a fraud. Like Trump is a fraud. Like so many of these "leaders" are frauds.
There are people who actually walk the walk. Trudeau ain't one of 'em. He's a trust fund dilettante who will have many years on corporate boards ahead of him for his commitment to selling Canadians hot air and empty gestures.
Anyone thinking Trudeau is going to help save the earth is a fool.
Paraphrasing George Carlin: I’m Pretty sure the earth is gonna be fine, it’s the people who are fucked
Yet he does everything to stop actually fixing the issue
Can we talk about the out of control spending and how virtue-signalling Quebec politicians are the only ones concerned with a handgun ban?
Trudeau can continue to lie to you, but that buyback of his is going to cost billions of dollars and isn't even close to being implemented. Not only that, but because of the CCFR court challenge the amnesty is almost guaranteed to run out before such a program could even be in place.
What a joke. They've ran poll after poll about what concerns Canadian voters and guns haven't made the top 20, but we gotta keep pandering to these special interest groups who want to completely destroy firearm ownership in Canada.
Hilarious coming from his government.
Humans seem to be walking anxiety zombies. We move from one apocalypse to the next and one crisis to the next. Every generation seems to think it's the very last one on earth, and the measures they take to ward off the impending doom always appear quite silly later.
How about we work on cleaning the planet up in a spirit of calm and diligence rather than hysteria and panic? For Christ's sake.
"The earth is in danger and we're going tax the fuck out of you. Maybe that will work by 2030!"
The earth is in danger, so let me fly to COP26 with thousands of corporate lackeys (+30,000 delegates...not including the support on the ground, can you imagine?!) so that we can talk about it. Watch how I sit pretty and zoom in to my socks please so I can VS some more. 
Im sorry guys, I cant believe Ill say it, in this, Thunberg was correct. Blah,blah,blah.
No kidding. I'm sure his top scientists heard it on facebook.
It certainly is in danger if people keep electing governments like his.
Perfectly jibes with the decision to purchase the Trans Mountain pipeline.
This is like signing up for a regular supply of cigars after being diagnosed with lung cancer.
He just spent a life's worth of carbon emissions flying around the country in a private jet for an election no one wanted that yielded the exact same result we had before...but yeah let's talk about the Earth being in danger...
> In a historic first, she delivered the address alternating between Inuktitut, French and English. Rideau Hall said Tuesday’s speech marked the first time that more than a greeting is delivered in an Indigenous language during a Throne Speech.
That’s pretty cool.
Without spending trillions when inflation is already out of control what more can we do right now? It’s an unfortunate truth. I can’t afford more taxes and inflation is eating my retirement fund.
The Earth is in danger of fraud politicians like JT CF and most supporters, and stupid breeders.  If the last 4 years didn't show you, give your head a good shake.
And I will wager $100 Trudeau flies off for another vacation on Aga Khan's private island before his term as PM is over.
Everyone should be buying a vat of KY jelly about now.
Trump understood Trudeau. Trudeau is a fraud.
Lol who do you suggest as a leader..curious
Trudeau is not a fraud. He makes progress within the system.

Its buried. Trudeau was ordered to release the documents surrounding the firing of these 2 scientists by parliament committee and he said he couldn't do that because of "national security"
Ya......right.
And Justin is just thrilled I'll bet..lol
Did they ever resolve that whole lawsuit thing, or was it just cancelled by the election?
"No. Please. Don't give me another $85,000 on top of my six figure salary!"
So $600 million to have exactly what we had… 5 months ago? 5 months of no federal government while BC washes away, inflation through the roof, etc etc…
Yikes! Not a lot of social distancing in that photo. No wonder we’re still in this thing.
The tradeoff to having one of your MP’s become the Speaker is just that. You have one fewer MP to support your motions.
The suit was dropped because of the election.
Not sure if this new House can pursue the same question of privilege, but I think they can if they wish.
Ya, and he called Trudeau out for keeping the firing of the 2 Chinese scientists in Winnipeg secret. Trudeau even took him to court to get him to shut up.
I'm actually surprised by this.  suspected he'd be offered to be on the cabinet, or told not to run.   
I even made a post that was upvoted alot here.  Are these votes public ?
No, secret ballot.
I did not expect the version of reality where David Suzuki becomes a terrorist lol!
&#x200B;
OTTAWA — Green sage David Suzuki has some expensive tastes for someone who wants to shut down the carbon economy within a generation.  
QMI Agency has learned that Suzuki, who's made a name for himself fighting for the environment and against development, owns four homes, including one property he co-owns with a fossil fuels company.  
His primary abode is a sprawling mansion in the Kitsilano neighbourhood of Vancouver, worth approximately $8.2 million.  
At Occupy Vancouver, Suzuki extolled the virtues of his anti-corporate agenda and condemned excess.  
He owns another slightly more modest property in the Kitsilano neighbourhood. Its value is listed as $1.01 million.  
Suzuki owns a waterfront property on the Quadra Island area off the B.C. coast, that appears from photos to be something of a cottage getaway, complete with boat dock. The property is valued at $1.1 million.  
Perhaps most interesting is a property on Nelson Island of which Suzuki is one of several co-owners listed on a B.C. land title registry, another of which includes Kootenay Oil Distributors.  
Nelson Island is predominantly forested with little economic activity and a tiny permanent population.
[deleted]
Where will he get the fuel for his Learjet?
David Suzuki is the ultimate hypocrite. Now he's trying to incite terrorism.
Is this the same David Suzuki that was half of my middle school science ciriculum in the early 90s?
"We’ve got to start living in a way that reflects the place that we live.”
Like frequently using a private helicopter to get to and from one's mansion on Quadra island, rather than taking a ferry like the plebs.
Hey, does everyone remember when David Suzuki claimed that Fukushima was in danger of [wiping out all of Japan](https://www.vice.com/en/article/gq8gbm/these-nuclear-physicists-think-david-suzuki-is-exaggerating-about-fukushima) and that everyone on the west cost of North America was going to have to evacuate?
Blowing up a pipeline would just lead to oil spills and using force to defend them. Pipelines can't go away without thousands of Canadians dying anytime soon
Yes let’s just go ahead and condone ecoterrorism.
So...terrorism?
Suzuki also believes he is above needing to purchase fishing licenses in this province
Stochastic Terrorism?
He owns 8 residential properties btw.
That sounds like a terroristic threat.
Fuck this guy. Ask him how many homes he owns
What a douche
The David Suzuki who Co owns multiple empty homes around the world with major oil companies. Makes sense....
This guy is full of shit. I'm all for being environmentally conscious but this guy is a fucking hypocrite. 
Unrelated, but when I was in high school, we attended a presentation by him. I remember we had to pay. The presentation lasted the whole afternoon, but he only spoke for 15 minutes. He was the headliner for the event but we spent the rest of the afternoon seeing some other stuff but mostly... waiting,  and honestly it felt like money wasted (note: it was a mandatory outing)
He predicted with absolute certainty that the world would end 5 years after the Fukushima reactor melted down.  Then he started whacking off in one of his mansions.
David Suzuki is a nut job. Always has been. Somehow he became famous, despite clearly being loony fucking tunes.

So they held on to 4.5 million, earned interest in it for almost 2 years, and received federal bailouts. 
Never mind having a reputation as the worst customer service in the Canadian airline industry. 
They’re borderline criminal.
Air Canada has agreed to pay $4.5 million US to the U.S. Department of Transportation for extreme delays in providing refunds to thousands of consumers who had their flights to or from the U.S. either cancelled or significantly changed during the pandemic.”
…”the airline took anywhere between five and 13 months to issue refunds for cancelled flights.”
Some real world perspective:
The US gave the US airlines billions in aid during the first year of COVID to help them avoid bankruptcy and pay back their customers.  Pretty much every country in the World did the same.  Canada did not.
In Sept of 2020 the US government gave US carriers $25 Billion in Grants if I recall correctly plus another $25 billion in loans and $10 billion for Cargo carriers.  That aid was to so there carriers didn't go bankrupt and could pay customers back.      
US Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said in a statement that the agreement would “help preserve the strategic importance of the airline industry while allowing for appropriate compensation to the taxpayers.”
Meanwhile - back here in Canada - crickets.   No airline aid.  Maybe the only country in the world that wasn't ready to help their airlines avoid bankruptcy which is what the airlines would have done if forced to pay back back customers.
Then in 2021 a second bailout package for the US airlines- this time it was $15 Billion.  
Meanwhile back here in Canada....Still more crickets from Ottawa.  Air Canada still couldn't refund their customers without risking bankruptcy.  
When help finally did come from the Canadian Government it was almost useless - West jet flat out turned it down.  Air Canada used the loan portion ($1.9 Billion) to pay back customers - even the ones that had bought NON refundable tickets.  The government got a share in the airline and it's pretty clear the loan will be paid back.
And if they had gone bankrupt due to COVID and the actions of the Government in closing the border - passengers would have got nothing.
> The US gave the US airlines billions in aid during the first year of COVID to help them avoid bankruptcy and pay back their customers.  Canada did not.
Not true.  
Air Canada went to the government and asked for money and they said they would only give them money if they would give refunds for cancellled flights.   Which at first Air Canada didn't agree to.  No since business is booming they are pulljng out of the aid package.

> Air Canada went to the government and asked for money and they said they would only give them money if they would give refunds for cancellled flights. 
They couldn't do as you say becasue it would have risked putting them in Receivership or Chapter 11 (Bankruptcy protection)  That's why most of the other countries in the world bailed out the airlines before the airlines paid out customers.  And lets be clear - all of the refundable tickets were paid out or the coupons/vouchers were accepted.  The ones that were not initially paid out and what all the stink is about is the NON refundable tickets.  
Some would argue - me included - the governments closed the borders downs and effectively shut AC, WestJet, Transat and Porter down.  They were ultimately responsible for the cancelled flights and should have helped with the ticket refunds that our carriers would have to absorb.  I think that's what all the countries recognized and why them were so quick with the bailout packages.

more training? how bout more firing
This is not an issue of training.
Maybe we could try not scraping the bottom of the educational, intellectual and moral barrel to hire the people we expect to protect us.
"more training" my law-abiding ass
The guy in the article listing all the things the cops should have done should have to spend a month riding with police on mental health calls.  Police on a call with a guy who is twice the size of any of them, not in a stable frame of mind, and wanting to get into his car don't have the luxury of a tidy clinical office to have a nuanced conversation.  If the guy gets in his car and tries to drive away, there's a really good chance someone is going to get seriously hurt.
Police don't have the luxury of having a nice sit down with a cup of cocoa and walk through all the options to make the guy feel better.  They have to balance the safety of the subject, the safety of the public, and their own safety.  And they don't have all day to do it.
I feel bad for the guy for all the pepper spray he took, but he's going to be fine.  A good rinse with water and a couple of days of mild eye/nose/throat irritation and he'll be completely recovered.
He didn't get tazed and fall on his face on the concrete.  He didn't get beat with batons and boots.  And he didn't get shot.
"Oh, no!  They *pepper sprayed him*!"  A big boy like that?  It's just another story to tell.  He feels more of a burn at the gym every day from the looks of him.
Lol. Are we talking "I'm depressed" level of mental crisis or "presents imminent danger to himself or others" level of mental crisis? And more to the point, why would police not err on the side of the latter when called to a scene, given the relative costs? Another day, another non-issue, mendaciously framed by a media outlet
How long did negotiations occur before pepper spray was used?
Better idea:
Take the money you would have spent on cops, spend them on social workers who specialize in mental health issues.
Cut back on the number of cops and use them more for proper law and order issues instead of making them a catch-all for all our society's bullshit.
Lol, pepper spray is non-lethal.  Would people rather he be shot?  If you see the entire confrontation, he was violent, and was struggling with police officers.  Guaranteed most people couldn't have dealt with it, even "experts".
I don't rely on a snippet video of an incident to tell me the entire story of what transpired.
How are cops expected to show their authority if they can not pepper spray, taser, and fire guns randomly.
This guy was resisting arrest. I wouldn't call him "non-aggressive" as the writer of this shitty article does.
Man, I remember back in like '08 or '09 when a schizophrenic (off their meds) cut someone's head off on a Greyhound bus in Manitoba because the voices told them to. Back then, people were up in arms because the Police didn't take more action. Guess the big wheel in the sky really does keep on turning.
Pepper spray is about as non-lethal as you can get.
Nightstick? Made out of metal and durable.
Taser? Enjoy the potential heart arrhythmia (or testicular torsion if the leads end up on opposite sides of your junk and the current rips through your sack).
Gun? ...Yeah...
I'm not advocating for physical restraint to be the automatic go-to in situations like this. But an individual can present a very real danger (to themselves and others) and be mentally incapable of controlling their actions. In extreme situations, this kind of response (if not a more excessive response) is necessary for public protection. 
Should we cheer it on? No, absolutely not.
But for people sitting on the sidelines thinking that this situation could have been avoided through "more training" or "talking", and that the police are simply power-mad bullies, you simply do not get it. Police Officers get shit pay to put their lives on the line every day to deal with the ugly realities of the world so you and I don't have to. And I don't know how many off their meds schizophrenics any of you have spoken with (I'm at potentially two), but people who are experiencing a break from reality aren't exactly open to rational discourse.
At the end of the day, everybody went home alive and the suspect in question is being evaluated and treated. Only in our current weird timeline would that be considered as anything less than a "win" when looking at this situation.
Advocates for training.
Training: Cop Tasers the man instead.
More training ...no . More civilian oversight with the powers to fire the police officers
Maybe educate the public to stop calling police for mentally ill individuals.  
Seems it’s lose lose for all involved, and everyone has a better idea of how to handle it.  Perhaps call a hospital and have a nurse attend? Maybe just ask the person if there’s family to call rather than calling police?  Or just let the mentally ill person be?  
They’re part of our society, just leave them be.
This is dumb.  Cops don't decide to be pricks, because of a lack of training.  If you give money to cops to get more training, they're just going to spend it on cop toys.
Montreal cops are utterly incompetent, unprofessional and stupid as the day is long.
That so called "police officer" that should serve and protect should be fired.
Canadian Police be like
Racial profiling?- training 
Assault and battery?- training 
Pepper pray a passive person - straight to training!
>the most boring video game ever created:" Desert Bus.

“It’s miserable,” Joe says.
They should’ve mentioned that Penn & Teller originally released the game
u/loadingreadyrun makes it to the front page of r/Canada!
What else could it have been but 'Desert Bus for Hope'...
Much love for Loading Ready Run, they have a small, but consistent fan base.
Not often that I see my favourite YouTube/Twitch streamers mentioned outside of my usual circles.  Good job LRR!
Great story!
So they were playing Overwatch?
Anyone impressed by Loading Ready Run's efforts here that is perhaps interested in seeing what else they do, I highly recommend Road Quest. A proper season's worth of Grand Tour inspired driving that takes them over 3,000 km as they experience a lot of interesting parts of the country. Really scratches that travel itch.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFVMs4Ru\_jI
Huge fan of this. They helped me propose to my wife a few years ago, and they continue to play a role in our story.
It's insane to think that they are now raising 50x the amount they raised in their first year.
I’ve always loved the desert bus charity. I tune in to their stream of it every year.
Jokes on them: you're not allowed to drive for 16 hours in one day.
That's technically not correct. The game that DB was a part of was never formally/officially released. They had it made as a counterpoint to some US politician's stance on video games I believe. LLR did get Pen and Teller to do an interview for the DB documentary a few years back.
Maybe Extra Life? Even then they're allowed to play better games...
Isn't is more "you're not *allowed* but you damn well better and fudge your logs to make deadline!"
They take shifts.
For a while they broke the 16h rule, but now they follow labour laws... some of them.
The original one was part of a collection called "smoke and mirrors" for the Sega CD, however the company that was making it went bankrupt before it was released. It got leaked, and the telethon event was playing this mini game.
If I remember correctly, it was designed as a FU to Janet Reno. 
A couple years ago there was a remake of this, called "Desert Bus VR" that is available for free on steam. (You don't need a VR headset to play, but you can use one).
Jack Thompson wasn't really a politician... more of an Activist Lawyer.
this was well before Jack Thompson became anything.
So what's their plan for intercepting Russia when they challenge our air space? Which they do a few times a year. It would be one thing if they wanted to down size the purchase to a number sufficient for domestic defence only, but to outright cancel replacing planes that are half ready to fall out of the sky is absurd. 
A functioning military is a like a fire extinguisher. I'd far rather pay for it and not need it than need it and not have it.
>88 fighter jets at a cost of $19 billion.
Damn that's cheap, only about 0.05 CERBs.
Advanced jet fighters are absolutely crucial to addressing climate change.  Any real action needs to be global and requires the American hegemony to push it onto the world.
You think China and Russia are going to do anything about climate change? Not unless we force them to.
Let the darn hornets go! We can't continue flying yesterday's aircraft today...
China and Russia approve of this protest.
Don’t buy jets because of the extreme weather in BC… ok
headdesk.jpg
No one tell them about the Navy
They don't have a plan.  They expect us to use our current and practically falling out of the sky jets.
Their plan is to ask them nicely not to fly in our airspace
They will obviously protest Russia for their climate destroying aircraft.
"what's their plan for intercepting Russia when they challenge our air space?"
We can just let the Americans defend our air space. I like to rant in my spare time about the dangers of U.S. imperialism, but I'm willing to look the other way this time since it would allow me to maintain my unilateral opposition to any weapons of war.
Lmao you act like our insignificant airforce is the only thing stopping Russia from a full scale invasion.
>You think China and Russia are going to do anything about climate change?
They're doing lots already, by helping to push the radical climate change agenda behind the scenes in Western countries. Anything to further weaken the West from within.
Then feel apologetic.
The US had no incentive to protect us. They have already said so numerous times.
Just wait till Trump is back in power, and decides to get back at "two-faced" JT.
They're not. NORAD is. The point is still the same - with nothing to intercept with, what's their plan? invasion or no, Russia tests our air space multiple times a year.
They have incentive to do the minimum to protect North American airspace. Even if Alaska wasn't their territory they would still need to guarantee Russian aircraft didn't  come into their sphere of influence.
Now it would be far better if Canada did its share in helping protect that space. I mean what would be next? Allowing U.S. airbases on our soil?
Okay and? Such a weird paranoia to think Russia or any nation 'testing' our airspace is meaningful to any capacity. I mean you seriously think the biggest issue in such a ridiculous event like war would be our lack of 80 f35s. The state of absolute disarray the world would need to be in for that to occur is completely unrealistic and jets would be our last concern.
The French language and priorities are already more than promoted with our current federal government.
Nobody gives a shit

If we want French to be spoken by most Canadians, then French needs to be learned in primary and carried on until University. Children need to speak to each other in both French and English casually for true fluency.
At this point the only thing that could supplant English as the *lingua franca* would be something like Esperanto that would only be adopted world-wide specifically for equality reasons to not favour any one group. With the inertia of English that exploded from the availability of the internet in ALL fields, it's extremely unlikely to ever be supplanted.
Doesn't mean people shouldn't be invested in maintaining their other languages at all, but the future of Earth is English and we're trending closer every year to being a monoculture (which should be great for world peace at the least).
As always, r/Canada turns to bigotry when it comes to French.
I wouldn’t say that.
Ah! So the vast majority of canadians can speak fluently in both french and english then?
>French people
You mean Francophone Canadians? Last I checked, French nationals can’t just take over jobs in public service.
Can you even imagine what a colossal waste of time and effort that would be.
Does this happen anywhere in Canada? Where kids speak to each other in both French and English or code-switch in everyday usage? I'm thinking in Ottawa area along the Quebec, Ontario border and Montreal or with bilingual parents?
Get over it and stop crying. There is no bigotry because we don't care for a language that isn't used in more than half the country.
Well... Not *just* the French
Why is that necessary or even desirable?  Isn't the whole point of official bilingualism to minimize the number of Canadians that need to learn a second language?
There are few reasons to learn French if you live out west. Nobody uses it. I am currently learning 2 other languages but will most likely never learn French. The only reason to learn French is to work for government or join the military but outside of that it is rarely used out west.
That was never the goal. I don't need to learn French. It serves no purpose for me. 
If Quebec's goal is for everyone to know French, then they are dreaming.
It's a huge waste of time. I didn't realise how shit school was, trying to understand biology in French immersion, until I traveled abroad and went to an English speaking school. I learned so much more and the French my friends learned was garbage compared to Quebec, let alone actual French.
Except it's not, bilingualism is a massive asset for employment and academic opportunities.
Also in rural New Brunswick.
Not kids, but it was done at the St-John military college in Quebec some years ago. I don't know if they still do, or if it was done in the other colleges, but Canadian officers graduating from there were all bilingual at the end of their military training.

However it really went did anyone expect the lie master Kenney to come out and say "it went shitty they hate me I'll be out by next summer."
Kenney is done like dinner, because of his weak leadership.  He tried to ride the fence on Covid and it blew up in his face spectacularly. 
There was a ton of eye rolling in the cities at the end of June when the “Best Summer Ever” was announced. That turned into anger and contempt in September when the fourth wave spiked. Then he pissed off most of the rural areas when he implemented new restrictions and the vaccine passport rules. 
There is no coming back from this; he’s done.
What an indictment of humanity, if true
Hahaha I'll just leave this here, not looking good for you bud

He's a victim of his religion because it doesn't him to be true to himself and live openly as a gay man.
Open for Christmas!!!!  - Also Kenney.

Nope. It has to be called within 18 months.
Normally I would agree that today's polls don't mean much in that time frame, but we are still going to have Covid for a long while yet, and on top so much of what Kenney is doing to contribute to his unpopularity is not Covid related and was going on before the pandemic.
If the UCP dumped Kenney, then I could see the UCP numbers recover, but with him staying, I think they are done in 2023.

Almost no boot sole made of just rubber is going to be good on ice. My coworker has a pair of boots that have metal flakes embedded in the rubber, they are awesome on ice. 
Not so awesome on his hardwood floors when he forgot about them though. Oops.
Merrell has gone down hill in the last few years, they used to be one of the best trekking footwear companies around, but the last two pairs I have purchased will be the last. Like anything else, everything is made to fall apart, just buy the products you have to and buy to most durable you can
We call them crampons, I assume this means ice cleats. There is literally nothing better. I can run down a hill with inches of ice. With ease. They pull off the bottom of my boots when I get inside.
Merrell boots used to be well made, now their low-cut have shit for anti-slip resistance and they are sold at $180 a pair! They cut quality of material and resort to BS to sell. I stopped buying their product since and replaced them with ECCO, their product has amazing anti-slip material.
The amount of women's boots that have NO proper traction or some fucking flower design on the tread that does nothing for functionality is so infuriating. I spend a lot of time outside in all seasons with my Labrador, not sure why women's boots are still mostly made for fashion. My current pair is Kamik but I've also had luck with Sorel and Merrell.
Here are the full results from the organization that CBC engaged with for the test, KITE Research Institute: [https://ratemytreads.com/](https://ratemytreads.com/)
I wonder how long ICEFX, Green Diamond technology or Vibram Arctic Grip soles last? That is, they may grip the ice, but wear out faster? It doesn't sound like the lab tested that.
It might be better to buy crampons and just use them as needed (unless you live in a place that doesn't treat the sidewalks).
Tom Scott did a cool [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1oRaUTbk3k) on the lab that does the testing, winter lab. The researcher he interviews is an absolute brutally honest legend. Also here the complete [list](https://ratemytreads.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Complete-RMT-Footwear-Tested-Updated-Nov-14-2021.pdf) of testing results.
Most construction grade boots are pretty good since they’re made so you don’t slip and get time off or sue the general contractor for not keeping the job site snow cleared which becomes ice very quickly. There’s also boots with shards of glass in the treads that work pretty good.
My Baffin boots have taken me across frozen lakes and sketchy snow ice on walks countless times. Highly recommend. And I’m clumsy.
IceTrekker boot chains are awesome if you’re looking to nonslip your winter walking.
It's the next Canadian crisis
https://ratemytreads.com is the brains behind this article and has ratings for a lot of popular boot models.
Last year I used them to pick a new pair of deep winter boots and decided on the Helly Hansen Lockdown’s. Couldn’t be happier with them.
I lived in Edmonton for 5 years and after falling on my ass so often in the first two years, it became a game with me to get through the winter without slipping and falling.  I made it 2 of the 3 remaining winters.
What I should have done was either invest in some proper winter traction or a hockey helmet.  I see folks making jokes about this but all you have to do is bounce your head off the ice once to realize it's no joke.
Yak Traxs are your friend
Ice is slippery.
Who knew?
if you want to not slip on ice buy crampons.
ETA: https://www.amazon.ca/b?ie=UTF8&node=2439528011
Get traction cleats or ice grips if you just want to walk on ice? The vast majority of people who buy winter boots aren't looking to literally walk on ice.
I swear by my Windriver boots.  They're not the same model as was used in this test but I walked 5 miles per day outside in all sorts of crap over the last few years and they never let me down.   They were comfortable and they keep the water out so I wouldn't think twice about a new pair.  My wife even started stealing them
I switched from Merrell to the Solomon X Ultra two years ago and haven't looked back since. Amazingly lightweight for the amount of warmth, comfort and waterproofness. Haven't slipped yet, either
The decision to prosecute -- or not -- is a matter of core Crown discretion, and reviewable by the courts only for abuse of process (a very high standard). I'm not aware of any precedent whatsoever to suggest the refusal to prosecute an offence could even qualify as an abuse of process (since it is, effectively, a refusal to engage in process at all, it's not clear how it could be an abuse of a process it doesn't engage).
Whether you agree with Alberta's decision or not (and I expect a good deal of us won't), this is just BC blowing smoke at Alberta. There is virtually no chance that judicial review occurs or leads to a remedy.

Wow I'd never seen this story. That's some shocking misconduct / assault. 
I agree with your assessment. Wonder what the next step is, if there can even be one?
If you or I put a can of whup-ass on someone stealing a vehicle and it was caught on video like this, you'd be charged immediately and the charges would go to court.  Nothing like having a job where you are immune to criminal penalties.  Hold the police to a higher standard my ass.
all you do is post woke social justice crap no one with a job, who doesn't smell like cat piss and box wine cares about your daily job of posting divisive garbage..
I support cans of whup-ass being opened when someone is stealing a car.
Lol.
So you are arguing it's fine for cops to break the law and abuse people is that it?
Very nice.
It's a good look, I assure you.

It sickens me that Trudeau is exploiting her heritage in order give the illusion of virtue. It would be a lot more appropriate if his political career had not been plagued by cultural insensitivity (Costumes, Reconciliation Day surfing, etc).
Cool.
A part of Canada's cultural heritage.

The Gov. Gen. throne speech in her native language.
Honest question: I've heard accusations of virtue signalling against everyone about everything. In Trudeau's case, what would not be virtue signalling? When is an attempt at being better legitimately recognized?
Very cool.
When you don't continuously make culturally cringy or insensitive remarks. 
Like, blackface two or three times. Or for me, as someone from partial-Indian background, that cringy photo op he did.
That's fair, and those were stupid decisions he made. To play devils advocate for the sake of my question however, he has apologised and made efforts to improve, hasn't he? I think from your statement, that no matter what he does to improve, it will always just be virtue signaling because he did bad things before. When is he redeemed in your eyes? 
Ps. Thank you for your response. To remind, I want to have a good faith discussion about this sensitive subject, as I'm just trying to improve my own understanding so that I can do better as an individual.

Amazing how quickly people have gone from "Keep the Americans out!" to "We need to buy gas and food in Washington!"
I hope the British Columbians notice how nice Washingtonians are to them not only in their time of need but generally.
Stop this bullshit. End all restrictions.
TLDR
> Residents in B.C. border communities who are in need of gas and other essential goods will be allowed to cross the border to the U.S. and return without requiring a COVID-19 test or quarantining, a federal update on the flooding in the province was told Sunday
> "People are concerned about crossing the border because of the COVID restrictions that are in place," said Blair, adding he spoke with B.C. Public Safety Minister Mike Farnworth about concerns over fuel shortages.
> individuals who live close to border communities would be able to go into the U.S. to fuel their vehicles, and upon their return be exempt from having to get a molecular test for the virus.
> to be very clear, those **exemptions do not apply to non-essential travel. It does apply to people who are required to travel over into the United State in order to access essential goods and services, but it does not include family trips, vacations or other types of tourist activity**
Hopefully that will ease some of the pressure on supply lines.  I was surprised to get a FedEx delivery yesterday.  I checked on Friday and all the routes were still closed.
In other parts of the world, the death toll from flooding like this would have been much higher and the time to recover much longer.  There's still a tremendous amount of work to do, but it's proceeding at a steady clip.
It was only months ago that Left-wing Canadians were bleating about keeping Americans out and making excuses for vandalism to cars with American license plates. There was also special schadenfreude for those in Point Roberts.
Now, when Canadians are in need, they suddenly expect the Americans to be their salvation. It’s really fucking pathetic.
Good to see the virus will give them a break.  It’s science.
Good. This is a disaster that straddles both sides of the US-Canada border, and it requires a US-Canada solution.
There is an exception to every rule.
Great to see Trudeau giving a break to the COVID hysteria so that the folks in BC can get relief.
The Canadian government is truly gracious! All hail to Tam and Trudeau saviours against corona!
BC should separate and join the USA. Quebec is already a nation, Saskatchewan is next. Canada is going downhill fast.
lol no
The restrictions were literally going to be lifted in eight days anyway. Otherwise I would agree and say that the border should remain closed.

Why would the US want a province full of NDP voters and crumbling infrastructure?
Would suck for all those bc people to lose their healthcare...
Separation or not, I've been thinking that if infrastructure continues to be strained, then we'll just naturally start relying on the more geographically feasible Cascadia region for trade and resources.
Yes!
>intergenerational trauma
If this were a thing then it applies to almost everyone on the planet. Ever hear of WWII? The Holocaust? The Holodomor? The Cultural Revolution? Khmer rouge? Armenian genocide? Darfur?
Why do we infantilize indigenous Canadians as the only group unable to overcome historical trauma?
>"We are calling on you to take steps to have those documents returned to Canada. The Vatican may claim diplomatic immunity, but this cannot be used to screen crimes against children," the MPs state in the letter.
Actually, yes it does. Diplomatic immunity means diplomatic immunity, for everything. Russia has used it to protect their diplomats from homicide and DUI charges in other countries. NDP once again showing their complete naivety and not understanding how the real world works.
Am I the only one to think that the  British Crown/Canadian Gov. have equal responsibility with the Church in this?
It is amazing that this term seems to be exclusively applied to FN for some reason. Meanwhile the rest of the world has experienced tragedy and yet this concept is never applied. It's a very strange double standard.
Too many people on the gravy train to give it up.  What better way to secure your future than to come up with trauma that is somehow passed down to subsequent generations.
Also, if you tell indigenous people that because their parents/grand parents experienced trauma, that they will "inherit" it, what kind of a message are we telling them?  Instead of saying, "You can do it!", we're saying, "You're fucked from birth."
> Why do we infantilize indigenous Canadians as the only group unable to overcome historical trauma?
Because most other people that go through hard times had to work through it otherwise they would get zero support and starve on the streets.
Nowadays you need to be a protected class in order to receive extra support.
One great-grandparent of mine was under the constant threat of firebombing for years on end, not knowing if the bombing raid that night would raze their homes to the ground. Then the foreign armies came through and raped & pillaged their way through (and many neighbours raped to death), so they fled at night leaving everything behind. Had to hide on their way out of their former country to avoid being used to death. Ended up losing half her remaining family to a landmine. Eventually came to Canada and re-built from scratch, and didn't live on the streets blaming the world for their problems.
Another was sent to a Siberian workcamp from 1943 to 1954 after suffering through several years on the eastern front. Teeth with fillings ripped out upon camp entry, infections were rampant, suffered from frostbite, and used as a literal work mule. Others in this camp resorted to cannibalism due to lack of food (though he said he never did, which I don't know if that is true...). Came back in 1954 to find his former home was no longer even in the same country as his and occupied by a strange family, and tried to find his family. Eventually found them, made it to Western Germany and then eventually to Quebec. Made their way to Manitoba a few years later with the promise of opportunity and resulted in my family tree.
They didn't receive support here and definitely would not have received support in Europe or the Soviet Union, and they experienced more trauma than most would ever see in lifetimes.
Is it infantilizing or realistic though?
You can overcome trauma pretty quickly if you have the means. But a reserve really doesn't seem to be good for the people who live there. I wouldn't want that for me.
Basically if you put two people through trauma, and one of them makes decent money and the other doesn't. Guess where more emotional support from therapists and social circles come from.
The NDP knows that, they also know that their voters don't and furthmore that they won't fact check them. That's why they say dumb stuff like that, it's not because the millionaire champagne socialists are dumb.
I'm confused as to what does the Vatican has to do with this? The vast majority of church records are not kept by them and it's basically down to whoever is in charge in that area to provide documents. A quick Google search shows the documents are in the Oblates archives in Rome.
I think the Crown and government have even greater responsibility than any of the churches involved. The government was the organization that rounded up Indigenous kids under the threat of violence, and packed them into living conditions where they would predictably die of TB at outrageously high rates. It was the government that then ignored reports of the kids dying at outrageously high rates, denied any funding to improve the conditions, and prohibited any further research into the conditions at the residential schools. Those actions were responsible for the vast majority of the residential school deaths, and they were genocidal completely independently of the other abuses that took places at the schools.
Anyone who suggests that the Crown bears responsibility gets downvoted into oblivion. Our media elite must still be loyal to the Crown.
Nope. They do. In fact, on a number of occasions, they pushed additional responsibilities on to the churches delivering the program over their objections and without adequate funding. They absolutely bear some responsibility, but the Crown is the agent with primary responsibility.
Probably not equal as most of the Residential School System was put in place and operated after 1867.
> Am I the only one to think that the British Crown/Canadian Gov. have equal responsibility with the Church in this?
I don't think that's controversial, it's just that the gov. has taken some steps to apologize and work towards reconciliation while the church has historically, largely failed to do anything but hide and lie.
> It's a very strange double standard.
Canada in a nutshell.
If they are now in Rome, they are now under the sovereign control of the Vatican, and as they are an independent state, untouchable from Canadian legal jurisprudence.
(Even if physically in Italy, under the terms of the Lateran Treaty, Italy recognizes Vatican properties outside the physical walls of Vatican City as sovereign Vatican territory, similar to an embassy).
I totally agree with you.  The church was only the vehicle behind the idea.
The British started a while back with the Quebeckers and the Acadians
Edit: and obviously mass murder on natives again before the 1800s
> Our media elite must still be loyal to the Crown.
I don’t think that's it....
It’s called guilty by association
They're under obligation to release anything by law indeed.
What I mean to say is that orders have final say on their books, even if the Vatican authorizes the release of a document it's no guarantee that whoever is doing the local record keeping will release it. So the MPs taking the issue with the Vatican, it's very naive indeed, in addition to your point about jurisprudence.
Maybe they're just not approaching this correctly. Church entities in Italy are generally willing to work with researchers in archival projects. They might have a better chance of success by working with a local researcher on a digitalization project as opposed to asking for the originals to be returned.
> That fully-vaccinated Conservative MP Richard Lehoux was diagnosed with COVID-19 over the weekend became swift political ammunition for rival parties.
Ummm.... Why? Opposition is aware that fully vaxxed people can still get COVID right? I didn't read anything in the article that seems to indicate a real problem here.
Someone fully vaccinated caught COVID. So what? Will happen to all of us sooner or later. 
Remember those ministers who tested positive a couple of weeks ago? No? Me neither because after the initial breathless media reporting they quietly recovered.
I hate how the media keep stoking the COVID drama.
Scraping the barrel here, high quality journalism from the Star as always
Is it even true if it’s not the Beaverton?
Maybe it’s just me being an old man yelling at clouds but it seems to me that most of the major media outlets produce literal crap.
Why is that not barricaded permanently by now?

Holy fuck what are these idiots doing? Cost of living is skyrocketing, inflation is climbing rapidly and there is no where for these people to live.
Why can't we have a national talk on subjects like this?
The liberals love to see all these illegal border crossers.
Liberals could save a lot of money if they just disbanded immigration and border security.  Since they don't care about people coming here illegally there's no real use for them.

Never knew this place existed but for a second it looked like they are entering a resort..
Edit: Out of curiosity searched this place on Google Maps.. the US side ends with few stop signs but on The Canadian side we seem to built an proper office of sorts for processing such refugees?? There are few polics cars also parked! 
Wonder how much money could be saved by just permanently barricading the road!!
Maybe we could hire some consultants from Poland to teach us how to secure our borders.

Uhhh.... didn't they leave because of trump? With biden in office they have no reason to come here unless of course they're looking for a free lunch

**translation**:
>Since Sunday morning, migrants from the United States can again file an asylum application through an irregular entry point such as Roxham Road.
>Located at the Canada-US border, in Saint-Bernard-de-Lacolle, Roxham road had been closed since the end of March 2020 "for public health reasons". With rare exceptions, those who had attempted this route for the last eight months were returned to the United States.
>Since this temporary change did not benefit the United States, they have asked Canada to resume welcoming these irregular migrants, according to Simon Ross, press secretary to Quebec Federal Minister Pablo Rodriguez.
>As Canada has resumed welcoming foreign travelers, Ross said, it would be frowned upon to turn back asylum seekers upon arrival in the country citing the COVID-19 pandemic as the reason.
> Ottawa therefore amended its "Order on Reducing the Risk of Exposure to COVID-19 in Canada" on Saturday. It now states that anyone seeking to enter Canada from the United States in order to apply for asylum is no longer subject to it.
> The Canadian government expects the number of irregular asylum seekers to increase, but not as large as in 2017 and 2018.
> In those years, tens of thousands of people had arrived illegally in the country, most of them via Roxham Road, because they feared being deported to their countries of origin due to the anti-immigration policies of the Trump administration.
>In comparison, between April 2020 and last July, just under 25 asylum seekers were intercepted on average each month by Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers. They were nearly a thousand a month before the pandemic.
>Many migrants attempt to enter Canada irregularly due to constraints resulting from the Safe Third Country Agreement. In effect since 2004, this agreement signed with the United States obliges migrants to submit their asylum application in the first safe country they pass through.
>Thus, people living in or passing through the United States are prohibited from making a refugee claim in Canada.
>But this ban only covers legal requests made at border crossings, and not requests made after entering by an irregular path.
I think that guy in the picture already came in last year. Did he leave and come back again?
This is the US shirking their responsibilities and unsurprisingly breaking an agreement with Canada (yet again) now that it no longer benefits them.
They made Canada sign an agreement with them that refugees are to the responsibility of whichever nation they set foot in first, Canada or the US, when the flow was from people entering Canada then hopping over to the US. Now that it's the opposite, the US is pretending that agreement doesn't exist because they're a bunch of greedy assholes that use their power to bully weaker nations like us just for a bit more money in their already gold lined pockets.
How can Americans be considered refugees except in extreme circumstances (a whistle blower or natural disaster)?
Pass a law to return them to the USA. US is a safe country.
"The Canadian government expects the number of irregular asylum seekers to increase, but not as large as in 2017 and 2018."
Is this a joke
Canada is back!
Crumbling? Really?
Dont build a house in a dried out lake and you'll be fine.
I heard that dismantling rail lines and selling them off to developers or donating them to land-speedo freaks is the best way to prepare for climate change.
Once we start eliminating cars and trucks, **why adopt cargo, intercity or commuter rail when we can instead adopt poverty**?
That's the thing. We won't. We will continue to allow our infrastructure to crumble and not be updated meanwhile bringing in ever more immigrants to exacerbate the issue
Well we can’t build anything because all it takes is one First Nations band member to picket a railway, worksite or highway. Who in their right mind would invest in infrastructure in Canada.
Naw. Problem is Canada was built decades ago and there is no investment in infrastructure anymore. Why would anyone? Impossible to get done. Can be billions in and a few idiots can “protest” and the whole project gets scrapped
I know, we can give a bunch of tax breaks to Loblaws, and Bell, and our banks!! That will help.
Or perhaps Canada is obsolete, and that building back better means without Canada.
Our Canadian governments are too afraid to make decisions unless it’s out of urgent self-preservation. Perhaps it’s a mentality of fear and risk aversion. As a result, the national mindset needs to be overhauled or simply done away with.
A couple excerpts from the article:
&#x200B;
>And there is a plan afoot. Since 2016, the federal government has been working on a national plan for adapting to climate change, and working to update standards for building critical infrastructure such as roads, highway bridges, water and electrical systems, as well as for resilience against specific natural disasters such as fires and floods.  
>  
>The goal of this project was to have those standards completed by this year. Some guidance reports, including one on best practices for flood-risk reduction, and a technical guide for flood-resistant buildings were published in 2021. The national adaptation strategy, which will set out the responsibilities of all levels of governments in preparing for and responding to climate-related disasters, will not be finalized until the end of next year.  
>  
>Meanwhile, previous building codes, according to the government of Canada’s own website, are leaving the country’s most important transportation links and resource services vulnerable to disaster.  
>  
>That’s because they were based on historical climate data that just doesn’t stand up anymore, and, “In many cases, this has resulted in assets that have not been designed to withstand the extreme weather events we are currently seeing, let alone the future impacts of climate change.”
...
&#x200B;
>Eyquem said that building back stronger is not just a nice sentiment, but imperative to protecting people now and in the future.  
>  
>“Climate change is often seen as a future problem but, actually, it is a now problem,” she said. It’s affecting people’s health. It’s not an environmental issue only, and it’s adversely affecting people’s lives.”
less stroads might be a good start.

Canada is not crumbling. 
This is bull-shit fear mongering at this point. For what purpose? Canada *cant* improve infrastructure or energy because we *dont want to*. We will happily protest oil and gas- but we give zero consideration for a viable replacement. No one wants to throw money at our energy industry because they look at the mountain of bull-shit going on with making oil and gas sustainable here and *NOPE* right out.
We build homes and infrastructure in areas that *really shouldn't* have homes and infrastructure. When they get destroyed by weather we blame it on climate change instead of extremely poor planning.
We don’t. All our eggs is in real estate. Boomers are retiring so their nest egg is the governments priority. 
Imagine being apart of that pathetic generation
The rest of the world will work the land that was once Canada when the climate wars start in the next decade or so
Just when you think there's a toilet paper shortage.
To be fair though, if you wipe your ass with the Red Star, you're going to end up with more shit on your ass then you started with.
build back? with what money?
Isn't "build back" Biden's campaign slogan? Why is it used so much in Canada? Its an awkward sounding phrase seemingly chosen for  alliteration.
Was this a century flood or something?

This from the bank that fired my wife for being pregnant.  Screw them!
Edit:  To those asking, yes we know it’s illegal.  We started to fight it, but given the fact my wife was both pregnant and has anxiety issues she’s on meds for, she ultimately decided to just take the severance they offered because the idea of dealing with lawyers and court was too much.
As for the back story, my wife became pregnant shortly before starting a job with Scotia.  Her boss (who was also a woman) decided to pile on work on her when she found out that my wife was pregnant.  Basically created an increasingly stressful work environment for my wife.  Who’s pregnancy was making day to day life hard with nausea and various join swelling.
My wife was actually excited about this job and was planning on sticking it out with the company long term.  But then this happened.  Took her sometime to get over this.
Article Highlights:
* Canadians eyeing internships, co-op placements and graduate positions at Scotiabank no longer have to submit their resumes.
* “We are taking away any bias, which would be where did someone go to school, what jobs did they have before and what opportunities did they have or not have based on their upbringing or circumstances,” said James Spearing, Scotiabank’s vice-president of talent acquisition.
* Its new hiring processes has expanded to include the bank’s recruiting team using Plum’s platform to determine which requirements are most important for jobs they are looking to fill.
* Applicants then complete a Plum assessment with problem solving, personality and situational questions targeting those requirements.
* Applicants receive information on their talents, work style and preferences, while recruiters see a “match score” indicating each candidate’s potential fit with the role they are hiring for and other openings.
* But assessments can also be lengthy – Plum’s takes about 25 minutes \_ and sometimes software can have difficulties picking up on how transferable some skills are.
\----------------------------
*My thoughts:  Not everything on resumes is there because of privilege. Often, applicants have worked long and hard and shown initiative to achieve it's contents. i don't believe it should be excluded entirely from the hiring process.*
They still have the worst interview process I've ever been in, so whatever.
I don’t like this. I’ve always had way worse luck with jobs where you apply to their HR platform like they’re describing than ones where you submit a resume and an actual person reads it.
I'm positive that using bots to analyze on-line questionnaires and tests to hire low wage "customer service reps", will make banking at Scotia so much more enjoyable that we'll all want to open accounts there.
/s
They're doing away with the resume but banking is one of the most relationship/network driven careers out there. Guarantee this won't help Joey who went to Lakehead get a job at BNS as an investment banker.
I worked there as a financial advisor for almost a year
Dont do it
> “We are taking away any bias, which would be where did someone go to school, what jobs did they have before and what opportunities did they have or not have based on their upbringing or circumstances?” 
I work in banking IT and see co-op students in various teams.
It's mostly Chinese or Indian and they go through process that really picks best of the best and solid 80% of them usually are. Good number of them get a job as soon as they graduate. 
So, can someone explain to me what's the issue exactly?
Is this whole thing specifically designed to hire black students?
It's too bad, and I say this as a current customer, YOU SUCK ScotiaBank. My local one has only gotten worse and worse almost like they don't really want to do it anymore. The are only open Monday - Friday, 930 to 4. So any working folk can not go to the bank you need to take time off work or rush in on  a lunch break. But guess what they take lunch too so even fewer staff around that time. The whole thing is a shit show and maybe they have noticed my money slowly getting lower and lower, might be able to find it all at the local Credit Union where they don't suck. Sincerely, ticked off customer.
Smells like an excuse to hire under qualified non-citizens and receive subsidies from the government.
Doesn't surprise me.
Scotia has been bleeding bodies for about a year now, primarily because of low pay and awful work environment.
They need anybody with a pulse right now because the turnover is crazy
To any recent grads or the ones still in school, I wouldn't work for any of the big 5 banks. Outdated tech (but improving), working environment/micromanagement,  and extremely outdated salary structures. 
You can meet all the requirments for a role somewhere down the line but your application will be ignored because your current internal salary band is three levels lower than the role you are applying to. They treat that as the ultimate deciding factor.
The good thing is you will have security since they didnt have a single layoff suring the pandemic. Record profits IIRC
“We are taking away any bias, which would be where did someone go to school, what jobs did they have before and what opportunities did they have or not have based on their upbringing or circumstances?” said James Spearing, Scotiabank’s vice-president of talent acquisition.
Oh good the company that leaves me on hold for 2 hours is hiring more people to leave me on hold for 2 hours.
Scotia is an absolute shit bank.
I bet that hiring pool is wider, but not as deep.
… not that new hires fresh out of school bring much depth these days, anyway.
Thats illegal.
What??
Usually employers don’t fire someone for being pregnant. Probably more to the story.
It's a shitty situation all around.  Scotiabank's behavior was poor in how they handled letting her go but it's also shitty to deal with someone who is pregnant getting a job to exploit the mat leave shortly after starting.  
I understand the person exploiting is also just trying to get by likely so it's not that I don't understand that position.  However all this does is remind employers why they need to be vigilant and cautious hiring women.  If they need to hire women it's better to focus on 40+ age as the chances of this happening are much lower.
Just what I want when it comes to handling my money.
If you’d rather lose your job then get a needle, then really there’s no hope for you. 
There’s lineups around the block for replacements - no great loss!
Cue the “good we hate those worthless pieces of shit” comments
Any lawyer that takes these things to court is unscrupulous to the max, willing to cash in on a hopeless battle and taking their payday from the soon to be unemployed.
Every reputable lawyer that I have seen weigh in with an opinion has been unanimous that these mandates are legal, that there is precedent for them in our laws, and that they will certainly withstand Charter challenges.
It's sad how desperately gullible the people who are afraid of the vaccine are.
Huge service cuts have been made in Toronto because of this policy.
This ruling doesn't address the core issue. I don't understand why we can't accelerate an upper court ruling on the legitimacy of the actual mandates. This is a real question employers, unions, employees, and really the nation needs to better understand right now. 
Injunction to delay, to appeal process is not suitable for such an important and far reaching decision. 
To me it seems the supreme Court really should be hearing arguments on this immediately and give us a resolution on this.
They said the same thing about NYC cops (hundreds won’t show up To Work)  and only 18 officers were impacted
I can't imagine the kind of loser that only waits for headlines like these to know where and when to apply for jobs, and they STILL get rejected (as is proper). 
Reading a reply like this would probably get them very angry.
Good. They have the worst union members at union station who sit on a chairs all day, and when you ask them a question they react like you asked for their kidney.
The vaccine won't cure the virus, but it will keep the hospitals from overloading.

Yet another good opportunity for employment for (vaccinated) people who are looking for work.
I did so enjoy my last few paychecks of the year without CPP, soon to be a thing of the past, like disposable income
Isnt it great, inflation, more taxes, higher cpp contributions, our rich politicians are so good, they should vote themselves another raise
It means one more hit in the wallet, on top of everything else.
It just keeps piling on.
So because of a methodological quirk where average wages increased last year because low wage workers weren’t working due to lockdowns, we are all paying 5% more in to this next year? 
Unbelievable.
It also means reduced cash flow now hoping you live to collect CPP.
CPP needs to be cohort dependent.  you cannot have intergenerational transfer through the CPP.
oldie money is gone, oldie needs more money, get it from other oldies.
the old people have all the money, stop financing their retirement off minimum wage slaves.
this all goes back to inflation and interest rates, which are all set up to help.... old people.
Article Highlights:
* **The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) earnings ceiling is increasing at the highest rate in 30 years, a change that will provide a boost to benefits for new retirees and a hit for workers and businesses contributing to the plan.**
* The earnings cap, called yearly maximum pensionable earnings or YMPE, is set to rise to $64,900 for 2022 from $61,600 for 2021, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) announced on Nov. 1. That’s a 5.3 per cent increase, the largest percentage change since 1992.
* The change will boost benefits for retirees who start claiming CPP benefits in 2022 or later but also result in significantly larger contributions for workers and employers paying into the pension plan.
* The spike in CPP premiums will hit workers at a time when they are feeling the squeeze of soaring consumer prices. The increase is particularly large for the self-employed, who pay both the employee and employer portions of CPP contributions.
* The unexpected jump reflects, in part, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused disproportionate job losses for low-earning workers, according to the Office of the Chief Actuary.
ITT: people who have 0 idea how the CPP works and don't realize that not only is it extremely well funded it holds extremely valuable assets and is sustainably growing its worth for steady cash outflows. 
It went from being scarcely funded to the complete opposite in a span of almost 20 years, literally 1000% growth over this period. So yeah, the CPPIB does a better job at growing OUR collective book than any one of you complainers here, for our future personal financial security.
Edit: a word
Why not just call it a tax like it is.
Ah yes, more negative impact to my life to support boomers.
So let me get this straight. On one hand people are bitching about Baby Boomers and their golden DB Pension plans and then on the other hand they bitch about being involved in a DB Plan like the CPP that is expertly run, well funded and healthy as a fucking horse. Did you think that those Baby Boomers just cruised through life, didn't pay a dime into their DB Plans and retired with a golden handshake? FFS people.
The first of many tax/government increases coming our way.
Contrary to the rest of this sub….good.
You won’t be complaining about this when you retire. People rarely love to pay anything. Its the reason why voluntary ei contributions didn’t work even though this system was in place pre-covid.
A lot of people here don't seem to understand what Ponzi and pyramid schemes are.

Good thing Justin and Jagmeet are not worried about monetary policies! 🤡‘s.
I always celebrate that glorious week when I exceed CPP/EI limits and get to keep more of the take home pay I've worked for.
Sucks that it keeps getting further and further into the year with the earnings cap going up as much as it has.
From 1.8% of salary to 5.95% of salary with an additional 4% at a second higher cap.
On and on it goes, where it stops nobody knows.

Retraining programs are good. As long as we keep letting companies seek maximum profit incentives at the expense of this country and the people who work for them, they'll continue to screw over Canadians. Since neither the liberals or conservatives are going to change that any day soon, and the NDP isn't getting into government anytime soon, then at least we'll be helping out those loosing jobs.
Just wait until automated trucking comes into play at some point in the next few decades and millions lose their jobs, I'd rather have concrete programs to retrain and aid them, in place already when that comes to pass
The oil industry will inevitably die. The burning then flooding of BC should be more than enough of an example of climate collapse. As for electric cars, get used to it. By 2030, there will be more electric cars being sold in Canada than poison farting combustion engine cars.

Well, yeah.  If you are looking to an early election and want to be reelected into the Liberal's ranks again.  The auto plants are cess-pits of NDP-voting ridings.  Justin can't "you hate gun control and abortion!!!11!!" his way out of those kinda realities.
Honestly, this title got me, shits was hilarious.
Um no. They are probably disgusted at Canada as a country and want nothing to do with us. It's hilarious that the world thinks Canada is a nice place and isn't using millions of people on slave wages to prop up the wealthy corporate/political class. The liberal propaganda machine was so strong virtue signalling around the world people actually think we are a left wing country 😂. As if our pm doesn't wear blackface, sexually assaul female reporters and doesn't sell out an entire generation making it so they will never be able to afford a home or family regardless of how hard they work or what profession they choose. Canada is a "you will own nothing and you will be happy" serfdom class neo feudalism country now. Canadians are imported as desperate immigrants or born here poor to make somebody rich. That is their only values in the eyes of Canada and it's government. Yet no one seems to have told the world and immigrants only find this out when they get here.
Politicians are incentivized and motivated to only care about furthering their career
Trump slapped us around for the image-making he wanted, as he really went to town on Mexico, and especially China.  Recall he kept a merry-go-round of it up with us, while we were only tangentially harmed.
Binden on the other had has embraced Trump's "Buy American" wholeheartedly, seeing in it the powerful political support it gave an idiot like Trump even.  They're always thinking about the next election.  To Biden, Canada is the perfect patsy while he moves to cement over the cracks that Trump drove into their China relationship.
To Trudeau, his eye is on some ephemeral history lesson that will be taught in 30 years time that he was a visionary (regardless of the harm that he will do in the meantime).
Bad news is, he is only on the "collapse the carbon industry" side of the equation.  Justin hasn't progressed far enough in arithmetic to comprehend you need something to balance out the energy-use side of it.

All made in China and assembled in Canada. To finance this we'll just have to sell off what's left of our country's housing, land, and resources.

Except it doesn’t really work and there has been studies done on so called retraining initiatives from the 90s on which really did nothing…a quick google search for study link
https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/15/us/us-study-says-job-retraining-is-not-effective.html
Exactly... we don't want large sections of our population to become like the coal towns of the Appalachians.  We can't stop positive progress, so lets help Canadians adapt.
3 points which need to be mentioned based on your comment.
First, the Oil industry won't die. Will it pivot from mainly gasoline production to other uses? Yes. But the O&G industry is still needed in everything from pharmaceuticals to plastics and clothes. People who keep banging this "oil is on the decline!" Drum are delusional.  
Second, In 9 years EVs will outsell ICE vehicles is an ambitious feat and one that might not happen. 2020 sales in Canada were 1.303 million vehicles which is roughly 677k units less than 2019 which were 1.98 million. To think in 9 years the likes of Ford, Tesla, GM, VW group will produce 1 million units is a reach just for Canada.. and a far one at that. Use Ford as an example, their Lightning F150 EV had 167k pre orders in all of North America, less than 50k will be in all of Canada. And you think there will over 1 million EV sales in 2030? 
Third, the bill to update Canada's electrical infrastructure is pegged at 1 trillion dollars. To update everything we'd have to start now in order to meet the demands of 1 million EVs on the road and the power demands they require by 2030.
Electric cars take an incredible amount of resources to make and are made using an oil based infrastructure. Electric cars fixing the world's pollution problem is an illusion.
Amazing how the tune on trade war changes when it's Trudeau vs Trump and Trudeau vs Biden
Canada has interests as well. If the current Government does not look out for Canada, we have elected a weak government. We did not built a strong automotive sector in the past without threatening teriffs in the past. The USA needs Canada still and they should be reminded of that when they try to destroy our autosector with such policies.
Trudeau won't retaliate. /thread
If only we had a few things... like commodities...  that America really lacks in, that they depend on, and totally rely on canada to provide.
It puts the left in a weird position of going against collective progressive ideals to defend nationalist incomes.   Who wants to be seen as anti-electric /anti-environment, or anti-union-made?
The USA does not need Canada lmao. And if they did, they don’t need us to “agree” to anything because we desperately need them.
I’m guessing you mean oil? The US is effectively oil independent and self sufficient, and a net exporter of oil products. They do still import from Canada, saudis Mexico etc. Which they then refine and resell back to us in Canada or wherever else.
What on earth do we have that they don’t have?
Well the good news for them is that union-made thing is going to be gone. Senate will never pass it with that provision in.
Plus it would be very easy for Canada to agree to our own NA Union-made incentives that match.
Don't know why you put "agree" in quotes. Not once did I say agree. Said threaten teriffs, this is far from agreeing. We are one of the largest aluminum producers in the world, one of the largest soft lumber, Canada rival the states in wheat production, etc, etc,etc.Sure they don't exactly need to go to Canada but it's beneficial to have a friendly trading partner to the North than a trade war.
Oil, natural gas, and the big one.......  uranium.
> As several of those I spoke to pointed out, offering a similar tax advantage for Canadian-made cars would not have the same effect, due to our unequal market clout. And putting tariffs on American-built EVs would simultaneously be bad for both climate change and Canadian auto-parts producers.
I didn’t know how to write it, but I mean that the us doesn’t need our consent to take what they want from us. They either get it with enthusiastic consent or they   Get it anyways. Not sure how you think this power dynamic works but we’re the bottom. I know it hurts to hear as a Canadian lmao, but it’s just how it is.
lumber
Yeah, pointless as a retaliation measure but I would still say useful as a compromise measure.  
Much easier to justify in the States if Canada has also created incentives for EV cars that work the same. The union-made cars getting support on both sides of the border would have some form of the usual UAW-CAW mix that would ruffle few feathers.
You may want to learn a little history and how the first NAFTA was written.
Until the party whip tells them what to say / how to vote.

It's almost the end of November! Only going back now!
What, the lobbyists and party insiders?
Trudope forgot after the first 2seconds .
Unfortunately, Saskatoon and Regina MPs seem to all think they were sent from Kindersley. Buncha crazy socons sucking the dicks of oil execs full time.
Yep.
It sure as hell wasn't the voters who put them there - the party put them there for the easy grab of the ignorant voters.
Yes and no.  The whip is definitely too influential in Canadian politics, but MPs still have plenty of ways to represent the interests of their constituents and bring concerns to the attention of their party leadership/the government.
Even without the existence of party whips, "remembering your constituents" wouldn't necessarily mean voting how they want on every issue.
"I'll never forget the lobbyists and donors who paid for my attack ads during the campaign. Without them, I wouldn't be here."
I mean he remains quite popular in Papineau, so his constituents seem to disagree with you, by and large.
You're dreaming.
>Even without the existence of party whips, "remembering your constituents" wouldn't necessarily mean voting how they want on every issue.
Uh, that's exactly what it means. Why the fuck would you vote for an MP that you expected to vote against your interests?
Really can't wait for these Hollywood stars to go over to Saudi Arabia and protest there....
I'm wondering who's gonna show support for the FN in favour of the pipeline. Including the locally elected band council who is in support.
He showed support from his private jet?
I think Leo's heart is in the right place and I don't get the cynical "this will be a good move for my career"  vibe from him that I get from a lot of Hollywood shitheads. 
But it's evident that he has little understanding of the complexity of the issue. The elected chiefs want to move ahead. The majority of the community wants to move ahead. The only people who do not want this fucking thing built are the professional activists and the group of hereditary chiefs who haven't been paid enough, in their judgement.
Dickhead. This guy has one of the highest carbon footprints of anyone in North America. 
Tweeting that shit from Bezos’ yacht.
Ugh.... I'm rooting for the bear from 'The Revenant' even more from now on.
Lol fuck off leo you don’t live here
It’s infuriating, I’m so angry our First Nations rights are consistently still not being respected by our government. 
The pipe company could take a different route for the pipeline to end the protests peacefully and respectfully today if they wanted to.
......
Traditionally the hereditary chiefs held meetings with the people to come to a consensus. Apparently in this case that isn't happening for some reason. In fact some hereditary chiefs  who agreed with the elected council to have the pipeline were ejected from the hereditary group.
I've been told the media attention and ill-informed activism is compounding the issue as the citizens want their disagreements kept private, so as a result they just keep quiet.
Don't worry, it burns non-GMO fuel
> But it's evident that he has little understanding of the complexity of the issue.
Given that he thought [Chinooks were evidence of climate change,](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/leonardo-dicaprio-chinooks-climate-change-1.3358972) I tend to agree with your assessment.
Or when he went down with the Titanic.
That's not really a valid perspective on this issue, I'm afraid. CGL HAS respected the First Nations along the entire route of the pipeline. All the relevant band councils have approved the project, and these protesters represent a significant minority within the affected communities. What's more, a significant number of the protesters aren't even members of the First Nation on whose territory these events are taking place. And even the ones that are are conducting themselves in a manner that goes against the laws and customs of the Wet'suwet'en. If anyone is not respecting the relevant First Nations, it's the protesters.
Which right? The right to democratic representation and community decision making?
Reminds me of the town council from the movie Hot Fuzz.
I think you’re invalid, confused and mistaken. The pipeline is being build illegally without their consent. 
https://grist.org/indigenous/wetsuweten-land-defenders/
Where are you getting your information?
I'm getting my information from the fact that I live in the region and also from a local elder who's been writing and compiling all the false information on these protesters for years now, under the following website:
[Viewpoint from the North](https://www.bc-north.com/)
It's laughable that you think the pipeline is being built illegally. Read [the press release found here](https://www.bc-north.com/2021/11/18/press-release-from-the-gidimten-clan/) from the Wet'suwet'en First Nation administration.
"Listen to the Indigenous people."   
"No!  Not *those* Indigenous people!"
Guess the perspectives of the 5 hereditary chiefs who oppose the decision are invalid, just like my opinion.
> One of the main causes of illiteracy is academic failure and school dropout. Quebec has the highest dropout rate in Canada with only 64 per cent of public high school students in Quebec graduating.
This surprised me.
[removed]
It's also wrong. The percentage was around 80.1% in 2015-2016. Source : [https://www.ledevoir.com/societe/education/521959/la-diplomation-au-quebec-decortiquee](https://www.ledevoir.com/societe/education/521959/la-diplomation-au-quebec-decortiquee)
This 64% is the percentage of student finishing it in the normal five years it's supposed to take. There's still 15% of students who need at least one more year.
Woah. That’s crazy
[removed]
Uninformed question: does this rate include cegep? Because if so its not apples to apples as most provinces got rid of their equivalents.
* in five years.
[removed]
> This 64% is the percentage of student finishing it in the normal five years it's supposed to take. There's still 15% of students who need at least one more year.
I'm curious to know how this compares to other provinces. It's also interesting that (as far as I'm aware), the other provinces in Canada do a four-year high school track.
EDIT: Looks like, in 2016, the only other province with a similar rate was Alberta (4 years) - https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/81-604-x/2018001/t/tbla2.1-eng.htm
This should be at the top
And also false. Check the other comments.
[removed]
[removed]
No. What it includes is students finishing in 5 years. 15% needs another year. So it ends up at around 80
lol. What.
>	 Off work at 3:30 for a fiesta. 
Lmao. That’s so far off from reality I don’t know what to say.
The general hours in Quebec are around 37.5 to 40 hours a week. Most people have 9-5 jobs dude there are no fucking fiesta at 3pm lol
The education system (like many, many other things) is different in Québec. 
Mandatory school : **Primaire** (elemantary) is 6 years long and **secondaire** (High school) is 5 years long.
Higher education : **CEGEP** (2 years if you go to university after OR 3 years if you do a ''technical program'')
It's not entirely false - just requires more context. Quebec still has the lowest on-time completion of high school (with one less year of schooling required for the qualification) of all the provinces. It's a real issue.
[removed]
Oh. That's also a very different end result than the original quote.
Oh no! Maybe the Feds should help the Canadians already struggling here? Lower class, middle-class Canadians. Mental Health services, improve health care services, dental care, housing issues. Hello?
I bet we didn't miss targets for wealthy investors
"Canadians struggle to meet ends for-ever?"
The refugee program should not have a path to citizenship, change my mind.
Who fucking cares. Less money coming out of my pocket.
How did they do for feeding and housing those that are here?
I'd rather we take more refugees and fewer rich foreigners.  Refugees will work hard and be grateful to Canada for saving their lives.
But that’s racist. /s
In before the liberals remove your comment, call you racist, send authorities to your home, and warn you if you dare question their enrichment of their buddies again you will go to prison for hate speech. Also do you own any guns because they are taking them. Nobody will threaten their slave ownership.
Exactly. It's hilarious that the world thinks Canada is a nice place and isn't using millions of people on slave wages to prop up the wealthy corporate/political class. The liberal propaganda machine was so strong virtue signalling around the world people actually think we are a left wing country 😂. As if our pm doesn't wear blackface, sexually assaul female reporters and doesn't sell out an entire generation making it so they will never be able to afford a home or family regardless of how hard they work or what profession they choose. Canada is a "you will own nothing and you will be happy" serfdom class neo feudalism country now. Canadians are imported as desperate immigrants or born here poor to make somebody rich. That is their only values in the eyes of Canada and it's government. Yet no one seems to have told the world and immigrants only find this out when they get here.
Are those federal or provincial responsibilities?
Refugees aren't the type that usually have much choice. 
Unless you mean stay in a refugee camp in a country actually falling apart at the seams or leave everything behind and come to Canada. 
I've heard stories of the journey from a few refugees and it's pretty fucking crazy and not the type of thing that most of us can even begin to wrap our heads around.
rich foreigners bring their money with them and spend it here.They are usually highly educated and end up being prized taxpayers. We need a lot of them. But we can also welcome refugees too.
Former Refugee. Can confirm.

So, everyone wants groceries, but no one wants to run a grocery store. Sounds like the situation has reached its predictable ending.
The store is closing because the owners are retiring and can't find anyone to run the store.
This is surprising.
They can't find anyone to buy the store from them?  That can't be it, because they're closing the store and making $0 from that.
So implication is that they literally can't profitably hire someone as "store manager" who would do all the buying and hiring and scheduling and such.
It’s a fairly run down store when you actually get inside. I could imagine someone wanting to start fresh with a new building to put a grocery store in there.
There would be demand for a grocer in that town, not only from St. Isidore but from a few smaller towns around it that don’t have one either.
Edit: spelling
[deleted]
OK, I had to see where that town was located on Google....
I was expecting it to be really isolated, and people struggling to buy food and shit.
It's just outside ottawa,  it's only 15km away from the next town with like 10x the population.  LOL.
Well, as someone from Toronto, I can share some of the wisdom that the rest of of Ontario has shared with us. 
"Why don't you just move?"
\s
all these people saying it's such a shame this place is closing, but none of THEM stepping up, buying the store or franchise to keep it open, always looking to someone else to solve the problem. Trust me, if they company itself thought this was a truly profitable venture, it'd be a corporate store in a heart beat and kept running.
Edit.- it's like the town where I live. The downtown area has a massive population, but no real close grocery stores, just the yuppie market that has crazy prices. Every now and then there are people moaning about there being no grocery store close enough with such a huge market, and the city should do something about it.   
A few years ago, there was an independent grocery store opened up, with comparable prices to Loblaws. It closed down in less than a year, because few people went to it.   
People don't seem to understand, if there is a market for something, and it would turn a profit, there would be a store there for that market. One not being there straight up says that they couldn't turn a profit, or not a high enough one to be worth it.
I grew up near here in a town called Embrun. People can just go to Loblaws (independent) in Embrun or Metro in Casselman.
Laughs in town that is literally an intersection with a corner store and a tavern, is 25 minutes from the next small town which is Cayuga, and 45 minutes to Hamilton. Just to tims is a 25 minute drive; I drive 60km one way to work every morning lmfao. Our "local" Foodland in Cayuga has shtty deals so we go to Calidonia or just suffer and go to Hamilton. The only plus to living where I live is the native Rez is about 25 minutes away, and with a primium car, that saves my ass alot.
This is an example of a typical article meant to pull at your heartstrings rather than tell the facts. Is the grocery store profitable? Why would there be no buyers for a profitable grocery store?
I used to live in a small town and we had s grocery store similar to this one (Foodland not valu-mart). The prices were high and there was definitely cost savings driving 30 minutes to the next bigger city to do a big shop (including the price of gas). Eventually the store closed down.
A 20km drive for groceries is pretty standard for most small rural communities
People need to understand that grocery shop profit margins are actually a joke. I know because i ran one. Unless you are loblaws or walmart you are not gonna be turning any huge profits at all. Factor this in and this makes perfect sense.
I think your council offered a total property tax exemption for any grocery store and you hope you can find someone willing to do it. 
Not much else you can do
Interesting suggestion, maybe the locals could form their own co-op grocer  (not the chain) but in terms of business model.  Locals could buy a membership and run it as a co-operative.  
Thats what a lot of small places used to do...  My guess is rent and/or land value in that area may make any startup difficult.  This is like 20 mins to Ottawa...
my hometown making the big news! Lol
This is why Canada needs immigrants -- they will put in the very long hours to run such a family business.
$1 million and then property can be yours, then you just have to pay the franchise rights
Why would anyone run a business in Canada when they can just long a condo and rent it out... .... ...
I will buy into any story that makes it so I never have to wake up 2 hours early, get ready, drive to work, find parking and drive home exhausted ever again.

We saw it cut emissions across the world last year, air quality increased everywhere, there were dozens of articles about it. It's possible
We don’t talk about this enough. Remote working cuts emissions and also relieves the tax payer of needing to make expensive infrastructure investments to widen roads, add massive public transit capacity for rush hour.
I’m 100% in favour of a remote work from home workforce. It frees us from lengthy commutes, coffee and lunch breaks at home with our significant others, families. We save money and eat healthier meals. We have more time to spend outside work with our children. Working remote went quit well for me and my colleagues. 
Here is my issue though with work from home. If your job can be down remotely. It can also be done remotely anywhere else in the world where labour is cheaper.  Shareholders don’t care if jobs are kept in Canada. They are happy to reap bigger dividends to send office jobs to India, Philippines, Algeria, Morocco where English and French speakers have few rights and are paid poorly. 
If we are to go full stream work from home, to balance our personal & work lives, to save us money, corporations real estate expenses, save the environment. Then we must demand our government to protect Canadian jobs and stop companies from contracting, sub contracting work to vendors, consultants half way around the world. 
It’s a big issue with IT, but any back office job is at risk. Heck medical imaging review is already being done for some US companies but staff in Bangladesh. Our jobs aren’t immune to this and as Canadians we need to stand against corporate greed and government which is tone def to protecting workers rights.
One of the best thing to come out of the Pandemic is the swift death of the modern day office. Downtowns are now useless as one of the major reasons for living downtown for many people was being close to work. 
With the strong rise of telecommuting gone are the days of being shoved on a train an hour a day just to smell some stinky persons BO. No more cattle cars to take us to our black hole cubicles that suck the soul out of every employee. 
Finally, now watch the huge propaganda campaign that's gonna come out of office tower management companies to get us all back in the office. There are some major pensions in Canada that are tied to office towers. 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_Fairview
Let’s be real. The average Canadian does little to add to emissions in Canada. We have one small vehicle, public transit when possible. I’m doing more than my part to save the planet. 
How about corporations or countries like China or militaries like the American military. What’s their carbon footprint?
Here comes programming for climate lockdowns
"might"? It doesn't take a genius to figure out thousands of cars off the road is a good thing.
I've been telling this to everyone.
Fuel companies can't afford for people to think this but less people on the road would save money for everyone else.
Less fuel costs for the individual makes an insane difference. As a country that has to idle their cars for 20 minutes for 6 months we owe it to the planet to keep people working at home.
Cut the population will reduce emissions.
Yeah let’s pretend like Canada cutting emissions will substantially affect global warming at all
I work for a tech company and can say for certain that our productivity takes a massive hit when everyone is working from home. The solution is good city planning with walkable neighborhoods.
Mon professeur à l'université est le chercheur qui a produit l'étude la plus récente (pré-covid, 2018) sur le télétravail. Elle parle du Québec, mais les professeurs ont enseigné aux États-Unis. (George A. Tanguay et Ugo Lachapelle)
 Ils ont découvert que le travail "bi-modale" (semi-remote) n'affectait pas la quantité totale de voyageurs automobiles, mais seulement la répartition du MOMENT de leur voyage pour l'envoyer hors des heures de grand traffic. En fait, dans certaines situations, comme celle des travailleurs autonomes (self-employed), les gens voyageaient encore plus, augmentant de ce fait la masse totale de voyageurs.
Ils ont aussi démontré comment le télétravail affectaient que les femmes perdaient un peu de leur "pouvoir négociatif" pour les salaires et les promotions. Cette perte n'affectait pas les hommes. (Loss of negociating power)
Si les réseaux de transports collectifs était au minimum 2x plus efficace et atteignaient 4-5x plus de villes, la mesure pourrait être beaucoup plus intéressante.
There’s two sides to this.
I bought an air conditioner this summer and at times was running it all day. Had I not been working from home, I would’ve been commuting to an office on public transit and would have run the AC far less.
My carbon footprint is likely higher from working from home compared with commuting. Obviously that’s not going to be the case for everyone but for those of us in dense urban areas with good public transit, the equation is a lot different than for people in smaller, car-dependent cities.
I'm glad that 90% of the Canadian workforce does not work from home.
careful what you wish for. I work tech and i have been working from home. However, the two BIG disadvantages of working from home are :
1. Inefficiency : its much much easier to take breaks anytime you want in your own home than office and there is always the tendency to stretch out 8 hrs at the cubicle into 14 hrs at home, meaning home life quality suffers. 
2. working from home == your boss has the ability to now bug you at 9pm over some work email stuff.  Ie, lot more intrusive, where we cannot leave the office behind once we clock out.
We will cut emissions when Suncor, Imperial Oil and Shell’s northern Alberta upgrading and refining are no longer economically viable.
Can I get a 'Hell yeah!'?
Agree, even hybrid working where you spend a few days every month in a shared work place is also good. Wfh saves you Atleast and hour a day which means more sleep or actually developing a hobby.
They'll be discussing their well deserved Christmas break.
More internet censorship

Sounds like a crock, cause basically Uber eats is really doing nothing. 
Tokyo Smoke already offers Click and Collect  at their participating Ontario retail cannabis locations. This enables you to purchase products online or by phone, pick up your orders at the store.
but either way.
You still have to get up off your ass and go pick it up from the store.. might as well just skip the Uber Eats. be different if uber eats delivered it to
Here in Quebec, we have same-day delivery from the SQDC
Oh boy. Potlucks just got a little more spicy
Don’t toke and drive
Uber Smokes
I wanna talk to Samson!
I have a friend that had a very similar job to this a few years ago, but back then it wasn't considered a corporate venture.
Thanks for this, truly a crock , no home delivery
What a waste of time. If you're going to the store anyway, what is the point of purchasing online?
Alberta cannabis usually delivers within a day or 2 here, but I’ve heard they may be closing that site soon and letting private companies do delivery instead. No idea on the timeline but I’ll be sad.
This deal would moreso be for both company's benefit, as opposed to the customer's benefit .

They've done this in other provinces and municipalities, always ends up with First Past the Post winning, unfortunately.
Be on the lookout for all of the tricks close Harper ally Christy Clark pulled in BC.    
1) Requiring 60% for a change to happen.  
2) Adding multiple options to split the "change" vote.    
3) Never explaining the options.
Jesus they really cant take losing can they? The majority voted not to change not that long ago but here we are.
"...and come up with a better answer than the last 27 assemblies on electoral reform!"
Every party, and by extension supporters of each party, prefers a different system, as they each benefit most under different systems. It's extremely rare for a vote of this nature to result in anything other than more of the same.
But in PEI everyone just takes turns being Premier, don't they?
1/3rd of "all political seats" should be filled with regular citizens.  Drawn from the records for potential jurists.  Even use the same laws.  Except they get the politicians pay and assistants as well.
Might be a good way to engage the citizenry.
Ahh PEI. Best voter representation in Canada
Any politician with the ability to make this change inevitably does because if there truly was accurate representation they'd be out of a well paying job.
Utter conflict of interest in our leadership.
They actually voted in PEI already, and MMP won, but the government said "plebiscites don't count".
There was a previous BC referendum where change won a majority (but failed to clear a required supermajority threshold).
> 1) Requiring 60% for a change to happen.
It was actually 60% of the popular vote *plus* 50% of the ridings (where winning a riding meant winning more than 50% of the vote in that riding).
NDP also offered electoral reform referendum in BC - it lost even more.
What would it take for you folks to believe that people simply don’t want your reform plans? Nobody outside of Reddit wants it.
You could say the same for BC where the majority voted for STV, but the govt decided you need a ‘supermajority’ to change the system
FPTP can not continue.
In PEIs last referendum the liberals kinda Sabatoged the vote from the start. The ironic thing is reform would’ve won the referendum if it was conducted in fptp.
There hasn't yet been a majority vote for yes or no because neither side has reached the required 60% threshold.
There was an online plebiscite in 2016 where 52.4 voted in favor of mixed member and 42.8 voted for FPTP. But low voter turn out meant neither side met the 60% threshold.
In 2019, a narrow majority voted against MMP, but again neither side met the 60% majority threshold - 52% for FPTP and 48% for MMP.
There is enough support for MMP that lead to this citizen's assembly. The PEI government hasn't yet given the discussion a fair shot
Every PEI party except the Liberals (they chose to abstain do to conflict of interest) openly supported MMP on the ballet last election.
> Every party, and by extension supporters of each party, prefers a different system
Many of the federal Liberal MPs support an electoral system that would likely hurt their party's seat count.  It's just the one guy at the top...

If you feel that strongly against the uni's policy for a vaccine then go to another school or take classes online at this school or another school.
>As of Friday, “28 students (of a total of about 37,000) have been placed on involuntary leave due to non-compliance,” Western said in a statement to Global News.
he's done this before. He never had his books out in the first video, he was there to just make a scene.
I sleep well at night knowing these self-centered delusional morons are being excluded. Central to their worldview is that we don't owe each other anything, that you should be able to act without regard to the well-being of your fellow citizens. 
Maybe they've read too much Ayn Rand, or maybe their minds never advanced past adolescence, but they are an obstacle to ending the pandemic and should be dealt with harshly. Expelling this student was the right decision. He doesn't deserve to sit at the grown-ups table. 
The student made his choices, and those choices have consequences. I hope it serves as an example to other regressives that we're sick of their bullshit.
I guess this is choosing a life as a grifter and propagandist as opposed to getting an engineering degree.
Holy shit that guy comes across as the worst kind of entitled asshole.
What a dumb shit. Lots of uni courses require a whole list of vaccinations to even be a part of. You can get this one vaccine or be removed like students from other courses would
Good.
‘I don’t feel it’s necessary’ is pretty solid ground to chuck your academic career over. Twat.
He says his expulsion extends to all Ontario universities for the next five years. 
So long after us vaccinated folk have resumed something resembling normal life, he’ll still be feeling the consequences of his choice. Hope it was worth it (it wasn’t).
What a fucking clown. I wouldn't want that guy engineering sweet fuck all after seeing what a moron he is
What a baby.
what a waste of time interviewing this clown
Entitled piece of shit.
"Everyone fell silent". That's a shame. /s
Learning a valid life lesson he is. Not everything is worth a fight to push your opponent into a corner. There's a line in the sand in many arguments that you shouldn't cross. He jumped over the line, what, 5 times? If he's going to fight his expulsion maybe he could have put his time and effort into fighting the covid rules instead? He acted like an ass now he can flip burgers or head on over to Walmart or Tim's. They're looking for people. 
And hey, here's another thought. You're free to return to your homeland (England by the sounds of his accent) at anytime you wish if you feel the rules in this country are too burdensome for you to align yourself with. There are too many good people who want to come here and we need all we can get to further the growth of multiculturalism in this country. We don't need dicks like this.
I bet this guy is a regular poster in this sub, along with conspiracy and a few other right wing culture warrior subs.
How do people like this get into university?
Lol student "activists" are idiots. I recall some from undergrad and grad school. As far as I know, none of them are doing well. They are all stuck in crappy jobs, life going nowhere, and all that fire for their "cause" completely extinguished.

Beavers are one of the most important animals to the development and health of the ecosystem.
https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/why-beavers-matter-1.4121550
What are they doing and why is the NYT's launching what feels like the beginning of one of their drumming up war campaigns, but against beavers?
Don't touch my Beaver 🦫! It's amazing!
"For a long time, it was believed that beaver ponds increased the temperature of water in the ecosystem due to its greater surface area absorbing more energy from the sun. That was always thought as a possible way that beaver ponds could be damaging the surrounding ecosystem.
This assumption has been overturned by new [research](http://isemp.org/projects/beaver-restoration/)."
So a specific hypothesis from a single study about a single metric means that beavers are not harmful at all to the environment? This is the problem with citing news articles that are written for the average folk. It does nothing to actually get into the nuance of the situation and makes overarching conclusions about a very specific question that was asked.
People forget that  in nature everything is there for a reason as soon as money comes into the picture.

Funny that you should say that. Canadian Pacific Railway had a logo with the beaver atop a coat of arms or shield of some kind. After all the expense incurred from flooded railway tracks over the years, they finally nixed the little guy from their branding. Google CP Rail logo under the images tab.

That will happen when you have a healthcare system that is running at capacity during good times.
Our national approach to public health care is to sacrifice the healthiest in the hopes of mitigating the deterioration of the least healthy.
[removed]
Great, the media and governments scared the population shitless in believing Covid was the only thing we need to worry about, and parents were too scared to take their kids to doctors (or doctors were too scared to see patients in person).
went to the ER in late dec 2020 and they found a brain tumor, surgery was early january 2021. people (including myself) always have excuses not to go see a doctor.
(quick edit.. it actually began with a phone appt to a walmart clinic and he told me to go to the ER ASAP.)
If there's something covid has shown is that our healthcare in this country is truly a joke. Yeah, it's free and doesn't cost citizens anything but what does that really mean when an extra 200-300 people IN A PROVINCE in ERs causes it to get overloaded. I love having socialized healthcare but it definitely has weaknesses.
I also dislike having it be under province's purviews, it really should be federally controlled. If it was federally controlled, maybe we could have had a singular response to covid rather than each province doing their own thing.
This is not as much about wait times for individual visits as it is about diagnostics, bias and limitations of virtual care, leading to longer diagnostic times
> Singh says she believes the delays in diagnosis have been caused by patients staying away from hospitals because:

Having gone through the 2-3 week diagnosis process recently, I absolutely agree with this doctor. 
- there are no more “walk ins” with covid, which drastically extends time for each visit
- since tumours take multiple assessments and appointments, what could be done in a matter of days or a week with walk-ins can take multiple weeks 
- you can’t squeeze in another appointment on a Friday so that you get results by a Monday - you’re waiting until you can get into a lab on Tuesday and then getting results on a Friday and repeat 
- you are directed to virtual care first, but they are not equipped to assess the gravity of the situation as well as in person due to limitations (video and audio, lighting) compared to in person 
- you’re brushed off because “it could be covid, you should get tested” or “you’re young and healthy, let us know if it doesn’t go away in a week” instead of - let’s do some proactive tests ASAP to ensure it’s nothing else.

Time to de prioritize the unvaccinated.
It's a good thing we weren't stupid enough to fire unvaccinated doctors during such times.

Manitoba government is doing nothing to bolster healthcare whatsoever. They have swapped premiers 3 times in 6 months. So they're doing nothing, and it feels like our local government is a suit and tie with no face.
They are taking this as a business opportunity to launch a booming private healthcare sector for the financially privy. Our crap government is trying to let socialized healthcare die so they can take in taxes and profits instead. A real right wing agenda.
Wages have been frozen in healthcare for two conservative terms now and people are quitting like crazy. Absolute corporatist assholes running our province into the ground for money and I can't even picture a face to assign blame to.
So they're actively crippling our healthcare system and screaming that publicly funded system doesn't work.
National? Healthcare is a provincial matter.
Yup, the more clear the secondary effects of lockdown become, the happier I become with my choice to cut Covid fearmongers out of my life, get vaccinated and aggressively push for everything to come back in person and people who are vulnerable to protect themselves. This, plus the men's mental health crisis, plus the child abuse crisis and what has happened to education makes it pretty obvious we made the WORST choice imaginable and must act to reverse it as much as we can.
Lockdowns were a part of the delay but *they* were relatively short-lived and temporary.
>We have chosen to prioritize ... the health the expense of everyone else
We've chosen to prioritize the unvaccinated who show up in the ERs needing intervention and weeks in care.
Nobody was locked down from seeing their doctor. The article states it is, in part, fear of Covid19 that kept people from visiting their doctor. That fear is valid especially in a world where so many ignored simple steps to reduce Covid19.
This isn't the fault of government action it is the fault of government inaction.
Except this is not a result of lockdowns or other restrictions. 
Nice persecution complex though.
Honey, healthcare systems were overwhelmed because we had to divert resources to treating the unvaccinated swarming ICUs. As many have told you here, no provinces lockdown protocol prevented people from seeking medical care.
But go on, clearly your confirmation bias helps you sleep at night.
This right here.

This isn’t about them being religious, it’s about them being missionaries.
Christian missionaries have an extensive history of fucking shit up in third world countries.
To be more specific, it is well known that Christian Aid Ministries employees have been involved in child sexual abuse in Haiti. It’s no wonder why Haitians aren’t happy with their presence there.
I feel bad for the kids involved in this cult, both the North American kids of missionaries and the Haitian kids being “helped” by them.

What a vile comment
This is the tolerant left I've been hearing about I guess.
Is it untrue?
I know, just think, gangs like this would target them as well.
Robots and automation is happening anyways. 
If it can be automated it is being automated
Lol "wage inflation", cost of living above the poverty line has been well above minimum wage in any province for a long time now.
There has barely been any wage inflation because of immigration. Just cost of living inflation.
Here in Calgary any able bodied male  could walk onto a dozen construction site  and be working at $23 an hour before days end..with almost unlimited overtime. Hard work but a decent pay and learning skills.  Robots  aren’t framing a house even though the power tools are great labour saving devices.
A phenomenon I’m seeing with immigrant workers. In the oilpatch Filipinos, Colombians, etc that have been here a few years have now rising to supervisory positions.  They are now hiring more Filipinos etc on their crews.  The principal language now spoken at some of our well sites is Tagalog.  Excellent, dependable guys.
Anyways, lots of jobs and not enough bodies. My take on it is automation and robotics will be as much  about labour shortages as  costs.
Wage... Inflation? Are these people fucking stupid?
If Mr. Levitt was smart he'd be signing deals with those robots to represent them in court
To be fair, Robots won't be dragging employers up before Hurt Feelings Tribunals
Article Summary:
* In Canada, more than 800,000 jobs were unfilled as of June.
* Employees are seeking “different” jobs that offer remote work and higher pay.  There is also a residual impact of the Canada Recovery Benefit and Employment Insurance, which caused employees to prefer not to work.
* This pressure is being seen in increases to minimum wages in several provinces,  including recently, in Ontario.
* But the law of unintended consequences always prevails.   As technology improves and its costs reduce, the sales of robotic products meant to replace employees has been skyrocketing.
* **The cost of labour and robotics are moving in different directions. Increasingly, employers will be looking to replace increasingly costly labour with increasingly cheaper robotics.**
* And as robots are not paid wages, benefits, payroll taxes and are indifferent to union and human resources issues, they are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in Canadian workplaces.
"Unintended"
"The impact of this disequilibrium has been a strong pressure on wages" this is a quote from Starbucks, bucha fancy words for "I refuse to pay a living wage"
It’s best for everyone that low skill min wage jobs be completely eliminated, paving the way for universal basic income
Bring on UBI!
>If it can be automated it is being automated
Absolutely - There's very little that can't be automated.
The real trick is finding useful, valuable work for those displaced. It's going to get harder and harder.
MMmm.... they're not going to automate something they can get at rock bottom cost in the first place.  *Can* automate and *will* automate are differentiated by what it will gain by doing so.
Yeah, robots do break down on occasion, but the reliability is generally much higher than a human so if it's practical to automate, it'll happen.
Some classes of work are just hard to automate at the moment.
> If it can be automated it is being automated
When you think about it, with enough development and advances in tech, a robot or AI will be able to do just about anything a human can do.  AI lawyers, robot surgeons, robot police and soldiers, AI management of companies, AI call centres...
Because of immigration? There is no evidence of that. Jobs are still going unfilled. 
Inflation has been caused by the government printing money and handing it out by the billions.
>Robots  aren’t framing a house
Robots aren't framing a house *yet*
There's a labor shortage because everyone that was laid off over the last 6 years doesn't want to go back to an industry where there is no stability.
I've gotten a few calls over the last couple of years. Am I going to move to Alberta for a job that can disappear overnight on the whim of oil prices? No chance in hell.
Oh boy unlimited overtime! It’s just like heaven on earth.
Let’s just ditch Resumes altogether and just submit applications through TikTok? What a joke, writing a resume is pretty damn easy, and someone who finds that to be too complicated should probably not be working in the financial industry.
It's a bank. Exactly how useful of an employee are you to a bank if you can't even write a resume?
It's never been easier to be a big banker!
It’s not like they were reading them anyway
LOL.  Good luck with that.
Do applicants get participation medals if they don't land the job? 
You know to help with hurt feelings.
I’m going to copy my comment from the last post about this:
The hardest part of getting hired anywhere is getting your resume seen by a real person. Pretty much every company uses ATS software that ranks resumes based on keywords. It’s not a good way to do hiring for new grad and internship positions because you aren’t expecting those hires to know anything when they start. The new process will probably be identical except for the first step where it will rank applications on traits like problem-solving, adaptability, etc instead of keywords in a resume.
For example, if you’re hiring for an internship aimed at 2nd year students and get the following 2 applicants:
1.	Goes to U of T business, doesn’t have to work while in school so they’re treasurer of a couple clubs
2.	Goes to U of S business, has been working part-time at McDonald’s to pay for their degree.
Applicant 1’s resume would hit a ton more keywords for a job in banking because of their treasurer roles and location. Applicant 2’s resume would never actually get looked at even though they might be a significantly better worker. Both will be equally clueless when they get hired and won’t contribute anything meaningful during their 4-8 month term. It’s just a way for managers to identify hard-workers that they’d like to have on their team.
Video resumes, you have to audition for the jobs.
all the info you submit is already in several databases you don't know about.
you generally don't get cold call offers until you start submitting keywords on jib applications that get cross references.
they will probably be great at selling high fee mutual funds with a straight face. ALSO NO BITCOIN WE BAN YOUR ACCOUNT ILLEGAL!
It depends whether the primary goal of the hiring is productivity or demographic virtue signaling. 
If the latter, it's actually a good thing if unqualified candidates are too unmotivated to even write a resume: they will probably also be too unmotivated to make much of a mess once they are hired.
Unmotivated incompetent employees are much less trouble than motivated incompetent employees.
Frontline customer service reps!
Applicant number 3 will get it because their dad plays golf with the hiring manager.
What do you do? I work at one of the Big4 and basically none of what you said is accurate
I was once asked to record a 5 minute video as part of an application process by a recruiter. I told the guy I didn’t want the job badly enough to bring myself to that level.
This is such a prole mindset, thinking that they will even need to submit an application.
I did consulting and now I’m in software engineering. 
I can guarantee you that all of the Big4 companies use ATS’s to rank applicants. Deloitte even advertises services to implement applicant tracking systems for clients. 
The hiring process is pretty much the same in professional services as it is in every other industry. It’s pretty unique in how it treats new hires though. Professional services employees are the companies product, so there’s a huge push to over-advertise their new grads knowledge and productivity in order to get them billing asap. That doesn’t really exist in any other field and it’s generally expected that it’ll take you 6 months to start catching on at your first job. Most new grads are losing their employers money for the first 12-24 months.
They do have to apply so HR can issue the offer letter.
I do recruiting and resume review at Deloitte. There isn’t any ATS used to rank applicants. 
I highly doubt most new grads at Deloitte lose their company money. Considering they are billed to the clients between 180-300 an hour in the first 12-24 months and make about 15 an hour after OT is accounted for.
I'm sure their attorney handles this all for them.

This makes me sick
Looking forward to a dramatic drop in covid cases.
Lol.
Where can we book an appointment?
Always a month behind the states. 🙄
we wont see that until the general population gets a 3rd shot.
Wait for your province to announce when they are getting supplies and how to book appointments.
Ontario starts tomorrow (Tuesday) morning at 8.  Through the same portal adults used.  
Or call your pharmacy and/or your health unit to see what's available to you.
Check your government's health department website.
Are you trying to be smart while being dumb?
Huh? And then the fourth and the fifth too?
Wait.. what? Then why even give it to children if it won't affect cases?
People under 12 are 25% of cases
[removed]
just speaking for Ontario since thats where I am, case numbers dropped 96% within 3 months of the general population (18+) getting fully vaccinated.
not sure why it would be different when people get the 3rd dose.
the poster I responded to said dramatic drop. unless the vast majority of cases are in children I dont know why you would expect a dramatic drop.
For Ontario, [they post online](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/en/data-and-analysis/infectious-disease/covid-19-data-surveillance/covid-19-data-tool?tab=ageSex) a breakdown of cases by age for the last 2 weeks of cases. 
Ages 5 to 11 don't make up the majority of cases but they currently have the highest rate among any age group. It's at a rate of twice as high as most age groups.
So yeah, I don't expect to see a dramatic drop but certainly will help.
for sure, it will help.
I am not really a marvel fan (I don’t hate it but I find the movies more or less the same so don’t make a point to watch them), but this dude seems like a good ambassador from Canada on the world stage.
SNL is trash
One of the better weekend updates in a while.
I don't watch SNL because it's more miss than hit, but a couple of the clips in this article are good.
I'm glad there is more Asian male representation in the media.
I love Shang Chi, amazing movie I give it 10/10 😍😍😍 I love all Marvel movies, very entertaining !!
Amazing that they got that  'bottom' dig in the skit with Bowen.
like the actor Simu, but disney isn't trying hard enough to make a good movie when an asian actor is the lead, legend of Shang Chi was boring
I have no feelings negative or positive towards the Simu Liu guy, but I can totally pass on anything to do with SNL, Marvel/Disney, or the CBC.
The movies follow a formula
Weekend update was only good when they had Norm
When’s the last time Disney made any good movie that wasn’t a cartoon? 
The company is just formulaic mass entertainment. The movies are made by accountants, not artists.
I liked it but im easy to please
> Shang Chi was boring
To be fair, the last several Marvel movies have been boring.
It's no different than any other Marvel movie, so it's totally equal in that way. Like I know that Marvel movie protagonists are mostly white dudes, but the movies are all produced in the same way. It's not like Shang Chi is one of those direct to DVD Disney sequels.
Kim's Convenience > MCU
Yep. I swear it’s down to the timings of arcs and everything. The only movie that felt different in recent years was The Eternals.
That is truth.
If kims convenience was so good it wouldn’t have been canceled.
That's now how tv shows work. 
Some of the best shows in history are regularly cancelled. 
Marketing > writing/ quality. 
Same with all products really. Superior products fail all of the time on a million more factors than their pure merits.

Maybe don't encourage your journalists to defy court injunctions.  If that's part of the job, you're a terrible partner/employer.
It's been the same thing in Canada for decades, and no one ever wises up!
1.  Big, expensive project begins somewhere near your reservation - or land you can vaguely call your homeland.
2.  You protest and blockade the project, and all the environmentalists jump onboard, because they think this is about saving the environment.
3.  You make life hell for the project owners and cost them hundreds of millions of dollars.
4.  The project owners eventually give-in and pay you off to the tune of many millions of dollars.
5.  The money doesn't go to the reservation, but gets siphoned off by the 'elected chiefs'.
6.  Everyone involved (except the chiefs) loses untold millions (sometimes billions) of dollars.
7.  The project never gets stopped.
8.  The environment ends up worse off than if there was no protest.
9.  All the money gets embezzled and none of it goes to help anyone.
10.  There's a new project nearby - BACK TO #1!!!
And, the entire time, you have to listen to people on Reddit supporting and up-voting the extortion!
I got a great laugh for all the wrong reasons.

So you are a journalist imbedded with them when they are breaking the law and the cops run a raid you are going to get arrested and they should understand that risk going in. Will they be charged with anything highly unlikely. Being "press" does not mean you are automatically removed from being able to be arrested and especially in cases like this
Land defenders just need to pretend they're anti vaxxers and the RCMP will pack up
No problems here. Chiefs have given the go ahead and have disapproved of the remaining protesting.
> Award-winning photojournalist
Who cares?  Why does the author keep ranting about it as if she's the Queen?
If she was somewhere where she shouldn't be, or obstructing, too bad not sad.
That's what you do when people break the law... you arrest them...
You guys complain about vaccine enforcement yet you continue to defend cops who do worse enforcement. Plain hypocrisy
Good, get these fools out of there so we can get back to work.
Good. Stop holding people hostage for doing their jobs when your leaders already approved of the work.
Good
I don't even care about the details here, we have seen this way too many times. If these protesters are in the way, get them *out of* the way and continue work. Anytime a big project happens in Canada it always gets blackmailed for cash by every group under the sun.
We already paid too many groups to keep dealing with new guys popping up everytime we make progress. Get off the land or you will be moved off the land. Enough of the niceties, let's get going here
Too many replies and my head hurts can someone post a tl;dr sticky as there seems to be a wish wash on this topic and missing info
Thanks
Dont block things.
Of course she’s working for the narwhal hence refusing to leave structures knowing that she’d be arrested
For sure arrest everyone that's breaking the law... media can view from a distance without obstructing the police... you do realize that all the first nations involved have agreed to this pipeline and have told the government that the people protesting have no legal recourse to use traditional laws??
Fucking disgusting pigs
Parents and children life-long learning is the way to go
Hahaha education reform focusing on children. Will never happen. Here in NS the Liberals did "education reform" as a way to end school boards so that the government had more top down control and so they could remove parents from decision making. To think they would do something like this for the children is laughable.
Child care is going to end poverty?  Everything in this country is getting WAY more expensive for this to even make an impact. I work in a skilled trade and I have so little buying power I could puke.
In Manitoba they're literally putting the parents in charge. 
Now that the PCs have a female Premier, they better make sure Wab doesn't cross the floor and start throwing her around.
childcare definitely won’t end poverty but it will help. You know “put one foot in front of the other.”.
> In Manitoba they're literally putting the parents in charge.
This is the dumbest thing said today. I'm here to tell you if you kill school boards parents lose a voice. I'm from a province who did that and parents have to start Facebook groups and protest the government to even have a say. No parent feels they have a voice anymore. This is about centralizing decisions and killing local voices. Convince me otherwise
Yeah exactly. Endless footwork while people are figuratively walking on gangrenous stubs.
Yeah well, our opposition has been useless since 2015 and I've pretty much stopped giving a shit about any of the daily goings on at this point.
TL; DR:
A Five Guys in downtown is offering $15 an hour plus a bonus to flip burgers. Not to be outdone, a McDonald’s in Blainville is offering $17.50 plus a signing bonus for lineworkers on the night shift.
So when Au Pied de Cochon – about as famous a high-end restaurant as exists in Montreal – advertised a position as a cook starting at $13.50 an hour, the reaction on social media was severe.
It’s pretty simple supply and demand for businesses and employees. If people won’t apply/work for that wage offer more or don’t get employees and go out of business.  Potential employees can work there or not based on pay, benefits and opportunities.  Not sure why all these have to be in the news.
Are restaurants and service industry jobs aware they CAN pay more than minimum wage?  Like, has anyone explained to them that minimum wage isn't the actual wage they HAVE TO pay, but they can actually CHOOSE to pay more?  
I found out the other day that a grocery store worker near me has worked at the same job for 13 years and the only time she gets a raise is when the government mandates it.   
Now, we can talk shit about America all day long, but grocery store workers there typically get raises... I've met people working at Kroger making 45k/year after 10 years.    When I worked at Taco Bell in Michigan as a teenager, I got a .50 cent raise/hr after my first year there.   
There is no reason a business should have to be MANDATED into providing employees with normal raises over time.
What is a gourmet plateau?
Maybe I will just cook at home.  The rich will always do their thing
They are going to have 100 good applicants anyway because people will take massive pay cuts for the status. Think of what people will do to become models over doing toilet paper sales.
...but it looks good on your resume... type bullshit
Well if it’s that bad people won’t apply? And if people don’t apply then the owner will raise the wage.
[deleted]
Sad to see APC not offer hire wages. I love to eat there, and pay a pretty penny to do it, but if there staff isn’t being compensated for the amazing work they do I’m not sure I can continue going there so enthusiastically. This is something I’ve had to grapple with quite frequently lately.
A fancy vegan cafe i frequent posted multiple minimum wage jobs the other day. I DM’d and said i won’t be supporting them anymore, then they replied and said minimum wage was “standard”. I don’t want to buy things from a business the employees can’t afford to shop in.
>“And that means five years from now we're going to have an extreme shortage of chefs.”
No, you'll have an extreme shortage of chefs *willing to work for peanuts.*
Welcome to socialist society,  where everyone gets to weigh in on a companies business
This is a sign of the times, most middle class can't afford to eat at nice restaurants even on special occasions anymore, and if they can they won't want to pay premium for the commie bs experience so stay home.
Used to be you started on dishes at a buck or two over minimum and lended a hand doing prep when you were busy or short-handed. Alot of great chefs got started that way.
Sorry, fine dining industry just like travel and tourism is doomed as we knew it.
Food quality at Au Pied de Cochon went downhill because they pay shitty wages.
You eat shit and earn crap pay to be able to put that experience on your resume. Lots of industries play that game.
Sure pal nobody is even going to apply for those “starting wages”
All of us Liberal voters are thankful JT is bringing in 400,000 future Liberal voters to work in the restaurants we go to with our friends to wax eloquently on the state of inequity in Canada and the world.
If you can't afford to pay your employees a proper living wage, you can't afford your business.
The tip out to the kitchen staff could be huge... No one knows that side of it. Im sure they do 4% tip out or something like that to the kitchen.

It’s almost as if the anti-vaxxers were just saying they were waiting to get the hard to get vaccine hoping it wouldn’t come.
Does the Johnson and Johnson vaccine have a No More Tears guarantee?
J&J the company that knew they had asbestos in their baby formula?
1,190 people still got it.
J&J should still be available for anyone who wants it. Or needs - I'm thinking of the people who can't get the mRNA stuff (proethylene glycol allergy, for example).
Called their bluff.
Because nothing Anti-Vaxxers say is about the truth. It's about making themselves feel special by being rebels. Even if its killing them.
Well the J&J vaccine would be 2-5% effective right now if you got that last spring. Couldn’t that be an issue?
I know someone who used the "I want the J&J" one and now that it's here, they are just like "no i don't want it, i'll wait until march when the vaccine passports lift for ontario". 
:/ 
So yeah... it was always a lie and they are anti vax the entire time and I fucking called it.
Don't want a vaccine that only lasts for six months? How about one that only lasts for two???
Or they have absolutely no idea this is an option, it isn’t exactly publicized.
J&J has more negative side effects so that could be why.
Goal post moving is a tradition in the antivax community. It’s always that X needs to happen before they will get the shot and when X happens, then that’s completely forgotten.
I mean the same could be said for Pfizer if we are going to start on big pharma
Along with many other companies.
That's the tragedy in all this. J&J gets all the flack because they're massive. And the rest skate by with their reps intact and pocketbooks unharmed.
But many companies were using tainted talc powder over the years since its pretty easy to miss it in the processing (they're mined in the same place afterall)
> in their baby formula?
You meant to say baby powder.
What the fuck, you don't trust science?
Or they claim they are waiting for the Canadian made vaccine.
Now they're holding out for the Russian one.
I’m so pissed that Doug Ford told them he’s going to lift the mandate. Absolutely no incentive for anyone to get the vaccine now.

Alternatively "Edmontonians march in opposition to the democratically-elected chiefs who support Coastal GasLink project"
And what about the majority of the Wet’suwet’en? Who support the project?
Left wing protestors demanding royalty be upheld….LOL.
>*"More than 100....?"*
Well more than 30 for sure.
Alternate headline:
>Some Edmontonians exited their **gas-heated homes** and drove in their **gas-powered vehicles** to a protest where they wore **winter clothes made of petroleum products** in order to demonstrate their own ignorance and hypocrisy.
What is their preferred method to ship oil?
So sick of First Nations protests.
Democracy is a colonial legacy that constitutes racism.
/s
If you believe the Indian Act is democracy sure. But it definitely isn't. Band councils are a creation of colonialism. The herititary system is not.
Candy
Nobody else can protest like the FN. Every other group is a joke, but when FN get together people are like “oh shit”.
Dave Chappell got it super wrong in The Closer, if he wanted to study a successful tribe making gains in policy, following the gays instead of the FN is foolish. 
No other group has been able to gain so much ground against government anywhere.
Pretty much what another user just unironically replied.
Watching the Green movement endorse feudalism gets me so hard.
Irrelevant, 1 group of leaders is answerable to their members and consulted with everyone openly.
The other group of leaders is answerable to themselves and booted 2 leaders for supporting the project.
Not surprised, sadly.
In a certain other Canadian sub that it the only acceptable opinion. Any other opinion is grounds for a ban.
>Watching the Green movement endorse feudalism gets me so hard.
And the patriarchy. Ignore the woman they elected, this man had his power bestowed on him by his fathers sperm, and his fathers sperm before him.
Their elected leader is a woman. I wonder how many people I can unironically convince that a woman being in elected office is a colonial construct?
That other sub is a little special sometimes.
I got banned last week for saying that COVID isn't really all that dangerous to children but that getting them vaccinated should still help slow spread somewhat.
Don't really think that deserves a permanent ban but here we are.
I suspect that if the roles were reversed, and it was the hereditary leaders supporting the pipeline and the elected leaders opposing it, their views on democracy would be very different. I'd bet that if the elected leaders were opposing it they'd be backing them instead.
Why wait?
It’s about time! Why the fuck were they exempt in the first place?
Thought this was already the case?
The key paragraph:
>The mandatory vaccine rules, which come into effect Jan. 15, would affect few if any unvaccinated NBA and NHL players, as the percentage of unvaccinated players in those leagues is negligible
Maybe this was part of the original agreement. it gave the NBA and NHL time to get the "stuff" in order.  I'm actually really surprised at that statement. Maybe the NBA is trying to show up the NFL now. If yes, then this actually ends up being really smart marketing, especially what happened to QAaron Rodgers.
Why wait until Jan 15?
You mean they could come right now? Wtf.
Home court advantage !!
Why not just require a negative test? If the spread of the virus is what this is really about, surely that would be a reasonable policy, no?
Meanwhile the fully vaccinated Ottawa Senators are all benched for covid.
Yea! Let’s segregate all unvaccinated people until this *endemic* blows over! /s
We have little kids being prevented from playing ice hockey, a Canadian tradition, because their mom and dad didn’t want to take a vaccine. We have teachers and students bullying kids who won’t wear masks and pressuring them in classes. They’re being called stupid, losing their friends, feeling depressed and traumatized.
And so much more division.
This is crazy. When will this stop? The virus is obviously not going away.
Sorry Kyrie no more 6 for u
Didn't I hear mandates might be withdrawn January 17 or something of the sort?
It isn't already closed?  Why has Tyler Bertuzzi not played in Canada then?
kyrie not even playing anyways
Why are we getting new restrictions? Shouldn't covid be over by now? Most of us got the vaccine, at a certain point you just have to open up and let the dice roll.
Just close border to all unvaccinated.
Why did this take so long? One rule for the rich and one for the rest of us?
Sucks to be them.
Canadian Basketball Association soon, I presume.
Hahahahahahahahahaha
Not a fan. This national program is going to be another huge drain on the governments coffers when this amount of money should be spent on any number of other areas that need money more such as infrastructure, education or health care
how about trudeau offer a fair deal instead of treating Ontarians as lower class citizens then those out east. we have the highest cost and he offers the least money
He will likely sign the deal when the feds offer an actual decent one instead of expecting the province to pay for Trudeaus election promises.
Wow this would be incredibly useful when it comes to incentivizing people to have kids so this generation of workers actually replaces itself since our immigration is so strict right now.
This doesn't help the 30% of the population that doesn't have a 9-5, Monday to Friday job.
It's ridiculous to push this through.
Why didn’t the Wynn liberals develop child care when they were in power for 15 years?
waiting for the election Id think
It’s coming…
The issue is, who’s going to work in those sectors if no one can afford decent child care? Child care is education also. Infrastructure=ensuring our country’s population can maintain itself while building a future. People don’t want kids now because it’s too expensive, what future are we building if we are failing people in the first years of their lives? There are THOUSANDS of people in the province who could work if they could afford child care. The amount of money being funneled into Ontario Works would surely drop if people had less obstacles to obtain employment. If more people work, less people living on assistance.
How much you want to bet that the contracts are awarded to their donors thus putting small and independent businesses out of work.
>since our immigration is so strict right now.
I mean, we're planning to take in over 400k per year. How many do you think we need to take in? There's a practical limit: infrastructure, jobs and resources have to keep up with the influx, right?
Especially considering that they're disproportionately made up of the low or moderate income earners the program is supposedly targeted at.
There wasn't a significant federal funding component being offered at the time and so most provinces and territories never created their own system. Québec levied their higher tax rate in order to create a provincial childcare subsidy in the 90s.
They started: [https://globalnews.ca/news/4111767/premier-wynnes-daycare-announcement-a-winner-with-some-kingston-parents/](https://globalnews.ca/news/4111767/premier-wynnes-daycare-announcement-a-winner-with-some-kingston-parents/)
They did. The media is just pretending Ontario does not already have subsidized child care. It is just mostly being offered to single parents though. 
My mother used to work at a daycare before she retired this month and she said that 75% of the kids that were there were subsidized.
This is just unsubstantiated conjecture. Currently Canada has 18 month parental leave and kindergarten that starts at 5 in most provinces. That is essentially leaving a total of 3.5 years where full time child care must be paid for. Its also important to note that a national childcare program is inequitable. It will only be useful from people who are working standard shifts of 9-5. It also will not be 10 dollars a day. there will be an income slider as per the Quebec model with significant wait lists. It will balloon in cost like most government programs. To establish a program that only serves a proportion of parents for such a short period of time is only being pursued because of political points. A more equitable program would to increase the child benefit then parents can choose how to spend the additional money. If a parent chooses to stay at home with their children until they go to school, they are losing out on the national program but NOT if there is an increase to the child benefit. 
TLDR: program is inequitable, costs are being misrepresented and there are better options.
I should have said our immigration has been stricter since covid.
https://bipt.ca/immigration-wont-replace-canadas-aging-workforce/
There's been a huge hiccup in the countries population. Childcare incentive is incredibly specific when it comes to actually helping working class families. It does nothing to strengthen buying power for the parents. It certainly makes it so a stay at home mom can now work. Which is incredibly useful if your country operates as a corporation.
Right wing governments don't even budge unless it benefits their investors somehow. Consider this corporate progress, rather than for the benefit of actual humans.
No? Raising taxes and hydro and we’re still in massive debt with nothing to show for it.
When my son was in daycare last year, our government subsidy took the costs from $1200 a month to $350. And with covid we were not refunded any costs for time we had to keep him home for testing/waiting for results. I was missing work and still having to pay for childcare. 350 a month is not bad at all, but when you then lose $800 of income for the month and they still want a full fee for not even watching your kid. I can imagine what the costs were like for people who didn’t qualify for such subsidies.
Just a note the 18 months of parental leave is not truly a real option unless you can already afford to not work in the first place, the 18 month option gives you smaller payments that equal the same as if you were only to take twelve months.
That headline haha. Why is it relevant questioning if you can order weed via uber in the states?
You now can get your dope and munchies all at once......lol
Wasted opportunity. Should have named the service DooberEats. 2 birds stoned at once.
Does uber eats deliver booze?
We can't, most delivery licenses are given to social equity and economic empowerment applicants and they are given a 3 year monopoly on delivery in those states. No Uber or Lyft delivering weed in the USA for at least 3 to 5 years.
Sure but this has nothing to do with r/canada.
How is damming a flood plain and diverting a river related to emissions.  Global warming is coming because of contributions from all nations.  Not just ours.
**If the weather is nice and there are no extreme events:**  
"Climate and weather aren't the same thing.  You can't draw any conclusions in the short term; you have to look at the long term trends instead."  
**If there's an extreme weather event:**  
"See?  Climate change is real.  I told you!"
Let’s convene at one of David Suzuki’s sprawling mansions to discuss.
Even if Canada's greenhouse emissions were to go to zero tomorrow the climate change outcome is going to be the same. Yes we should attempt to curb emissions but we shouldn't destroy the economy put all the eggs in one basket. We should be really preparing ourselves in the near future for the inevitable next natural disaster.
Abbotsford BC was built in a lake that was pumped out that required pumps running 24/7 to keep the water out of the town. The Town was warned in several studies prior to this year that the dikes would fail if there was a flood. Nothing was done, everyone is just sitting around blaming climate change. It is the inaction of politicians in preparing for this that is the problem. It's a once in a 100 year flood that hadn't  happened in like 160 years.
I can cut our emissions by 25% in 5 seconds...
Stop counting our exports as canadian emissions.  Done.
   There's no reason why the exported coal China burns and the exported natural gas and fuel America burns should get counted against canada.
They burn it, it's their problem to fix, unless we can impose restrictions on how they use it.
We're a fucking punching bag to the world, it's sad.
Anyone who links a single weather event to climate change is not an expert.
I'd love them to find a photo of some people out for a walk on a beautiful day.
canada will be producing more green house gas emissions in 2050 than they are now
Bogus.
https://sp-images-pddataservices-com.cdn.ampproject.org/ii/F2/sp.images.pddataservices.com/sp6images/vasn/11481634/2015-10-30-22-41-15?quality=90&strip=all&w=400
I guess their gas at almost 2 dollars a liter is too cheap maybe the gov should hike it to 5 dollars a liter so no one can aford to drive then they wont have anymore cars.
Raise the Carbon Tax by 10,000%
That'll take care of all those India & China emissions
Not going to happen.
When disaster strikes, it’s our fault.
When the weather is beautiful, it’s a global problem.
It’s propaganda . A population of 37.5 million Canadians is not altering the global climate. And floods have been happening since the first civilizations in history.
Historic flood events all over the province, not just in Abbotsford. After a summer of heat that broke national records. Also the longest period without rain in the lower mainland ever. And the 3rd worst forest fire season of all time. 
One of these things is a once-in-a-century freak event. All of them happening in the same year indicates that something fundamental has changed. 
And it all compounds. Months without rain, and huge forest loss due to fires = loose soil. Loose soil = mud slides and floods. 
It's only gonna get worse! As to Canada's contribution, of course we're not alone but we're #1 in GHG emissions per capita. And growing at the fastest rate in the G7. We can and should do better.
This is a strawman. No one is saying to just look at the weather on any given day. We *are* looking at long term trends. 
The trends are that BC has been getting warmer every year. Forest fires are trending worse every year. Summers are getting drier. We've had not one but **four** major weather events this year (national-record-breaking heat in June, record stretch without rain in July, record cold temperatures in October, historic flooding in November). You want to look at trends, sure let's look at trends.
Careful he might bomb you
Sure, everybody passing the buck is a great way to accomplish anything..
We could not sell coal to China.
Then by that same logic we should be responsible for the emissions in other countries made by industries used to produce goods that get exported to Canada.
This will go nowhere, what have we learned whathappened in the shooting in nova scotia other then the shooting of a fire station was justified
I don’t understand why the subject officers notes are not accessible to the investigation.   I understand his right to remain silent, but his notes are not private or privileged. 
There’s a lot of stink on this whole tragedy.
Scenario: Toronto Police got a tip that this guy was selling illegal guns and set up a raid, but fucked up the raid and now he's dead. Toronto Police investigate further and it turns out the tip was bullshit and the guy wasn't selling illegal guns at all.
Biding for time until they can come up with a reasonable explanation for why they sent a death squad?
My hot take on this incident.
They *should* interview the officer.
Source: Self bequeathed law degree, PhD Bird Law from Yale (graduated sumo cam louder)
This story needs to be top of the subreddit every time it comes up. Something stinks like shit here - the TPS executing a daytime search warrant outside of its jurisdiction while not informing authorities in charge. If something needs to come of anything, it's this
The TPS carried out a no knock raid 150km outside of their jurisdiction without notifying the local OPP. That detail alone stinks to high heaven.
Kinda like how they never asked which cop fired the gun that murdered an infant child in his father's truck? 
Typical.
With Trudeau and fascist Bill Blair's gun confiscation coming up in 4 months without a buyback solution..... I expect more death squad fuckery.
> Toronto police said officers arrived at Kotanko's home on Port Ryerse Road around noon, some in plain clothes and some in tactical gear, on Nov. 3, looking for guns.
> Kotanko was inside his gunsmithing workshop and family and friends say the 70-year-old was shot when police approached.
Genuinely curious what dumbass reason a judge or JotP had for issuing a warrant to raid a 70 yo gunsmith for guns.
Canada's police force has become a scary joke and I ain't laughing
Lol what? Siu has not invoked mandate? They love invoking it even when police barely have any contact with people.. But this they won't? Lol
Edit : apparently SIU did invoke mandate... Just super quiet atm
[SIU's inevitable "finding"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NNOrp_83RU)
They executed a search warrant on a gunsmith at his place of work? If you had any brains you'd wait to intercept him away from the weapon depot he has and limit your subjects access to weapons. Guys job is to handle firearms.. good chance he'd have one in his possession during the raid. 
Without extreme exigent circumstances this plan was incredibly stupid. Sounds like they could have surrounded the building and had his OPP buddies talk him through a safe surrender.
Gosh, it's amazing that the 'back the blue' and 'if you just comply with commands you wont be hurt' folks seem to have missed this thread.
This raid should have never fucking happened.
State sponsored hit. Fucking murderers.
The cop that killed the guy doesn't have to release his notes. What kind of American crap in Canada is this?
No. Good. Cops.
Classical SIU diligence.
Another day of government wasted trying to divide the population. Just in case you were starting to not hate anybody.
Headline reads like Trudeau is about to turn into Greg Abbott or Ron DeSantis and start banning vaccines and mandates lol. 
I'm not sure if I agree that Trudeau has those protestors fresh on his mind. I think it's just free win legislation, some low hanging fruit to make it look like he's workin hard. On the provincial level it's been pretty popular. 
I'm also not sure if the anti-vaxers are motivating the fight against "online abuse". The liberals seemed to have their minds set on that type of legislation before the anti-vaxers come out of their holes. They just make easy pickings for reasons the internet can be a dangerous place.
There were protests that blocked hospitals. If you value life over stupidity, it's abundantly clear there need to be laws to protect vital institutions like hospitals.
Paywalled
Welcome to communist Canada
Justin Trudeau only really snapped once during the protests that followed him throughout the last election campaign.
“Isn’t there a hospital you should be going to bother right now?” Trudeau shot back at a protester who was shouting slurs against the prime minister’s wife during a stop in Surrey, B.C.
Not surprisingly then, one of the top items on the government’s to-do list in the coming weeks will be a legislated crackdown on protests against hospitals and health-care workers.
It is a sign that those ugly protests of the campaign did in fact leave a mark on Trudeau and his government, which is finally getting down to business in Parliament this week with the official speech from the throne to be read on Tuesday.
All the attention about the anti-vaccination movement in this country is currently focused on the trouble plaguing Conservatives. It was a drumbeat under all the activity of MPs returning to the Commons on Monday: who was vaccinated in the Conservative caucus and who was not?
But during the campaign, anti-vaxxers were a problem for Trudeau as well, and the coming weeks will reveal how much of the government’s agenda was shaped by what Liberals saw on the election trail this year.
While the throne speech is not expected to contain many surprises — it’s reportedly being kept fairly short, too — it is really the first chance for Trudeau and his Liberals to say what they learned about the country while they were out seeking re-election.
On that score, the protests were a nasty surprise — a glimpse of an angry, frustrated slice of the population that was looking for someone to blame for all the disruption in their lives. Day after day, the shouting mobs showed up to vent their anger over everything from vaccinations to lockdowns to Trudeau himself.
Initially, Trudeau sought to understand the protesters, and to cast them as victims of the damage the pandemic had wrought in many Canadians’ lives. But by the time he got to Surrey, the prime minister saw them as a slap in the face to peace, order and good government. They were the kind of people who got in the way of doctors and science.
So if the protests do make an appearance between the lines of Tuesday’s speech from the throne, it will probably come in the realm of law and order.
The measures taken to protect hospital and health-care workers will be one such appearance. Another will be in a promise to tackle online hate speech and disinformation.
The federal Liberals already were making moves to curb hate speech before the election campaign, but the protests underlined just how quickly disinformation could spread and become dangerous. So too were all the election signs defaced during the campaign, many of them scrawled with racist or xenophobic slurs.
Demonstrators at the anti-Trudeau protests shouted slogans imported directly from disinformation channels online, rife with conspiracy theories on vaccines and the government.
If nothing else, this should have put some iron in the Liberal government’s spine when it comes to stronger measures against online abuse.
The Liberals’ platform identified this as one of the priorities for the first 100 days after the election — legislation to combat “serious forms of harmful online content,” as well as strengthening the Criminal Code and Canadian Human Rights Act against hate speech. They also promised a “national action plan” to combat hate by 2022, which is only six weeks away.
A couple of weeks ago, Trudeau spoke to the Paris Peace Forum about the spread of online disinformation and hate, in what might have been a hint about where Canada is headed to combat them.
“There is no doubt the digital space has incredible power for good,” Trudeau said. “But from disinformation on vaccines to online extremism, we’ve also seen the threat it can pose to our democratic values, systems and our citizens. We can’t allow the benefits of the digital space to come at the expense of people’s rights or safety.”
Unfortunately — or fittingly — Trudeau never did get to finish talking about the “real action” Canada was taking. His online connection to the forum abruptly cut out, never to be restored, right after the prime minister mentioned the importance of connectivity.
Many Liberals are no doubt tempted to see the ugly election protests of 2021 as a distant memory, better forgotten or relegated to the tiny slice of the population who voted for the People’s Party of Canada, which failed to win even one seat in the Commons.
But even if they don’t get a direct mention in Tuesday’s relatively brief speech from the throne, they will echo through whatever moves the government makes in the next weeks to contain the forces that drove those demonstrations.
Damn. Where were you when the government was shutting down all those medical procedures resulting in an insurmountable backlog of illness and death?
Social distancing and wearing a mask because there was a dangerous pandemic going on. Which hospital did you blockade?

Housing? Affordability? Inflation? 
What planet does our government live on?
None of this is as important as housing. Seriously, GET ON IT.
>The Liberals plan to push ahead with bills on conversion therapy, an extension of some COVID-19 benefits, a bill to protect health care workers from harassment and providing 10-days paid sick leave for workers.  
>  
>Holland said the party wants to have bills on all four issues through the House of Commons before a recess scheduled for Dec. 17.
\-------------------
*How are these the top priorities for the nation?*
nobody gives a crap about this
please deal with the actual problems
And they're gonna hope none of us notice the record number of Canadians killed by China's fentanyl terrorism program this year. Maybe if enough Americans also die over the next year something will be done to combat China killing our kids.
Covid benefits should be augmented and reserved for p/t workers before the unemployed, especially if full time job growth capped out in q3 of this year.
Trudeau wants quick wins, not hard work.
They live on a planet where the CBC endlessly debates the moral failings of the Conservative party amongst three Liberal political operatives while a Liberal host moderates...I believe they call it the "At Issue" panel.
So is there benefit in taking risks by addressing real issues or does it make sense to tackle divisive issues that make your competition look bad through easily digestible headlines?
Continuing to dole out billions in Covid benefits to the underemployed at a time when we're dealing with both a huge labour shortage AND runaway inflation is fucking ass-backwards.
> What planet does our government live on?
The same one as over 10,000,000 Canadians who voted for the status quo Liberal-PC one-party lie last election.
Planet? I always thought it was an alternate dimension. Same planet, different dimension. The one where feelings override facts.
Yea could we not get one of those four to actually be something pressing/ important. Just shows how little our priorities and theirs line up.
10 paid sick days? Feels good being in a federally regulated industry
>China's fentanyl terrorism program this year.
Could you expand on this?
I know of China's infamous policy regarding the sale of drugs (Illegal to sell to Chinese Citizen, un-enforced but 'technically' illegal to sell to anyone else), is that what you're referring to here? Or is it something else?
Temporary ban on foreign property purchases would be a quick win. And he even campaigned on it (after stealing it from the CPC). 
Also, what’s happening with child care?
Andrew Coyne is a Liberal operative?
> They live on a planet where the CBC endlessly debates the moral failings of the Conservative party amongst three Liberal political operatives while a Liberal host moderates...I believe they call it the "At Issue" panel.
So it's all the CBC's fault eh? I do love how Conservatives are never to blame, even when it's their own policies driving people away from them.
I agree with all these policies, it’s just not where people’s heads are right now. Everyone I know is screaming bloody murder over inflation, affordability and the fact that a home is a million dollars. Pretty soon someone who’s working full time won’t be able to eat. Sure we need paid sick days. But we need the foundation to be steady more.
> Just shows how little our priorities and theirs line up.
Maybe if we voted for the guys who can't even get their vaccinations done it'd be better?
Wait till they find out that people kill themselves every day over debt and all the bell let’s talk days in the world won’t fix that.
Ugh. This story again. She is being taken advantage of by a charlatan. She is a victim, but not of what and whom she thinks she is. The real villain is the naturopath who is taking all her money and selling her lies.
BC has a pharmacare system which is free for disability benefit recipients. So why are there not covered for Madeline?
> Desperate for solutions, she eventually found a **naturopath** who took her seriously, and they found that a **mix of intravenous vitamins** helped her get some of her energy back. The injections give her a couple hours per day when she’s able to be active, what she calls her “energy envelope.”
> But because these are naturopathic treatments, and she’s needed more advanced ones over time, the costs have added up and now work out to **over $100,000 per year**.
I cannot help but think she is being taken advantage of by a pseudo-doctor who is taking all her money and giving her placebo in return. And now the pseudo-doctor has convinced her the best course of action is for her to die when she doesn't have any more money to pay them.

When only one option is available, it's not really called choosing.
Not to take away from the idea as it is one that needs to be addressed but in this case her treatment is 100k a year from a naturopath , so no amount of boosting PWD is going to cover that.
I’m making the same choice and I’m not even disabled. Just poor.
Only an idiot would write “choosing” to die here. Forced- the government  literally forcing people to die because there is zero accommodation and zero effort to improve access to resources.  Government would rather have people kill themselves than actually do what they are supposed to and advocate for help, programs, and expansion of services. The cons and libs show little indication of this changing. 
Every politician should live homeless and or handicapped for atleast a year to be granted a seat.  We make volunteering a high school requirement for graduation but let any pig to the trough in parliament.
>Because if our approach to disability support is neither economically nor medically logical, then we’re deliberately torturing and punishing people with disabilities for no other reason than we can 
Could there be a profit motive? Also, I've noticed that while healthcare is funded by the federal and provincial governments, and oversight is done by the local health authorities, all the 3 entities ever do is point fingers at each other when something Canada-wide needs fixing.
I got kidney failure at 40 due to an autoimmune disease that popped up when I got pneumonia. Starting dialysis and chemo was really hard and I had the discussion with my Doctor about assisted dying. I told him I would think it over. Having a minor son at the time was the reason I procrastinated about MAID. Turns out that my kidneys improve and I was able to be off for all of 2020, after 7 months of being back on dialysis I'm down to 1 treatment per week and hoping to be off again by Christmas. The Doctors didn't tell me this was a possibility with having kidney failure resulting from an autoimmune disease. I'm sure glad I didn't pull the plug on myself. Even with being on dialysis, life is worth living. I can't afford much. My Christmas tree broke last year and there's no money for a new one, sheets have holes in them because there's no money for new ones. I recently lost 50 lbs and there's no money for new clothes that fit. I don't care about that stuff. Everyday I'm alive that I can go for long walks with my dog are the best days ever. I'll eat one meal a day because that's all I can afford. I enjoy the little things in life and I'd rather be here instead of dying.
Every human society that wants to call itself human should provide care to people who are physically unable to earn enough money to support themselves.
The total value of the TSX is over $3 trillion dollars right now. Canada has the money to do this. If we want to call ourselves human, we should fix this problem.
boosting this! everyone should know about this injustice!
It's too bad our governments top priority right now is to censor the people and not focus on what everyone wanted during the election.
We've went from killing the disabled as being an ethical hazard to facilitating people who "choose" to die as if this wasn't part of the endgame in the first place.
Choices can be influenced. Societal pressures to kill yourself, either direct or indirect, are making certain "choices" easier and more popular.
Least hysterical /r/Canada comments section.
i barely make ends meet while working full time, i cannot even imagine what people with disability might go through. Canadaland did a podcast recently covering the same topic, it is so sad to hear defeat in their voice, i would not wish this fate on my worst enemy.
I doubt if this girl will be approved for MAID.  It sounds like she's refusing the aid and treatment of modern medicine and being treated by snake oil salesmen selling her pseudoscientific nonsense.
No doctor who wants to keep his license would help this girl, since she meets only one of the 3 requirements and even that one is flimsy.
If there really was a labor shortage, employers would accommodate disabled people and employ them. Thereafter, disabled people would earn more from these jobs than from government assistance.
As someone who is disabled.. I will work until I can't.
When my money is gone, I will be too.
Disability in my Province is 587/month.
I know I'm fucked. I live in a van. 4 weeks ago I fell and broke my ribs.
This forced me to sit in the driver's seat of my van constantly because of the pain.
Fast forward to today and I'm in the hospital because a massive skin infection.
The day I injured myself I was going to go get a job. I had enough savings to last a month so I could work without worrying about money.
Well that money is all gone now, and I have about 500 dollars worth of bills coming due by the end of the month.
If I'm REALLY lucky, I will get 200 dollars from welfare at the end of the month maybe. And I won't be in physical enough shape to actually do any type of work for another two weeks.
So yeah, I'm as fucked as everybody else is.
This country is so fucked and so lost.

Ha. Gov weed delivered by Uber when there are already great delivery services. Hard pass
How much is a gram going to cost you? Like $30 lol?
> Uber Eats will list cannabis retailer Tokyo Smoke on its marketplace on Monday, following which customers can place orders from the Uber Eats app and then pick it up at their nearest Tokyo Smoke store, the spokesperson said.
This is NOT FOR DELIVERY. What a fucking waste of a service. Eat dicks, Uber.
Why? It already gets delivered by traditional mail so quickly.
To combat the illegal market? LoL
Idk if this is new, but in Quebec I seen an advertisement that Uber/Uber eats will start delivering grocery store orders.
I can already do so on TS's website, what new service are they offering here? I'm confused.
1hr where I am
The new service of paying more for the same thing!

Why is this news?
Why does anyone care about naming ppl that test positive for Covid?
>Richards didn't say when Lehoux was diagnosed, but the Conservatives wrapped up a two-day in-person caucus retreat on Thursday.
I wonder how many unvaxxed Conservative MPs are going to be getting sick now.
🦀🦀🦀🦀
Because people who only read headlines will assume he was unvaccinated.
Because CTV can't just have tits as their thumbnail like you can on YouTube.
Covid-19 has been major clickbait for CTV for 2 years now. They get paid to do this.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMSYmcJiOQI&t=10s
> Lehoux's diagnosis should serve as a reminder of the importance of physical distancing and mask-wearing.
At his age, he should be getting a booster as well.
Because it’s a conservative and he is *supposed* to be anti vax, duh!
/s
Because these people are duly elected officials?
from the article  
>  Lehoux is fully vaccinated against the virus  
you might also ask how many 'fully vaccinated' MPs are going to be getting sick now.
Could be a problem if the House becomes a COVID outbreak site.
[removed]
Given that this guy hasn't made much effort to publicly throw himself on a cross regarding his vaccination status I don't know if there'll be much of that
Many haven’t been offered it yet. My grandma got hers (92) but parents in late 60s haven’t yet.
A 3rd dose is not available for people his age in Québec.
Only people who are over 75 or immunosuppressed are eligible.

What are you? A doctor?
I am a little curious that there isn't a full fledged investigation into what appears to be fraud.
I really do appreciate what our federal broadcasting entity is willing to do to expose the underside of these types of groups
What a cult like douche-fest WE is.
These brothers are frauds.
[deleted]
Wow. These Friends of We people are so out of touch.
It’s sounds like WE Charity was some sort finance and clout buying scheme for the wealthy. 
Buying up real estate, free vacations for the wealthy, selective paid speaking engagements, and phantom schools.
Clearly there were a lot of red flags that need a full investigation as to where the donations go.
Alot of commending comments to cbc for this. I think we should remember it was Canadaland that exposed this and was ridiculed by the likes of cbc.
That WE cult sure took a lot from the Scientology handbook.
>The term Fair Game is used to describe policies and practices carried out by the Church of Scientology towards people and groups it perceives as its enemies. Founder of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard, established the policy in the 1950s, in response to criticism both from within and outside his organization. Individuals or groups who are "Fair Game" are judged to be a threat to the Church and, according to the policy, can be punished and harassed using any and all means possible
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Game_(Scientology)
how to launder money through "charity" 101 vibes here.
>Our team also asked many of these donors to share with us their donation agreements with WE so we could see what was promised in return for their money.  None did.
It seems odd none of these donors wanted to prove CBC wrong.
All this is making me wonder if WE was a front for something more nefarious from the start. They were kids when this all started and adults had to be pulling the strings for at least the first few years. It's not like these folks would have just went away when they became adults.
Holy fucking cult. I guess it makes sense the Trudeau family is so close to these scumbags. It's a shame Justin is still in power after almost giving them a billion dollars.
Don’t forget to report all the WE Charity ads blasting on YouTube and Facebook that tries to paint the Kielburgers as innocents.
I just watched the new episode about WE (there was another one a while ago) on YouTube. Honestly, these brothers disgust me. Good job The Fifth Estate for exposing this seemingly fraudulent operation.
This is the best work I’ve seen from CBC in a long time
Corruption is rampant in Kenya, at all levels, throughout government and much of civil society. Anyone who has spent any time there is aware of this reality. Government officials are deeply corrupt. It is no surprise to me at all that WE is also corrupt.
Is Bardish Chagger on the WE payroll now?
I can really see why Trudeaus and We were so close
If anyone’s looking to find out exactly how charitable WE is I highly recommend Canadaland’s the White Saviours podcast.
"To understand the flood crisis currently gripping the Sumas Prairie area in eastern Abbotsford, you have to understand the history of the area, and the roles played by the Nooksack River and what was once Sumas Lake. You need to know why Barrowtown Pump Station exists. And you need to know why, if it fails (and maybe even if it doesn’t), the lake will return."
It was a drained lake that flooded because the infrastructure failed. Also they diverted a major river from that area.
"A 2013 report from the City of Abbotsford claimed that if the Barrowtown pump station were to fail, it would “significantly impact food producers and food processing companies, and cause job losses which typically takes 5-10 years to recover.” "
It's not climate change that caused the flooding. The land was altered drastically by settlers. The city saw it coming well in advance.
Building on farm land doesn't help either
Good thing there are no extensive studies on the likely impacts of climate change on agriculture in Canada showing that we are one of the fortunate countries that will more or less break even.
Here's an alarmist fact-free article instead.
Imagine building a farm in the bottom of a drained lake then when it finally floods blaming climate change 🤣🤣😂 wonder if the next big earthquake on the coast will be blamed on climate change too
Look man, until we're personally the ones going hungry, we're not going to care.
That's how all of response to climate change has gone.
The only thing that's going to move the needle is personal harm on a large scale affecting hundreds of millions of people.
We're just not there yet and this event won't make a whit of difference.
Massive global catastrophe that kills off a few tens of millions of people in a couple of months might do it, but short of that? Eh, we don't care and can't be bothered.
It's the human way.
The flooded area was a lake... And most foods are imported anyway
Every major weather or environment event now is going to be attributed to climate change regardless of facts, just like how every crime or anything is now attributed to race.
Every disasterous climatic event has never occurred before humans starting pumping CO2 into the atmosphere.
Building on [a flood plain left from draining a lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumas_Prairie) doesn't help either.
> Building on farm land doesn't help either
The article (even just the headline) says that this is a shadow of the trials to come for farms in our climate crisis. And you say that building farms on farm land is somehow a contributing factor. Even more troubling, you have more upvotes than downvotes. I'm left wondering where you and your audience think farms should be built, if not on farm land.
If you actually read the article, it says in big bold letters that Abbotsford is Canada's most economically productive farming community. In the interview with Lenore Newman, who has a research chair in food security and the environment at UFV, she says, "It's also excellent soil — you can grow anything there...." The only way to keep farmers from building on that rich soil is if the area is permanently inundated.
Canada's job is to keep the land prepped for the rest of the world to come and take in the next decade or so
we won't break even, where'd you see that?
"Sure millions of people might die, infrastructure across the globe might be destroyed and hundreds of thousands of species will go extinct but we might break even at the end of it so it's not actually a problem".
That's interesting. No arguments from me but could you post a link? Thanks in advance.
Snow in the prairies is being blamed on climate change too 🤣🤣
> Imagine building a farm in the bottom of a drained lake then when it finally floods blaming climate change .....
and blaming Government inaction.
Most of our food is grown domestically. 70% of our food is domestic: 
https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/16-201-x/2009000/part-partie1-eng.htm
Also climate change will also effect our trade partners we export from, like America.
The level-headed commentary regarding specific weather events will go something like this:
No one event can be blamed specifically on climate change, because climate isn't the same weather. Climate change as we understand it is what makes extreme events more likely. When we see multiple strong events creating a trend, that trend is indicative of climate change.
The point about the altered nature of the Sumas flats  is perfectly valid, but it doesn't negate the significance of this weather event and climate change overall. Multiple things can be true at the same time, ie shitty planning can coexist with extreme weather events.
Seems egregious that we allowed this to occur.  BC should allow this land to be returned to it's natural state of a freshwater lake.
After all, Water is Life.
>Canada's job is to keep the land prepped for the rest of the world to come and take in the next decade or so
We're all land defenders now.
> These accolades come for his groundbreaking invention of photonic crystals, which allow light waves to be slowed down, contained and microscopically controlled.
These are the people who should be making sports star wages. This is the stuff that moves humanity forward to new heights.
“Now Mr. John, we need you to trap light in the form of a blade.”
>Canada's most prestigious science prize
The Tim Horton's Cup?
If he patents his invention he can make just as much as sports stars
No...  The Chevrolet Good Deeds Cup
If I recall from reading an article last week, the prize comes with $1M to fund further research, so not too shabby for an egghead that's prolly making a decent  living already, and now a bit of a superstar in the academic/ scientific world.  I'm guessing he's not feeling too bitter about star athletes' level of compensation atm.
Only if it works at scale, many things work in a lab but fail when taken out of the controlled environment.
Like cancer or Alzheimer's cures.
Money is one thing, but nobody idolizes these kinds of people.  Nike won't be offering any endorsements.  They're reserved for knee benders.
Had me till “knee benders”… yikes
"Knee benders"?
Colin K I believe is being referenced. Or anyone who is okay with “bending the knee” for social justice while accepting massive endorsements from a company that willfully dodges taxes and employs child and slave labour.

“Journalist” who was blocking access to the hostages front and centre with the rest of the terrorists.
Charge her.
She chose her side got arrested and now has to face any potential consequences.
One of the things that throw me is our default assumption they were acting as media, and were not actively engaged in the domestic terrorism. 
We know they embedded themselves, not for unbiased coverage; so it becomes how much of a free pass should their nominal press credentials grant them, if it turns out they were involved.
No wonder the Liberals and NDP are pushing for censoring the internet. 
Maybe Canada shouldn’t vote for Trudeau who’s family could probably cast on Succession. 
This country is becoming a joke.
Anyone who cares about press freedom and the state of democracy in Canada should be concerned about this.
Edit: love all the downvotes without comments. You chickens all pretend to be Canadian patriots but you support the fascist tactics of the people. You don’t really believe in democracy it seems.
She's a photojournalist which the article mentions, which her Linked said since 2008.
Why are you trying so hard to hate her? Last time I checked a photojournalist is still a journalist. Also, where does she claim she's FN?
Edit: Ya, delete your BS comment.
She’ll be let go ASAP. There is no basis whatsoever to charge her
Yup. Post submitted for visibility(of stupidity).
No. She was a reporter. She will get released.
Last I checked, press passes were not conditional on what kind of editorial slant the coverage has.
(Also there was no domestic terrorism that happened)
Let’s see if the police have any evidence they were doing anything other than observing and reporting. It’s our default assumption because that’s what reporters do.
Yes, we can't be blinded by loyalism to the nation. We have to criticize where it's due, and if you look beyond jingoistic statements about our country, this scene is no different than what happens under fascist regimes. Why are the RCMP being militarized and deployed against journalists? Why are they being used as corporate security?
Yes. What the actual fuck is going on? Look at the thumbnail and tell me what country that is.
Our government isnt even hiding that it's turning into a corporatocracy.
How do we know that?  
Its important not to minimize that this isnt a “pipeline” protest.  They trapped Canadian citizens via destruction of infrastructure in a dangerous situation.  
If she was involved and active in the behavior very much there will be reason to charge her.
It’s on video that she was a participant in the hostage blockade, not acting as an impartial journalist.
Were you there?
They are conditional on them being actually engaged in press activities.  Not actively engaged in illegal acts. 
The domestic terrorism isn’t to be sensational.  They have a political aim. They targeted a group of citizens of same nationality.  They used violence to intimidate. They even semi took hostages.  
It doesnt have to result in death to fit.  Im not pro pipeline, but that doesn’t blind me to what this was.
She’s already been released. It was an illegal arrest
What video? What was she doing ?
It's amazing how fast we went from "there is no inflation" to this.
I’m convinced that’s why they called the election early. They knew everyone was getting fucked and wanted to secure power before everything went to shit
I wouldn’t anticipate any politician really caring about inflation. They are elite. Their donators are elite. It’s the regular folk that feel this pain. 
This country has gone to absolute dog shit
They only care about inflation now because it’s being coupled with wage inflation for the first time in 30 year.  Housing, education and energy skyrocketed exponentially over the last 3 decades and no one gave a shit but now we’re having to pay people more and inflation is suddenly the single greatest economic issue of our time.  Virtually all of it is caused by Covid related international supply chain problems.  It’ll sort itself out in 24 months don’t let them trick you into believing paying people more is causing this.
Yes, it is time to get worried. Or perhaps act on something. Everything is skyrocking, housing has doubled and in some cases trippled and so has rent. This trend can't continue...
>  “We are a very long way from the 1970s,” Bailey scoffed, highlighting the differences to an era when inflation hit 24.2 per cent in 1975.
Here is the part that pisses me off the most. When the so called experts at the head of these institutions say this but ignore the fact core inflation measures have changed like a dozen times since then and are not apples to apples. Back then they didnt so heavily discount food, rent, houses, or energy like they do today. We dont know the actual comparison, but at least be honest about that.
Central banks all unanimously said this is transitory back in January. Well, its proving not. Our handlers are fucking it up at the steering wheel. And we know they are going to blame consumers, supply chains, and raise taxes instead of end the gravy train for their buddies.
It is a big issue, the government and the NDP who backs them don't care for some reason. They seem to think internet censorship and dress codes are more important issues.
I don't think most Canadians understand what is about to happen.  Central Banks are trapped.  With countries debt so high they can't raise rates but if they don't inflation will run wild.  
They won't be able to afford to pay their obligations if they raise rates without printing money.  
That's a feedback loop.  They won't abandon the boomers, they WILL print the money.  Inflation WILL run wild for quite a few years
Grew up with inflation in Yugoslavia, not a fun ride watching your parents being able to buy less and less while working more and more… 
All I can say buy foreign currency that isn’t inflating or actual gold and keep at home and then convert back into local currency as need arises, to somewhat protect your purchasing power.
Amazing how inflation has been eating purchasing power forever and this is framed like it's something new.  Did no one see their grocery bills double in the mid-late 2000s? It was those oil prices,  remember? Did prices go down when energy prices fell? Lol 
Most wages haven't kept up with productivity or inflation for decades.
Nahh...no big deal. Should be over in a few days if you listen to Tiff. Buy Buy Buy!!!
It very much is an issue in particular for low and fixed income folks. So many groups in those brackets.
A low and fixed income person has to pay the same for potatoes and meats as a millionaire.
A low and fixed income person does not have any funds left to hide their  money in offshore account.
Yes, this is when you blindly follow Keynesian economics. 
Truth be told, I had professors in university who told me "inflation is non-important" and that "full employment" is all that matters. 
Yeah, have fun rationalizing that now with some lived experience you dimwits.
I've been reading the novel "Eighty Six" recently which is basically a scathing critique of modern democracy. And it's absolutely crazy how many parallels to the events of that story I can draw to what I'm reading in these comments. The Eighty Six are an analogy for taking the easiest, most irresponsible short term solution possible and the legion represents all of the societal woes we pretend to have solved years ago. 
>The fact that it can't reach a decision until the situation has already become critical is modern democracy's greatest weakness. 
Inflation needed to be taken seriously half a century ago, but everyone wanted to take the easy way out, so we now pay the price. We're fucked. 
>B-but the number of legion we've observed has definitely been decreasing! They've already been reduced to half of what they were a few years ago--"
"Inflation has definitely been 2%, the data shows it"
>To the extent of what you can observe, correct? 
Completely disregarding that the effects of inflation in a keynesian system act more like a dam bursting all at once than a faucet filling a sink. The cracks do not manifest on your price tags until it all collapses.
Stagnation is the worry, that will trigger a crash. Keep eyes on unemployment, that rises then you should worry
No party gives a shit about the Canadian people.
Never believe a liberal about money
I seem to remember another Trudeau contributing to the same problem during his tenure, at least this one waves with five fingers instead of one. Small victories
If I didn't make as much money as I do, I'd be royally fucked right now.  I can't imagine how it must be light for a family in Ontario to bring in less than 160k a year.
Thank you to everyone who wanted free money and thought Trudeau and his side kick jagmeet could do no wrong.

Surely these were stolen from Canadian legal owners... /s
Well, obviously this calls for a further ban on hunting rifles obtained legally.
Journalists: “look at all of these AR-15s!”
Better keep her locked up until her trial. Definite flight risk. 
Tax dollars I don't mind spending on scumbags.
I’d be more impressed if they could tell us this was the only shipment that was sent.  For all we know they could be doing 10 of these shipments per day at each crossing.
And where are the others?  It was just one lady?  BS.
Gee, imagine how much more smuggling could be stopped if we weren't about to spend a couple billion to confiscate guns from hunters and target shooters?
Just as importantly, imagine how much black-market demand would be reduced if we spent the money on infrastructure, education, and social programs?
So for this one bust, how many such shipments have made it through, into the hands of thugs?
I wonder how they'll spin this to blame LFO's.
Ask JT if these guns are being bought with our tax money.
All serial numbers surely traced back to long gun rifle owners in western Canada with valid RPAL’s right? We need tougher handgun laws…
“The agency said a vehicle was sent to secondary examination at the bridge in Point Edward, where its **alleged border officers** found the undeclared, prohibited handguns, 13 over-capacity magazines, 43 10-round pistol magazines and 100 rounds of ammunition inside boxes in the trunk of the car.”
I hate this journalistic practice of using ‘alleged’ when referring to something that actually happened (especially the weird usage in this article; is there some sort of doubt that it was border officers that found the guns or something?). 
An allegation is an assertion to be proven in court. Cops found a shit-ton of handguns in someone’s car that was smuggling them across the border. That’s a **fact**. The importation/possession charges are an **allegation**.
This is how all of Canadian criminals get their guns pretty much although everyone knows that already, and people will continue to take the risk to get paid transporting them
Every one of them a polymer gun.. Time to ban 3d printers and resins. /s
Make examples of every criminal that tries this crap, internationally and domestically.
Link to the article is broken for me.
I am glad to see meaningful police work happening.
why is this thread just cringey gun nuts crying about our new strict gun laws. no one should have the right to own a gun. the less in the country the better
time to ban handguns in Canada this is out of control. JT /s
They can’t do that, it violates my right to bear doomsday devices.

“The 2015 study by government of B.C. consultants assessed a sample of 75 Lower Mainland dikes and found that 71 per cent were vulnerable to failure by overtopping, where floodwaters go over top of the dike and wash it away, during either a major Fraser River or coastal flood.
The report rated the highest elevation of the key Sumas Lake reclamation dike in Abbotsford as “unacceptable,” the lowest possible in the survey. “Overtopping is expected during Nooksack River overflow,” said the report.
And that is exactly what happened this week.
The report noted the height of the dike at the Cole Road crossing was 60 centimetres below the design for a major flood. The dike collapsed at that spot this week.”
“As early as 2003, the task force had warned that a one-in-200-year flood would put Highway 1 underwater for nine days and flood 1,160 primarily farm properties with a conservative estimate of $130-million damage.
An updated 2020 consultant’s report carried out for the City of Abbotsford found that damage from a major flood could be as high as $960 million.”
“Postmedia has learned that the province has carried out an updated risk assessment of the more than 200 regulated dikes in B.C., with a total length exceeding 1,100 kilometres. It was completed in February 2021.”
After a few Google searches, I've found nearly annual news stories citing studies and reports warning of flooding in Abbotsford. One said that the 1990 flood was likely every 35 years, so we're just a few years early.
I think the only thing unexpected is that most floods are due to spring runoff from heavy snowfalls. So the heavy rain (all at once) in November is unusual.
One problem is that unless the US does something about the Nooksack, there's not much more Canada can do, other than build bigger dikes.
BC's Hurricane Katrina. Experts warned for years about the deficiencies in critical infrastructure, but they ignored by authorities until those very systems failed like predicted.
This will happen more and more as infrastructure that's been neglected through low-tax policies over the last 40 years is challenged more and more by climate change induced extreme weather.
There was a study done in 2019 that recommended that Highway 1 through Abbotsford and Chilliwack should be elevated so something like this could be avoided. The cost was around 2 to 3 billion dollars. The Provincal government and the cites of Abbotsford and Chilliwack said no because it would cost too much according to them and now this happend.
its almost as if they should have made the flood prevention dams proposed in the 1970's
&#x200B;
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moran\_Dam  
https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0106105  
this dam, and a series of others, were proposed in response to floods in 1948 as flood control protection. The dam network would have produced significant power and protect the lower mainland from flooding. This did not occur over protests related to the salmon fishery.  
The cost is what you now have. And you didn't do all that great protecting salmon either.  
Now surely an intermediate level dam was available as an option, power production with minimized impacts. flood control, power, salmon could all be accomplished.  
diversion from the colombia is the most valuable aspect of this. you get hydro off the columbia flow, higher shuswap water levels for fishing and boating, control lower water temps and flow for fish, increased bargaining on the columbia river treaty/water rates to washington (and california).
They drained a 3 meter deep lake in 1920 and built homes and farms. They did not fill the lake bed with rocks and earth they installed a pump instead. The dry lake bed is just sitting there patiently waiting for a dyke or a pump to fail. It is hard to view this in a way that makes sense.
Governments love to pay for studies. They also love to not do anything based on those studies. I'd bet something like 80% of our government's time is spent on meetings, studies, and reports that produce no action or real world impact. It's a self sustaining bureaucracy that keeps a bunch of people busy.
The truly shocking thing about this is that they describe the cost of fixing and upgrading the dikes to have been prohibitive.  
How prohibitive? Between 29 and 340 million dollars.  
This government splashes around $200 million grants to UN projects like it's nothing yet we can't afford that?!  
When I was a kid I remember vividly being on a tour during a vacation in New Orleans where the tour guide was joking about how the project to upgrade their levees was a fiasco due to rampant corruption. She was joking about it saying that it was a cultural thing about Louisiana, saying that they feel that it's better to have politicians that steal than ones that will try to change things because whenever they try to make changes, they'll inevitably screw it up.  
We all know how that turned out for New Orleans once Katrina hit yet this situation is somehow worse because there was no attempt to perform badly needed upgrades, no matter how much could be skimmed from the project because it was politically advantageous if they failed.  
In some ways I respect the New Orleans ethos because at least corruption encouraged them to embark on new projects while our politicians are motivated to let the infrastructure fail because it justifies increased taxation for the purpose of "stopping climate change."  
But at the end of the day, it's all just useless politicians being completely negligent and their constituents paying the price.
The entire area is a lakebed only kept dry by massive pumps running 24/7. 
While a tragedy, it certainly shouldn’t be a surprise.
I wonder if Abbotsford being hobbled by insider nepotism plays a part in the lack of response - ie the elected mayor having his son on the executive team at the city hall?
Really bad look for the city imho
In the next few decades people living in rural communities will absolutely start paying higher taxes. Flooding and forest fires are such an utter drain on resources and unless something is done soon (lol nothing will be done) it will get worse. In 2020 BCs entire emergency budget was lost in 2 months due to forest fires, and guess where all the money comes from, high density areas.
Part of the problem lies south of the border, where the officials there have refused to put a dam in place on the Nooksack.
But if we did our jobs we wouldn't get to make so much fucking money :'((((((((
Building a community at the bottom of a lake seems unfortunate.
I’m convinced canada is a slightly less worse version of the US. I thought Canadian governments were supposed to solve problems, unlike their neighbors down south?
Taxing the rich politically connected for infrastructure needs is hard and might cost your some rich friends, but it's easier just to defer all that maintenance and post a surplus like Ralph Klein did for decades. No harm has ever come from deferring essential infrastructure maintenance right?
The flooded areas shouldn't be drained, the wetlands should be restored. People who lost property should be compensated along the scheme of what the land cost when it was drained, adjusted for inflation. We need to restore wetlands and lakes to secure Canada from climate change.

Wait, so is it a one in 200 year flood, or is it climate change..? Gotta love people instantly calling it climate change with absolutely zero supporting evidence.
nice shot... Ironic that the most recognizable feature is the part that wasn't there for the 76 Olympics...

Is it still called the Big Owe?
I moved to Montréal July 1. The Olympic stadium peaking over the horizon was the first thing I saw to say "I'm here," when I was still about thirty minutes away by car. It was so cool, I'll never forget that. 
Now I can see it framed by the buildings looking down Mont-Royal
https://i.imgur.com/r19uAix.jpg
I also shot this structure, from this angle on lomography purple and a nikon f100.
Looks great,  even though it looks like it's throwing up on the city of Montreal
Anyone else see a screaming three-eyed monster?
Ah yes, the famous bowl. There is so much tension in the way the whole stadium is made it's next to impossible to implode it without debris flying for a few miles around. If the local gov wanted to tear it down they'd need a few billions. 
That French architect really screwed us, the contractors really screwed us, and a lot of Montreal got free materials from that building site.
Kinda neat they still have their Olympic venues, Vancouvers have all been made into community centers and sold off as condos
im stoned as fuck thats hard to look at
Looks positively fucking dystopian.
Absolutely beautiful. Aren’t we still paying for this thing.
You sure did...
The theme for the Olympics that year? Yelling Robots Vomiting.
Looks like they’re doing work on the Truman show
That's not a park this is just the tip of the tower of the stadium of the park.
That thing will never not look evil.
looks like a giant ice scraper.

>The senator, who was fully vaccinated against the virus, had been   
hospitalized due to complications from COVID-19 in October. An   
autoimmune condition affecting her lungs had made her “particularly   
vulnerable to the pandemic,” her office said in a statement last week.
It states she had pre existing auto immune lung disease. COVID tipped her over the edge.
RIP, senator. <3
That sucks.  Rest In Peace ❤️
Requiesce in pace, Senator.

Vaccine effectiveness wearing off
over time? Expecting booster push soon.
Another person with a fatal terminal illess died of covid.  Sad
That right there is deeply concerning to anyone who has any lung condition, autoimmune condition or is immunocompromised for any other reason. There is a lot of evidence to suggest that the vaccines don't work well for these vulnerable people, and this unfortunate Senator happens to be one of them. We can just hope that the [COVID-19 drugs](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/17/how-covid-antiviral-drugs-from-merck-and-pfizer-work-effectiveness.html) will be able to help these people if these vaccines are not effective. Rest in peace.
Much as I am 100% in favour of booster shots, I don't honestly know if it would have helped her. It certainly wouldn't have hurt and it may have, but those with autoimmune issues are at increased risk and there is still a lot of unknowns for them, which makes it all the more frightening.
Preventing infection is the best course of action. The vaccine helps, but anyone with autoimmune issues should be wearing N95 masks around others.
Covid is in the air, not just the droplets, and cotton masks/surgical masks aren't sufficient at filtering like N95s are.
She was too young. Fuck this fucking virus.
[removed]
Did you even read the article?
It was more her pre-existing condition that made her extremely volunerable regardless of vsccine or not. Just vsccine increased her chances, unfortunately not enough to survive thr illness.
Or at least update the vaccine to keep up with the latest variant, that was one of the perks of using mRNA tech, quicker turnaround to update it. 
It doesn't really make much sense that we are still investing so much into a vaccine that were not seeing the returns that we had hoped for.
[removed]
I am not even ~allowed~ to wear anything better than a regular surgical mask at work. In a long term care.
Been using only n95s for me and the folks since this pandemic started.  The regular masks are a joke, they don't protect.  
I think I recall today that they are now finally admitted, at least for those at increased risk, to now wear "medical" grade masks.
And this is what I needed to uninstall reddit again you guys are crazy
I remember hearing of a liveleak video of a guy in Wuhan wearing a hazmat suit keeling over and dying of covid-19, what's a tissue paper coated in plastic gonna do?

Fucking people, man
Disgusting behaviour. Catch the little turds and make them clean it off, then put them in the slammer for a few months
In the last month there have been [similar incidents in Trenton](https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/residents-fuming-as-tombstones-vandalized-at-trenton-ont-area-cemeteries-1.5639594) and [Kingston. ](https://globalnews.ca/news/8331947/graves-vandalized-kingston-cataraqui-cemetery/)
When there’s no fear of parents parenting your face off for being a delinquent little shit:
r/iamatotalpieceofshit
Fucking kids
Who raised this scum. Scum did.
My hometown is so gross :(
How awful. They have zero spray painting skills. I feel like this was done by 12 year olds. Parents of Belleville children and teens, check yo kids hands for blue paint.
I don’t get it!   How ill does someone have to be to want to or find pleasure in this vandalism?   I hope the culprits are caught,  then forced to pay for and clean up the damage!
This happened early last month too.. my grandparents gravestones were spared then.. i hope they didn't get defaced this time around.. i'll have to hear from family in belleville.
They will have to grow up with this shit in mind and guilt will always follow them.
Come on guys its just peacefully protesting against the dead.  That's what cbc tells me
Graves are there for the living, not the dead, this is a crime against their loved ones.
I agree with the sentiment, but I wouldn't want them touching the grave of my loved one again. Make them pick up trash on the side of the road or something.
A few years, at least. This is a crime against humanity. Put whoever raised them in there with 'em.
This makes it seem pretty organized
What's happening in that area? Is this the result of the changes of time on a conservative area where the main economic activity is military related?
My whole family is from there although I grew up in Quebec. It's sad to see how bad things are getting. My cousin once told me it was the capital of teen pregnancies for a while and ... I don't doubt that. 
I have family who works for the cops in the area and it's such a mess lately . Yet it's such a beautiful area. Can anyone explain?
Grew up in the 70s when beating the shit out of your kids was still the parenting norm and this sort of shit *still* happened back then too. So, no, the presence or absence of corporal punishment doesn't change the fact that there are people in this world who are destructive, antisocial assholes.

I doubt Del Duca can beat Ford but its looking like the OLP will rebound next election.
Also looks like Ford won't get a majority.
We live with a parliamentary system. There are more than two parties.
Lived in Ontario for over 50 years and have no idea who Del Duca is. I don't give him much of a chance.
My prediction is that if Ford removes all COVID restrictions next spring he will win a majority. The NDP and the liberal party seem to think that advocating for endless COVID restrictions is a winning strategy. It’s honestly the main reason I’ll probably vote Ford. I don’t know why they won’t let it go.
Fun Fact: Horwath has been around so long, people born when she was selected NDP leader are now having their Bar/Bat Mitzvahs. If she sticks around after this election, they'll be able to vote the election after that.
We seriously gotta choose between Doug Ford, Horwath and Del Duca… utter shite, dog shite and festering dog shite
The Liberal brand name will help the Liberals gain a lot of seats back. Del Duca will just be at the head of that train. And it will be mainly at the expense or the NDP, who have not shown they are deserving of their status as official opposition. But, with Trudeau in power, it's likely Ford wins again.
Who the hell would willingly vote for Doug Ford again?
And polls said NDP can form a minority government last time... Oh well.
Come on Ontario, let's give the NDP a chance to mess it up.
I think okay job for what was given to him fuck the liberals nothing but scandals with them wynne, mcgunity
I predict "buck-a-gram" campaign platforms!
I'm voting Ford again lol.
Will either party do anything about the housing bubble?
Can we get neither? Fuck NDP too.
The Cons will win ON again. Ford, for all his faults, has experience with playing both sides, and there is no real competition.
Well have have had very bad politicians  in Ontario for at least since the 80"s (don't remember them before). And we will get some boat anchor to screw Ontario even more in the next election.
Doesn't make a difference if it's  Liberal/Conservative/NDP they are all dog shit and look after themselves and their corporate handlers.
The definition of insanity is to repeat the same actions and expect a different results. Cons and Libs have stripped away our nation piece by piece to the highest bidder and no matter how sweet their words seem, their actions rarely compare.
SHOCKER
Those guys are starting to resemble the Greens.  Are Senators even elected?
Am overall embarrassment of a political party. Far from fit to govern the country.
All the conservative senators are Harper appointees. They take their orders from Harper. He seems to be currently embroiled in a fight with O'Toole. They should just do it in a cage on PPV.
Hilarious that O'Toole ran on "proven track of leadership" because he was in Cadets or something like that before going into politics, and now the wheels have totally come off his clown car
I’d just boot them all from caucus…and maybe just boot the senate in general.
How are they defying him when Batters is in an unelected position that O'Toole has no power to take away?
He should have just agreed to a leadership review. If it went well- great, and we never have to hear from Batters again. If it didn't, well, it'll be a revolving door of lackluster, uncharismatic old white men who push the party back to the right.
Would the party of Caroline Mulroney, please report the the Conservative Party HQ. There is an upcoming position your father thinks may be of interest for you. Caroline Mulroney please report in soon.
["Our caucas has its act together!" crows O'Toole.](https://nationalpost.com/news/john-ivison-our-caucus-has-its-act-together-says-otoole)
"As always, I continue to support Erin O'Toole," tweeted Conservative Senate leader Don Plett. "I just don't support anything he *says* or *does*."
I think we should have a random senate. Like jury duty. Give senators a term, say 4 years on a staggered rotation so you're only replacing 1/4 of them per year.
Interested citizens of voting age, who have not held federal elected office, no other restrictions, can put their names in the pool for a chance to be named a senator for their region. To minimize the damage that a loon or creep could do, maybe expand the pool to something like 260 senators (20 from each electoral region). Or divide it up more by population, whatever suits.
It can't possibly be a worse method than the one we've got now, where cronies and friends of whichever government happens to be in power when a senator kacks it are appointed for life* to a cushy, no-oversight government sinecure that also gets to make laws.
Huge leadership mistake for him to do this to her. He should've just let her prance around asking for signatures. She would've never gotten enough. All he's done is out more attention to her.
This is because O'Toole's leadership isn't. There should be a challenge, and if there is a challenge to his leadership, he's going to lose. He never should have been the leader of this party. The fat old white guy club put him in place, when the leadership should have gone to Dr. Lewis. If she had been the leader during the election, the conservatives probably would have won it. 
I say this as a fat old white guy.
Maybe he should fire all the Conservative appointments Senators like Trudeau did when he fired all the Liberal Senators.
Abolish the senate,  it’s a club with a pension for individuals who do nothing!
[deleted]
No.  Not even close.  There are sham elections that are held in Alberta, but they have no actual meaning except for Conservative governments to complain about their people not getting appointed to the senate by federal Liberals.  Because the Alberta senate nominees are always hard core Tories.  There's an independent process and then the PM appoints new senators.  Nobody is actually elected in the senate, which is why they have limited power and authority.
tory tussle!
All Harper's got is razor sharp helmet head and torturous singing.
He was an Air Force Captain, and then a corporate lawyer for GM or Ford busting unions.  It was Harper and Scheer that never had a real job between university and politics.
From caucus for sure.
Huh? Why would a minister want to become a useless senator?
Cost of housing, period.
Who doesn't want to spend their life in a micro sized apartment with another adult and no space to spread out? 
Simple things like having a BBQ, turning the music up occasionally, having space to work on a hobby, growing a small garden, having a pet or a kid should not be aspirational luxuries for two adults working fulltime and living responsibly. Those should be minimums.
Maybe because people don't want to a pay a million dollars for a view of the newest needle centre? Maybe becuase people want green space not homeless encampments next to the playground? Maybe people don't want to pay 20% extra for everything? Maybe people don't want to get shot at a child's birthday? And maybe people don't want hear noise 24 hrs a day.
Houses under 750?
As someone who bought 10 acres of farmland and is building a homestead I can say the reason I'm doing it is because I'm increasingly losing confidence in the foundational institutions of our nation and want some resilience. 
I don't think our country is going to collapse but we have some very serious issues that are not even being talked about that are going to lead to real problems. 
Additionally the city I was born and raised in has been extremely negatively effected by mass immigration and I only see this getting worse with mr socks at the wheel.
Adding subdivisions and Tim Hortons to small towns isn't revitalization, just suburbanization. This isn't a new trend either. In the USA (always ahead of us in land use trends), this happened a generation ago.
Pshhhh small towns are not booming, unless you go near major urban centers, and it is pretty clear what is behind that.
Housing crisis obviously
If the power goes out for 3-4 days in the winter where do you want to be? On a homestead with a backup generator and a fireplace, or a condo in a city? Guess which one costs less.
If we were serious about climate change/energy crisis this wouldn’t be happening. Rural living is far more resource intensive. It’s only cheaper because of oil subsidies and autocentric zoning stifling pedestrian/transit development that could house more people, more densely, for cheaper with unintuitively less noise/more greenspace. Roads and parking lots just take up that much of our urban space. In a few decades we won’t be able to afford the roads and the suburbs full of single family homes that we’ve built. It won’t be because of any meager carbon tax. It’ll just be because of the cost of energy.
The part that I worry about is that a lot of the drive out to rural areas is being driven by the shift to remote working, which we're still uncertain on the long term trend here. Some companies may maintain it, but others may push for a return to work. If the trend goes back to a regular expectation of in person in most industries, what happens to these towns that have seen a sudden surge in development.
We could easily see the return of empty store fronts again.
I personally think we should want to see Canada's growth be more well rounded, with it being in both the rural and urban areas, but, it's going to take these rural areas being able to generate economic growth, but it's a challenge to do so.
If the world stays with remote work being a lot more common place, then, it may still work, but we'll need to wait and see.
I grew up in a small town, then moved to the city, fell in love with a city boy and now that we’ve retired we got out. We had a lot of responsibility in the city with aging parents, so our life was never really our own until they passed.
Housing is affordable.
It seems like a better lifestyle. Humans are animals and the urban environment we have created isn't suited for man the animal.
Work from home means a professional can live in cottage country all year if they want.
I think work from home is game changing.
Points at GTA "that"
I left southern Ontario for northwestern Ontario and I know I'll never return. My wages jumped by approximately 40% and housing prices dropped by 200-300%. I bought a house for 230K in June and I now enjoy a 5 minute commute to my office. I do miss Toronto and some of the luxuries the city has, but now that I don't live paycheck to paycheck when I do go visit Toronto I can afford to have fun. I'm glad I decided to live simple and enjoy a few vacations a year where I can indulge in those luxuries. I may miss a lot of international restaurants (Jamaican, Taiwanese, Korean, Italian) but I look forward to seeing the actual countries and eating the food on the land, amongst the people. Small town living isn't for everyone but it's definitely for me
This is just a natural trend. Here in Manitoba people who can’t afford to live in Winnipeg move to niverville and steinbach and others driving up the prices displacing the citizens of those townships causing them to flood to other communities driving up their prices. It’s a vicious circle.
Cost of living
Quality of life
Those are the two main reasons we left and we actually owned a house in the lower mainland
That was a long article to say 'small town have broadband now'
Good old Canada Province.
When it rains it pours.
I built on high ground.
like, seriously Yankees. If I am familiar with Idaho and Rhode Island, then you guys can familiarize yourselves with British Columbia
As generic Canada Provincial # 2 341 567, it is the best Canada Province
Thomson-Reuters is Canadian based, and headquartered on Bay Street.
I guarantee you most Canadians couldn't label Rhode Island or Idaho on a map.
For anyone working on Bay Street, I think Canada ends at Eglinton. Maybe Lawrence if they're adventurous. Without a doubt, they pack their passports when they fly to their Muskoka cottage, just in case...
Rhode Island is the tiny one off to the right, and Idaho is one of the squares in the middle, right?
Thankfully, I am not one of those. Not sure if I could get all 50 on a blank US map, but well over 40 anyways.
ETA: printed a map and filled it out. Got all of them, unless I mixed up a couple New England states.
Idaho looks like a big L

So much for a 2 year moratorium to rebuild the stock. This is what happens when you destroy their habitat and food sources.
Modern trawlers with advanced fish catching technology decimated the stocks beyond their capacity to replenish. Factor in the enormous amount of non-commercial bycatch which was vital to the stability of the ecosystem and the inevitable happened.
People under maybe 50 years old today will live through the collapse of our ocean ecosystem. The only way to prevent it is to immediately stop almost all commercial fishing and give the oceans decades to replenish and find balance again. The oceans cannot compete with our ability to find and catch fish on such a massive industrial scale.
*But we need to overfish TODAY because investors want their profits NOW. They don't care that they can make more over a longer period if we prioritise sustainability because that can't be written in this or next year's quarterly reports.*
When I was in school in the 50s we learned that cod were so plentiful in the Grand Banks that they would slow the passage of ships. My MP is from a political party that refuses to recognize climate change. I am not hopeful.
This is an important topic to discuss for several reasons.
First is the reality that the east coast cannot fish like it has been. It has to permanently reduce its fishing and its fishing approach to a fraction of what it is doing now.
Second is that this is devastating to an economy already in pain. Sustainable resource practices are not as nice short term as unsustainable ones.
Third is how unlikely it is that we will be sustainable - there are few examples in human history where people have not abused the opportunity to liquidate resources instead of sustainably using them. 
Fourth is that Canada itself has a terrible history with fishery management, specifically with cod. We fished way too much, it got political and we destroyed a major fishery permanently.
Fifth is that Canada is likely to destroy this one too and what do we do about it?
Sixth is that we can consider the implication for the rest of our resource practices - if we continually fail on this one against short term economics, then how will be ever addressed harder issues like climate change or the other dozens of unsustainable liquidations occurring?
Seventh is that other global fisheries are getting crushed too - while yes, China is particularly bad, plenty of other nations are engaged in a slow motion car crash. If the world banned fishing nets and sonar then maybe the fish could stand a chance, but we won’t.
And we were taught that “the tragedy of the commons” was just a metaphor. Sustainability! How does it work?!? 🤔
Should have diversified
I remember all of the “In cod we trusted” signs in the maritimes when I lived there in the 2000s.
Stocks ?? Buying the dip !
Late 80s all over again. What's that quote about not knowing history, again?
If we banned draggers and went back to hook and line fishing, not only would the ecosystem benefit, but more people would be employed, handlining requires a lot more labour than dragging.
What I think is needed is scattered sections of safe zones where marine life can flourish,  as areas become over populated they will move to other pastures where we could fish.
Today dollars are all that matters!!
The Vikings said that they could walk across the Atlantic on the Cod. It's like watching a slow motion car crash.

Keep sending your MP emails every single day, get your friends to do the same. Annoy them until they acknowledge it then amp it up until they do something. I’m sure there’s a way you can make it automsted
It's really a simple fix, cull a few seals, limit the fishery to handline only, reduce quota for now, and ban dragging all together.
The only issue is this would upset the DFOs corporate freinds
They did.
But now people don't like Petroleum or Open Pit Mining.
NL's problem is that it inhabits an extremely barren hunk of Canada that features valuable resources that are increasingly out of favour to produce/procure, despite demands.
>What's that quote about not knowing history, again?
I believe it goes: "What's that quote about not knowing history, again?"
Fish will also skyrocket in price.  We'll most likely keep overfishing until they're all gone.  Now let focus on more important things like how much more we can increase our immigration targets next year to help suppress wages.
This just proves that they hold encryption keys to every major provider.
Although, It's extremely easy to make an uncrackable messaging system. So i don't see why they would pick on this one company.
Welcome to communist Canada
Yes, they did same thing with truecrypt.
It was shut down by US regulators. Even just reading the headline would tell you that.
Welcome to reading the article.
They could not even read the headline, no way the article is going to be read.
Lots of the people against seal hunting aren't even vegan. They just think that meat from the grocery store is somehow more humane than hunting animals.
I’m a Newfoundlander and I eat it all the time. It’s been in my family’s recipe book since 1705. It’s cultural for us too. Ever read the book “death on the ice?”. Culturally ingrained.
Definitely more ethical than factory farming.
But they’re cute
Don’t you know cute lives matter more than smelly ugly ones?
“There was a lot of misinformation throughout the past decades about seal and seal products,” Romy Vaugeois, national coordinator of the network, told Cabin Radio of the project.
“We need to start by educating Canadians about the fact that seals are not extinct, they’re abundant … but also that seal products exist, and they’re out there, and they’re really good for health and for the environment.”
The cultural practices of my ancestors were colonizing other countries by force. Now, it's considered barbaric.
Seal hunting is barbaric as well.
I’m not against sealing but I dislike how Canada’s solution to conservation often involves culling wildlife to save another. 
I personally would refrain from eating marine mammals due to the contamination but each their own.  I had it once but it was very freezer burnt so it tasted and smelled like fishy beef but chewy. I think it was ringed seal. Maybe I just failed at making it though. 
It also makes me uncomfortable how much China loves buying our wildlife. I guess someone has to buy all those seal penises…I just worry that selling wildlife parts create an appetite for  poaching.
Would sooner buy a seal fur jacket over anything else if it was available and affordable.
From some quick googling the average seal fur jacket seems to go for about $1500 to $3000.
As long as the population is stable, club to your hearts content ❤
I dont buy milk if the seal is broken,
Just because something is cultural doesn't mean it's OK.
Or synthetic clothes falling apart during washes and being sent into rivers, streams, lakes and oceans.
I thought the part the public were upset about was the whole clubbing thing…
Nope
Why is it not okay?
Doesn't mean it's not.
What makes its ok? Who gets to decide? Why does your opinion matter?
If clubbing is done properly it’s pretty humane.
Your supposed to strike once and make it painless and instant.
I thought it was becoming far more common to shoot them.
But the vast majority of the time, the seals take multiple strikes in order to be killed. They die in a state of physical and psychological suffering. This isn’t controversial. It’s just the incredibly grim reality

government will introduce mandate if animals refuse the vaccine, will have to leave the zoo.
So you mean to say now our vaccines are also horse vaccines?
Wait till CNN reports Canadians are now taking large cat vaccines.
Why are these Tigers not wearing masks?
Will occur in other provinces as well:
>The Toronto and Calgary zoos both said they would also be vaccinating their animals once a shot becomes available. Toronto added that about 140 of its animals would be eligible, including primates, big cats and swine.
Now announcing Tiger King: Season 2 Vaccination Boogaloo.
Sorry, poor countries of the world, you’ll have to get in line behind our zoo animals. 😬
I know it’s different vaccine (don’t know about ingredients) but seems messed up that we’re vaccinating animals when the vulnerable and healthcare workers in 3rd world nations do not yet have access to the vaccines.
"BUT MUH FREEDOMS!", said the tigress.
Have we even had cases of animals getting covid?
To avoid an animal lockdown I suppose it's a necessary move.
Why are we injecting animals with vaccines now?
When will vaccines be available for pets?  Seems like eliminating all animal reservoirs will have to be a thing if we're to beat this virus
Is it still a wild animal if it lives in a zoo?
tigers are not wearing masks cancel them
Ohh the Tyranny!
Is there any agency that approves vaccines designed for humans to wild animals? How does this work?
Zoos should be banned. Fucking disgusting
I like where you're going with that.
Giving lions a human deviruser. Unbelievable.
Unfinished business ... bury that WE business so deep only the mole men will ever find it.
He certainly wasn't in a hurry to get back to work..
No wonder asset owners and investors in Toronto and Vancouver voted for this elite clown.
He hates sitting inside HOC.
> Trudeau looks to address unfinished business as Conservatives squabble
Weird.  I figured unfinished business addressed itself.
Normalized corruption is subjecting this country to corporatism at all of our expense.
We're stuck with this idiot for 4 years, and the other front runner needs to get bent just as much.
Politicians never are. If there's one thing that crosses all party boundaries, it's poor work ethic.
I'll believe it when I see it.
When I see a report saying a politician "may do this" or "is considering doing that", what it means is, the politician was asked a question, didn't have a prepared answer, so they just said "maybe".
Biden has made his entire career by taking no strong position on anything.
I see the 4500$ bonus for union made EV being killed in the Senate.
Same old game.  What does he want in exchange for that?
The thing is, that despite the trade deals we've already signed prohibiting these tax benefits from harming our industries, we still have to go to the Americans and beg for them to follow agreements they've already signed.
We here a lot of talk about "allies" and "friendly nations" when they want something, but appear oblivious to our interests otherwise.
Makes me wonder what we're giving up to get a token concession.
I don't trust these bastards as far as I could throw them, the US has never dealt fair and if they decide to renege we have no leverage to stop them.
is this for real?!
I wish he would've just come for a photoshoot in BC to virtual signal.
Sarcasm!  If it’s a tax credit and you don’t pay taxes there is no credit!!!!!!
The Senate wants this wrapped up before Christmas which leaves 3-4 weeks of lobbying. Biden isn't going to do anything at this point other than sign what's put in front of him and the Senate is more concerned about taxes and parental leave portions of the bill rather than EV credits.
What we needed is to have US politicians wrapped around our fingers like China does with certain Liberal politicians.
Let’s go Brandon!
+1
It's not going to happen. They're not going to give a $20,000 tax break to Canadian automakers, when the #1 American EV automaker does not qualify.
The Biden admin doesn't like Tesla, but they're not that politically stupid.
They're also asking an ex-diplomat here which basically means they are in no better position to know than you or I what is actually being discussed behind closed doors.
Biden has taken a lot of strong positions over his career that the Democrats have spent the last two years trying to memory hole.
Biden no longer has the mental capacity to decide what to eat for breakfast. His career is currently trying to string together a single thought.
These decisions are decided by people behind closed doors more than ever.
I would imagine Toyota and Tesla are going to be lobbying HARD to kill that.
Biden really hates Musk
It's not a "bonus".  It's a tax credit.
I am pro markets (not free markets there is a difference, the former is sensible acknowledgement and the latter is ideological fluff). And I admit US protectionism has gone against the spirit of signed trade agreements, they bully their trade partners because they can. But this actually sounds like an interesting move. We should consider instead of a tariff which will hurt consumers, matching the program with any cars built using Canadian assembly lines. Not necessarily full vehicles but key parts for instance.

> In the May 2020 video, Herman speaks of an invasion of her homeland by Arabs, Africans, and Asians, and suggests that for a time, German speakers in Europe may need to become refugees themselves, and seek temporary refuge in Canada, until things are “solved” in Europe.
I have some bad news for these folks about Canada...
I heard about German Nazis moving to Cape Breton. I saw some weird advertisement video they made.
I wonder if the far right buying up land on the far right side of Nova Scotia (and Canada) is a coincidence.
Did nazi that coming.
Marketing Cape Breton as a “refuge” for “clear thinkers”: Two development companies have sold 144 lots in Richmond and Inverness counties to German-speaking non-residents "who want to live with the values of Germany from 1933 to 1945." 
Canada is just as racist as america just not as cartoonishly evil about it
SHhhh, lets not spoil the surprise.
Cape Breton itself is whiter than snow.
If they're looking for small government, low taxes, and free markets, Nova Scotia might provide a bit of a surprise.
>Two development companies have sold 144 lots in Richmond and Inverness counties to German-speaking non-residents "who want to live with the values of Germany from 1933 to 1945." 
>
>Canada is just as racist as america
Interesting article, and a bizarre story... but did you just generalize about our entire country of 39,000,000 people, because 100 conspiracy nuts from Germany bought real estate in Cape Breton?
> Canada is just as racist as america just not as cartoonishly evil about it 
Not following the logic of how this story shows this
America is fucked but I don’t see the connection to Nazi germany.
Jesus fucking Christ
We are America with fewer guns. Neither country should be compared to Nazi Germany though.
Everywhere has racists.
we dont need those shitbags here.
Yes, they did.
They also ignored that these people could just move to Alabama if they wanted to be American.
You don't see parallels between the Brown Shirts and the Proud Boys?
"144 lots sold to Germans who want to live the values from 1933-1945" 
What was going on in Germany during that time frame?
*bill regulating online hate and vitriol will have*
Oh so now its not just hate speech is vitriol to 
*Bernie Farber, founder of the Canadian Anti-Hate Network, said it would be better to introduce a bill and finesse it in a parliamentary committee than see further delays.*  
***“I would rather have poorly worded legislation than nothing at all,****” he said.*
Carry on nothing to see here.Yep lets just have more vague laws and that fine because you can always appeal it. Meanwhile you have probably lost your job and all your money appealing it for years,but hey you are living in a cardboard box and lost everything but hey you won your case
Ah yes, because we've FIXED EVERYTHING else wrong in the country, such as :
- surging inflation
- housing crisis
- public transit in major cities
- wage stagnation
- mental heath crises 
But no, let's crack down on internet trolls!
So now we want to police vitriol too? As if that's going to be an easy thing to define or enforce?
What constitutes vitriolic is completely subjective, and its going to depend on someone's personal opinions, political leanings, and point of view. 
This is 1984 stuff. We already have laws against hate speech, there is no freedom of speech in Canada as it stands right now. If you see someone inciting hate you can can report it to law enforcement because it is already illegal.This is an attempt to try and control the public narrative and limit discussion and criticism of legitimate targets.
I hate this.
Anyone who thinks giving the government the ability to regulate speech on the internet is an idiot. 
We have legal court mechanisms to deal with this. That is where the government should be leaving it. With law enforcement and with the courts. 
If Trudeau really wants to spend time working on something he can start by working on banning foreigners from owning homes in Canada, banning the advertising of homes outside of Canada and working on making laws that will actually target the shady shit that relators do
They’re working hard at taking our freedoms away. 
Housing? Ignored 
Healthcare? Ignored 
Safety and security? Ignored
Quoting a passage that says it best about taking away freedoms, one at a time in the name of expediency...
&nbsp;
First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—because I was not a socialist.
Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out— because I was not a trade unionist.
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—because I was not a Jew.
Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.
-- Martin Niemöller
If this rubbish goes through you can kiss platforms like this one goodbye as hate speech will include anything the current regime does not like.  No criticism of the party will be tolerated. Sound familiar? Just like China.
One more step toward the idiot son's socialist utopia.
You got what you voted for. Enjoy.
This is what happens when you guys go too far with the Trudeau/Castro conspiracy theories.
“I would rather have poorly worded legislation than nothing at all"
That is fucking terrifying.
This is a fucking ridiculous waste of time and money and personal freedom.
You'd have to be blind to call this a left wing government. They are intentionally stagnating progressive ideals while big businesses make big stock returns.
Stocks aren't really traceable as a political donation either, are they? This is not a level playing field at all.
>surging inflation
"LOL, I don't do monetary policy." -Trudeau
That sounds like hate speech to me.
Careful, using words and phrases like that could get you thrown in jail/s
Exactly. If you are being harassed by someone online you can report it. If you know the person, they'll for sure be talked to.
Harassment is already illegal. Government criticism isn't but if it's considered "vitriol" it will be.
Canada's "leftist" party is literally pushing for corporatist ideals to solidify power.
Neo-liberal corporatist party of Canada. Not even hiding the oligarchy anymore.
This.  All of this.
Authoritarianism, and dare I say it, government misinformation is encroaching from every angle.  Removing our ability to even talk about it is a bad, bad precedent.
Censoring online expression is for your safety and security. 
Apparently.
Here have some scraps in the form of cheap childcare. This will pay off in the form of more workers and renters in 18 years.
Housing is a booming business in Canada.
“First they came for the shitlords, and pretty much everyone was happy about it and we went on with our lives, end of story”
Fucking fascist quote if I've ever heard it.
These boneheads want to literally give us a government approved internet.
Fuck these guys.  Chapmans stood up and bought special freezers that could keep vaccines at the required storage temperature.  Without being asked   Without government money.  Because they wanted to help.

Hey everyone, go on google when you have a moment and leave a positive review for them so stupid anti-vaxxers don’t ruin their rating. Love me my ice cream 😋
LOL! Anti-vaxxers make up, what, *maybe* 10% of the population — and as we've seen, the very worst part of the population, what with terrorizing hospitals, invading primary schools, and blitzkrieging the Veteran's Memorial services.
Chapman's won't miss them.
> But the move prompted a revolt within its own workforce, with several unvaccinated staff sending the news to prominent Canadian anti-vaccine groups and issuing a call to boycott the company online.
> “It is really disappointing,” vice-president Ashley Chapman says.

Wait.
So her unvaccinated staff are claiming because Chapman's paying an extra 1$/hour as incentive that this is violating the [Geneva Convention?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions)
The Geneva Conventions...
Which only apply during times of war, between nations that have ratified the conventions.
Those Geneva Conventions?
Wat?
I'm reminding myself to buy more Chapman. Love that Canadian company!
I'm picking up some Chapmans tomorrow.
[link for a Chapman’s $4 off coupon. ](https://www.chapmans.ca/coupon/chapmans-4-annual-coupon-2021/)
Fuck THAT! Chapman’s is awesome.
We need more Canadian companies like them.
I love how these “keep the economy going” antivaxxers want to go after a Canadian success story that has displayed high moral character again and again and again.
Im not much for icecream but I will be buying Chapman’s when I do my shopping tomorrow. Thanks anti-vaxxers.
Groceries tomorrow, Chapmans now has been added to my shopping list
So these anti-vaxxers are actually calling themselves "pure bloods"? I thought that was just a stupid meme.
Not a chance.
Honestly, that's s downright decent vaccine policy. It gives employees the right to choose alternative safety measures. Antivaxxers should count that as a win. It's the best they could hope for, really.
Chapman’s No Sugar Added Black Cherry ice cream is really good, ya dumb fucks. Go boycott parsnips.
I showed this to my wife and when she finished reading she asked, "So where can we get some Chapman's Icecream?"
Anti-vaxxers don't like Chapman's? That's probably enough for me to pick up a pint of their shit next time I'm at the store. Don't even need to read the article for once.
Chapmans makes amazing ice cream and they protect their employees. Grocery day tomorrow been a while since i bought some
Huh. I’m suddenly reminded of how much I love Chapman’s ice cream.
Love Chapmans even more now.

Yes we did. And anecdotally, in conversations with all of my close male friends…. They were even willing to admit it. It was a crisis of sorts.
There was a post on r/trueoffmychest a few days ago discussing men’s mental health. More than 7,000 comments, many of them men who were struggling or had fully given up. It’s not right. We have to do better for the men in our lives. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/quks07/im_really_concerned_about_mens_mental_health/
You mean like anxiety, existential angst, depression and melancholy?
I also feel like we felt more comfortable talking about struggling, at least within my circles.
No one cares about men, my female coworker has a “white male tears” coffee mug
I'm going to take this opportunity to talk a little bit about men's depression:
**What's the number one symptom of depression in men?**
Irritability. 
Men don't typically get sad or blue when they're depressed (though some certainly do), they get irritable. Worst of all, the DSM doesn't even include irritability as a symptom for adult men, so many doctors miss it. When you see a man who's yelling at people, verbally abusive, or gets mad easily, he's very often very, very depressed.
Other signs to look for include:
* escapist behavior like working too much or not working at all
* physical symptoms: headaches, digestive problems and pain
* alcohol and drug use
* controlling, violent, and abusive behavior
* inappropriate anger
If you think you might be depressed, take the [QIDS](https://www.mdcalc.com/quick-inventory-depressive-symptomatology-qids) or Beck Depression Inventory, then share it with your doctor. Don't try to diagnose yourself with these tools. They're meant to be used by doctors and their patients together.
I'm happy to answer any questions related to men's depression if anyone has any.
In spite of decades of social engineering efforts, men are still expected to be productive bread-winners, and derive much of their sense of self-worth from this sense of productivity. When it suffers, mental health goes to shit.
Isolation is the hardest. I find women have a robust group of friends whereas men don’t. Well I don’t as I’m an introvert. So that gets to ya.
EDIT - if anyone is in downtown toronto hit me up we can hang out and go for coffee.
The other third is either tremendously wealthy or lying.
Yeah, I'm not surprised. They say attitudes are changing but men are still seen as the primary breadwinners, expected to shoulder any burden or challenge and never complain or show any emotion. When you add covid into that, it just makes things harder. Supports for men are also kind of a joke, there's too few that are specifically dedicated to men with very little availability and when people try and get men only supports, they are ridiculed or called sexist for excluding women.
[deleted]
I imagine a good number of them had mental health challenges before the pandemic too, considering the prevalence of them in our society. The pandemic has been stressful, yeah, but it's just been one thing that put pressure on the already straining joints of most people's minds. Even if the pandemic cleared up totally tomorrow, the mental health of these men wouldn't bounce back, mental health care and attention are still needed. We can't just rely on individual men publicly sharing their personal struggles and traumas in order to "inform" society before acting.
If the majority of the population is struggling, clearly there needs to be some radical changes in how we access mental health services.

I know a man personally who deals with depression and anxiety with a progressive partner who completely invalidates him and says he is weaponizing his issues. When asked how, she can't make a good answer. The best she's mustered up was "He almost didn't take our daughter shopping because he said he was too depressed."   
Meanwhile, she's hit him in the past. Several times. Everyone in her friend group empowers her. Go ahead and hit him. Girl power!
The numbers only say that 2/3 men experienced mental health challenges, not that any of these challenges were new or different in any way. 
As for further down when it starts talking about physical health I feel the need to point out that some bosses don't like to give men without children random days off and in some industries even trying to get a few hours off can be prohibitive. There's also lots of jobs where you can't just go from work right to the doctor's office because you're either generally filthy or just plain stink from the day's work.
I’m so thankful for video games. It would have been hard without the boiz in discord.
LMAO, hospitals are telling people to stay away, Family doctors offices basically aren't answering the phone, doctors are retiring and dropping patients.
My family doctor I've had since I was a kid dropped me, but they've been impossible to get a hold of for years, my wife and child both got dropped when their doctor retired.
Edit: there's legit like 6 things wrong with me at this point, fuck if I'm paying appletree $300 for 6 *phone appointments*....
As a male who has been dealing with this sort of thing most of my life, it's comforting to know that we're finally the flavour-of-the-month.  I'm absolutely certain we won't be forgotten again.

Great article for a great day. Happy international men's day!
Modern western society thinks masculinity is toxic and us working class men get treated like shit and we get talked about like we are all dumb racist or some stupid shit like that. Everything wrong with society is our fault even though we are the ones that keep the lights on, the sewers working, the food growing, the goods moving. We are the ones who keep the cogs turning but we get treated like we are disposable.
Things are fine here on the ground. 1/3 gas stations out of gas in the lower mainland, but people still living and working normally (outside of the flood zone albeit).
Selfish behavior gets highlighted a bit though. These events bring out the best and the worst in us.
Huh, below ground large diameter high pressure oil pipeline would have been useful right now
I live on Vancouver island. People were going NUTS for gas. So Friggin stupid. The trucks were merely delayed so people lost their shit.
Tesla owners really going to rub it in now…
I'm gonna have to hit up 4 gas stations to fill up now.
30l is 3 litres shy of a full tank for me. Another reason not to buy the largest SUV you can finance
*Only in the LMD/sunshine Coast/Vancouver Island.
The rest of us this doesn't affect so don't go hoard gas.
Time for a carbon diet, BC.
People are already ignoring the limits
Cars can’t run on happy thoughts and cannabis? Huh.
If it's overreach to ask citizens to wear a mask and get a vaccine during a pandemic, then it must surely be overreach to apply rationing during a shortage.  
Where are the howls about individual rights?
As if in incoming supply chains to Canada haven't been fucked for the last two years. We'll manage.
I'm sure good Canadian oil that has been extracted and refined in Canada is on its way...
Uh oh, better start building those wind and solar arrays, the first shipment of panels is en'route...
Uh oh, its almost as if multiple governments forgot to build infastructure that allows Canada to be self sufficient, that's ok Quebec well help the rest of the country...
Uh oh.
How about that pipeline bc?
Stupid question and thought here, is there any effort/possibility of bringing up gasoline from Washington state to help ease fuel problems?
This is what you get for blocking pipeline 
Let me guess, they are going to blame this on climate change. lol
How long till someone says the government is oppressing them by rationing fuel and non-essential travel....
Rationing? What's this, the great depression? An economic condition that was supposed to be prevented by printing money, ad infinitum inflation, and central banking?
Dumbest shit they could have done. Expect tomorrow to be an even bigger shit show at the pumps.
My work van is just shy of 120L, and that lasts the week usually. Guess I just be pulling out different cards to fill up if the stations set a hard cap at the pumps, cause I sure as shit ain't shopping around at 4 stations.
Pipelines. Pipe lines.
What an idiot
So he was smuggling Marijuana from a state where it is legal to purchase and consume recreationally, across an international border, to a country where it is legal to purchase and consume recreationally.
Hmm… if only there had been a better, legal way, to obtain marijuana at both the origin and destination.
skidoo skidoo, trikes n bikes.
[deleted]
There is a better way... but only if the US legalizes federally. The reason it was "trafficking" is because the US border is federal jurisdiction, and marijuana is still illegal federally.
At the gazebo we likes to fight
Licensing means its all legal, taxed, fees, etc.
He knew what he was doing was illegal if he waited for lakes to freeze and haul the product by snowmobile lol. Think the guy was paying taxes on this? He wasn't interested in doing this legally.
I'm not even mad at the punishment, we've had far more egregious crimes get slaps on the wrist on a daily basis in this country.
License or not, medical license for use or not, it is illegal to take it through customs.
>Maybe if he just got a license to sell it he would have been fine.
>Recreational pot is legal in Vermont.
But it's not legal federally, and the US federal government is the one that controls the border.
There’s no license to allow you to carry weed across an international border
It's legal in Vermont but federally it's still illegal and that's the rule set the US Border follows.
Imagine CBC missing the opportunity to point out that most Santas are white.

I thought one of them passed away?
I am pleasantly surprised to learn they are all still alive.
As a parent who had to endure this trio I think I might give this a pass.

Add in Fred Penner, Mr. Dress Up, Under the Umbrella Tree, and Size-Small Island and my upbringing was the same.
Today's Special really brings me back. It was the one with the Mannequin that comes to life every night and the mice puppets? I loved that show as kid.

This head line should read "Refusal to up wages results in reduced operating hours".
Shortage of labour not willing to be underpaid
"Grocery store owner who is also a landlord and charges 1500$ a month for rent and 500$ a month for food wonders why people won't work for him for 1200$ a month. News at 11."
Pay employees better wages and give full time hours.
Novel idea!
Pay a living wage!
I've got homies who make slightly less on unemployment benifits and throw in a couple cash jobs here nd there making just as much as they would going back to work. When you take into account their time, food, gas etc. They coming out ahead not going to work. Can't blame em
Wage Shortage
Fuck, the propaganda never ends does it?
Rules of Acquisition #211: Employees are the rungs on the ladder of success. Don't hesitate to step on them.
hmmm  "Quebec’s labour minister says stores need to become more competitive with salaries and try to encourage retired workers to come back to the labour force."
Oh you mean like if they paid their people more they might actually get enough people to work for them.  Shocking idea.  WHich is why that little quote is buried down near the bottom of the article.
"Labor shortage" wage shortage seriously wake up.
There is no labour shortage. it's simply a wage shortage. I have small businesses and I post jobs well above the min wage and I have no problem finding workers. Here's an idea. Treat your employees like good people and fire the shit ones and maybe you won't have a problem finding decent workers.
You pay for what you get… if you get nothing then maybe pay more, people aren’t stupid, why would we work for below poverty wages when there is opportunity for a better life in a different job…duh
Poor wages forcing some Quebec workers to consider having a life instead of wage slavery.
FTFY
Don’t worry Quebec. Trudeau is bringing in 500,000 immigrants a year, so you’ll be okay.
Sounds like you don’t have viable businesses if you can’t afford to pay staff normal wages, even with all the government subsidies you’re still getting.  
Good riddance
Isn’t it the employers refusal to increase wages that’s causing them to reduce hours?
Pay Canadians the market rate to work ❌
Import workers that will do shitty jobs for $15/h ✅
Article Summary:
* Quebec is experiencing a massive labour shortage in the retail trade. More than 20,000 vacancies need to be filled according to the Quebec Retail Council director general – an unprecedented amount.
* Quebec’s labour minister says stores need to become more competitive with salaries and try to encourage retired workers to come back to the labour force.
* “They have to analyze their specific situation,” Jean Boulet told Global News.
* He also said retail stores need to invest in automation and artificial intelligence to help make up for employee shortfalls.
But they won't decrease executive pay, or increase front line workers pay. Poor poor business.

Ah, so we're burning the money and inhaling the smoke.  What a waste of money.
One of my former colleagues is a researcher at LU that's been trying to gain funding for what he hopes to be a new carbon capture method that is more usable than what we have now. He's given up completely on gaining grants from the government. This has goto piss the guy off.

especially if it is not be patented. There are many allopathic practitioners working with populations that have no money. If there was a valid and effective treatment not requiring a patented and expensive medication, it would be used.

Well no shit, they fired the rest. That's how mandates work.
They self declare their vaccination status. Noone is checking.
AWESOME, LOVE READING THIS.
The other 3% are working on their resumes.
Then let's fucking open
So once they are  no longer up to date on vaccines, do they risk losing their job again? Will all non health care mandates stay? Because this shit isn't going away
It wont count soon enough and they will force a 3rd jab.
Toronto isn't canada
Still 3% have brain fucked.
I will be that 0.001% dickhead

Nice to read good things about my city.

Yes, because the only metric that should be used to determine whether restrictions should be fully lifted is how many Toronto city staff are vaccinated.
It's in Canada, is it not? Did they move to Sweden?
this would be better suited for r/toronto

... Tu buy made in Canada electric school buses...
The problem with Quebec reducing its GHG emissions is that its grid is already 100% green and renewable.
The main areas where Quebec can still improve are: Transports (trucks, cars, trains and ships) which accounts for 40% of the emissions and industry which accounts for a bit less than 30%.
As for household emissions, 80% of Quebec homes use electricity and there are upcoming bans on oil furnaces and wood stoves (Montreal has already banned wood stoves).
**So Quebec has no choice but to cut emissions in transports** while the industry is still working out how to cut their emissions.
I wonder which will come first, electric school busses or seatbelts?
The single largest emitter of c02 in Quebec is a cement factory that is set to recieve carbon credits, it was also exempted from any environmental review
priorities all fucked up
The last Lion Electric bus I saw had an electric motor, but the cabin was still heated by diesel. Maybe this has changed although I doubt it, as either the range would drop or the price would increase due to the additional batteries. Isn't calling something like that zero-emissions a little misleading? Zero emissions for propulsion, sure, but it still consumes diesel.
But our health system is collapsing at the seams...
The new buses come with seatbelts. Our School district bought a full electric bus and due to technical glitches it is currently unusable.
Not really. You’re only considering what produces more, not the trade-offs associated with it.
Closing the cement factory likely will just move those emissions somewhere else since cement demand won’t go down, you’ll lose jobs and you’ll lose valuable resource stability. 
Changing the busses to have 0 emissions benefits the Canadian economy since they’re Canadian buses, it creates jobs instead of eliminating them and has no impact on our resource industries.
So it’s big reductions in emissions for great loss, or moderate reduction for nothing. I think they made a good call tbh.
Last I checked we still need cement and there's no other way to do it
Wonder if that was just an earlier model or prototype. They currently list a highly efficient heating and cooling systems that runs on electrical that preheats or cools the bus while it is charging in order to save range and can operate in both very high and low temps.
Why are we heating the cabin of school buses? Kids need toughen up. Back in my day we walked 5 miles in the snow to get to school.
Because of all the doctors and nurses that left their jobs to go work in these bus factories?
About 10 years ago I was told by that new school busses had been ordered and that they would be coming with seat belts (information offered, not asked). Ten years later they're still running the old style.
What school board has these new busses?
Now do alberta oil lol 
Nah give the money to anyone else we would just blow it anyways
Maybe we could atleast end the review exemptions?
Do you have a link to that? I didn't see anything on a quick glance of their website.
Depending on the age of the fleet we replace busses as needed ( there is a formula) any new buses we order, we order with seatbelts. Only 2 or 3 of 20 buses currently have seatbelts.
Yeah albertan oil is absolutely disgusting given how high emissions are. It’s an absolute travesty to the environment, even without factoring in the fact they need to obliterate wetlands to mine the oil sands.
Again though, there’s other avenues we can pursue that can reduce emissions without the same economic impacts. That being said, albertas oil dependency is frightening given that oil is a Industry every major nation agrees is in decline, hell even Saudi Arabia is trying to build non-oil industries for its inevitable collapse.
Specification of heading / cooling electric while charging.

Did more digging and also found a spec sheet with a fuel tank  for a heating system
https://soderholmbus.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lion-Bus-brochure.pdf
Looks like they have different variants but clearly you are correct they do have a fuel based heating system in some of the variants. Unclear if the California version just doesn’t have the heater or what. 
Given. The body heat of a loaded buss I suspect that system would be fairly efficient unless the buss was empty.
Cool, thanks!
From your first link, Spheros and Webasto are both brands of diesel heaters. But they might have a fully electric system as well for warmer climates

Praise science.
Are they going to be required to get them or are they just available?  IIRC this age group has a higher mortality from influenza
Anyone want popcorn?
5 months ago they said double vaxxed people wouldn’t need masks. I feel like they speak before they know
Finally! Now we can reduce the average daily child death count from almost zero to almost zero!
A big deal for sick kids and that sort of thing especially.
My main issue with this is with the constant change in information regarding vaccines. AZ was good, suddenly it wasn't. Same with J\&amp;J, then Moderna got slammed for use on adults under 30 in EU and other parts of the world. What's to stop this from being a similar situation?
And why should one trust "Health" Canada ?
Medical kickback and bribery lawsuit on the horizon for Pfizer.
I guess we'll find out when Pfizer releases all their data, in 2076 by their latest request.
Money grab pure and simple. The science and stats don’t back up the need for kids to get vaccinated. 
We’re both vaccinated and we’re not letting our kid get it.
Did they release clinical data yet?
Give the province a few days to send out guidance before harassing your docs and local pharmacies!
awesome, every kid needs to get the jab to stop covid!
Edit: haha downvote me anti-vaxers
My kids will not be test subjects. I’ll wait a year even if I have to home school. Maybe some kids dying of a heart attack at 5 or 6 will force some riots with some angry ass parents.

Yep. And the residents of these small towns hate this shit. 
Drives the housing prices in these little towns right into orbit. So the people who have lived there their whole lives, cant afford to buy a home anymore because of these big city moneybags.
They might make the move, but they'll get the cold shoulder in a small town like this. 
Just the way it is.
I asked this in my home sub on this article, and I will ask it here as well.
>Moves like the McLatchies have raised questions about whether employees should retain the same-sized paycheques when they move to less expensive areas. 
So if I move from a cheap neighborhood working from home, to a much more expensive one and still work from home, the company should pay more money because of where I live?
Am I reading that right? Or does it magically only work the other way around?
They should talk about how much these entitled rich city dwellers are ruining the housing market in NS
This article belongs to  the category of "news" but it's really designed as social conditioning. 
Because here's the question posed
> Moves like the McLatchies have raised questions about whether employees should retain the same-sized paycheques when they move to less expensive areas.
How's this a justifiable concept is beyond me.
Once this notion gestates, once it hits zeitgeist and becomes something people can cite including those who decide your paycheque, it's already too late. 
This idea that you "deserve" the cut in pay is ludicrous in every sense but what's really fascinating ti me is that a national "news" institution is leader in spreading the gospel of bringing proles down at every turn.
This is really so frustrating. Proles just cant catch a break with elites not breathing down your neck.
this is still a story yet to be told, really. i've been freelance (read: mercenary) and working for home for almost 15 years. since the pandemic and the move to WFH for a lot of regularly employed people, i'm seeing more and more opportunity as companies realize they can hire someone like me who's already very experienced in the WFH game and save a lot of money over keeping a salaried person on payroll. like, there has always been a fair bit of work out there for me, it's doubled since late 2020, and a lot of it is make up work.
it's all well and good until a guy like me comes along and shows your employer that we can do your job better, faster, and cheaper. and we've been doing it a loooong time.
expect some upheaval and unpleasant surprises due to this in the coming years.
“Leave your family and move to a remote area where you probably can’t even find a doctor because we don’t care about the housing crisis” - state media
I live in a town that has a huge water problem now that the housing boom has hit. Old town council loves the money that these projects brought in but didn’t hold the developers to paying for upgrading any utilities. The tax payers vote out “old boys club” of a town council and now are on the hook for paying upgrades. Property taxes being raised 3-4% annually, water bills will go up almost $1000 a year to pay for this neglect. FML
These people are the ones who are buying up all the middle-income and low-income housing in my area, flipping it, and raising up all the housing values, and creating demand for developers to get rid of our green spaces and put in more housing.
My city is farming and factories. We can't \*\*\*\*\* afford these prices and we like our trees!
[deleted]
I can not stress how much I hate people that do this. I live in a small town, and I have most of my life. Because of all these city folks, there is nowhere for locals to live as prices are driven up. 
Sure for the city guy making $150,000 a year it’s not a problem, but the guy from town who is making $45,000 sure is feeling it. 
And they bring their entitlement attitude with them. They treat their neighbours with contempt and scoff at things like a local butcher. We already had non-Canadians come in on mass, and now city folk are doing it too.
>Some big tech companies have said pay may be lowered for staff who move to less-expensive areas
First and foremost fuck the tech industry, if they can't pay a living wage in their cities then they are the problem.
Yes and thanks to people like this there's not a house for sale under $450K in the small midwestern Ontario town of 1,200 I grew up in.
Ontario's already a lost cause thanks to this shit let's see how many more provinces this can fuck over, looks like Nova Scotia is next.
Makes me thankful I live in Saskatchewan where winter is 7-9 months long it hits -40°c without the wind chill in the winter 30°c+ in the summer, the roaming clouds of mosquitoes could probably carry away cats, dogs and small children if mosquitoes were slightly more coordinated, sane people don't move here.
Damn these people, now they add  insult to injury by contributing  to the local economy , getting  new furnature, landscaping,  getting the car fixed locally, and paying property taxes, shame!
More affordable..... for now
Kind of like residents of big cities being forced into accepting sky-high real estate prices because of people who aren't even from this fucking country taking over their neighbourhoods?  Just asking, no reason.
Population growth is a reality, so get used to it.  As you said, just the way it is.
>They might make the move, but they'll get the cold shoulder in a small town like this. Just the way it is.
This is why I moved away from the small town I was in. I didn't have any money, but because I moved there and didn't grow up i got the cold shoulder and was routinely told its because I'm not from there. 
Its not my whole experience living in small towns but I've found unless you're EXACTLY what they are looking for, and act exactly like they want, a lot of people won't welcome you. Even if you're the reason for growth that has allowed them to get a lot of new services, or funding.
Yeah fuck those Canadians for moving, and trying to make a better life for themselves. Let's just be ignorant bigots and ignore them.
I do a lot of work in a small town in Ontario and I can attest to this. Locals can barely afford to live and many are having to move into an apartment with 4 or 5 other people just so they can afford a roof and food.
I'd be interested to find out some stats in terms of impact  this is having as I suspect the number of people - as these in the article -  is really really low. 
But as always nobody has actual numbers, only a case or two and then extrapolate as if it's a tsunami.
"Big city moneybags"
You mean sucessful, hardworking tax payers who earned it? Someone making 100k and up in the city is contributing a lot more to our country than Joe Blow making min wage in Campbellford.
Remote work is destroying the notion of a local income.
At least these people are making money in Canada and (presumably) paying taxes to the CRA.
I got the burger king branded vaccine, can I enter canada?
I cannot believe we are still requiring PCR tests for Canadian returns if this is indeed true.
I guess when Canadians call for us to open up, understandably tired of lockdowns, this is a part of that. This move is because majorty of the developing world uses these vaxxes. If we want to be open it means this.
But there is potentially good news. Knowing these vaccines have less effectiveness but letting these folks in suggest authorities are entering the endemic phase of the disease.
Why not Sputnik then?
Have it your way
Yuuuuup.
Not WHO approved, I guess. Adding these three expands Canada's list to match the WHO list. 
Good news for me as someone who has been vaccinated with Sinopharm.
I’m lovin’ it
Don’t worry the increased demand for housing will definitely not be increasing the prices of houses. /s
I'm pretty moderate, and I understand and appreciate the need to have immigration in order to sustain our economy. I have never opposed it before.
That being said, this is the most tone deaf government I have ever heard in my life. We have a food, housing, and wage shortage and they are gleefully offering to import workers if there is "appetite from businesses and communities for more workers".
What a slap in the face to the rest of us struggling to get by.
Fuck this country. No shame.
"High levels of foreign-born workers, for example, have helped to mitigate wage pressures in Canada in recent months at a time when inflation has been surging."
Wage suppression is their goal and they openly admit it.
What the fuck are we supposed to do? Write letters that go nowhere? I've never felt more hopeless by the day.
these people hate you. there is no other explanation for this insanity. we're teetering on a razor's edge trying to juggle inflation, housing, medical care, agriculture, and failing businesses and these fucking clowns want to bring in more people to drive up the demand for all of the above. fucking unreal.
just what our housing, healthcare, inflation, and cost of food crisis needs.
Good news for employers who don't want to pay a living wage, I guess.
I'm flabbergasted. Does the general public want this? What is their opinion?
Solve the fucking housing crisis first.
This would not bother me if we were at the same time instituting a nation wide building programme in all sectors/areas.
It would create jobs, satisfy demand, and allow us to actually house the mountains of people this government is currently irresponsibly shovelling in. Now is the perfect time to rebuild cities, rebuild communities, and build ourselves into a better nation.
Instead we have sycophants using this in all the wrong ways for their own gain while addressing no real issues whatsoever and providing no solutions. It's sickening and rage inducing because most common people can divine this with 5 minutes of thought, the fact our leaders so openly ignore such important issues is completely disheartening, especially given all parties would be doing the exact same thing. There is no one to vote for who would change this cancerous mindset our gov has.
Many of these new immigrants will not be able to find a home and they will be exploited by shitty businesses paying extremely low wages. And the only reason they're being brought into the country is so the government can pay for boomers' retirements.
Pure cruelty.

Thankfully our corperate overlords and emerging upper-class are doing the thinking for us.
More cheap labour for corporate Canada?
Oh man, with all these housing prices and lack of housing, I've only wish we could get more people here because I know that is what will fix it.
> High levels of foreign-born workers, for example, have helped to mitigate wage pressures in Canada in recent months at a time when inflation has been surging.
Translating from Bloomberg to human:
> things cost more but businesses don’t have to raise your wage
They want to keep wages low and the cost of living high. Write to Evans, flood his inbox. This is unacceptable.
I hope all the LPC voters are still happy with their choice, you folks voted for this. I can't wait until the average house hits ~$2M in <5 yrs, what a "progressive" country we'll have!
Time for a national referendum on immigration. The government seems to forget that they work for us.
"High levels of foreign-born workers, for example, have helped to mitigate wage pressures in Canada in recent months at a time when inflation has been surging."
Excellent news for the Elites led by the King of the Elites - JT. 
They can keep the money printer on, transferring wealth from the middle-class and poor to themselves. 
And, they get to maintain a low-cost labour force.
Humanity never changes.
Disgusting.
This is getting so god damn old.
Only party against it is the PPC and is enough to be a single issue for anyone sane at this point even with all their baggage. Hopefully we can pump the breaks in a few years.

It is awesome. Canadian team is definitely looks much better than majority of European teams I was watching during current UEFA qualifiers.
For those who downvotes this (and other soccer related) posts. Just curious about rationale. Do you mind to type here? 
Why not just to actually upvote current impressive performance of Canada and just say: Canada is great in many areas of life.
Instead of doing: boooo Canada...
We're actually much better than that right now - we beat Mexico in both the Azteca and the Iceteca, and they're rated 14th in the world. Fifa rankings are trash.
WOOT WOOOT!
We're number 40! We're number 40! Look the fuck out 39
Played some dirty pool to get it, but worth it to see how pissed Mexico is.
Let's gooo
Pumped to see Canadian men's soccer doing well. Love their style of play aswell. So fun to watch.
We just need home field advantage in Edmonton in November. We can defeat them all.
All jokes aside, this is very cool. I haven't paid much attention to soccer, but from my understanding this is is crafty work of the British GM of the team. Very cool story.
Depends which european countries, the majority of west europe will pound us but we have a solid team atm regardless
Tell me you know nothing about the sport without telling me you know nothing about the sport.
Draw at the Azteca, FWIW.
To be technically fair, we beat them when we were ranked 48 and they were ranked 9. 40 and 14 are the rankings updated after the win.
to be fair, winning against them once does not mean we are definitely better than them. There is a such thing as statistical variance
They did the same shit by playing at high altitude Stadiums
You did that just fine on your own.
Canada is better than the majority of European teams? 😂 I mean .. I wish… but I wanna know what kind of drugs you’re on
There are 45+ countries in Europe, and \~20 European countries ranked ahead of Canada.
I'd say it's pretty likely they're also currently outplaying a lot of those countries ranked ahead of them right now given they beat 14th ranked Mexico as well
In this round the last match with Mexico was a draw.
You failed to mention the draw against Mexico was at the Azteca, a stadium that is at 2000+ meters altitude and statistically extremely difficult to even draw at.
Canada’s sport shooting community is grateful.
THIS is how you keep people safe from gun violence. Not targeting hunters and sport shooters.
Thank you to the good people at the CBSA
But they still believe legal gun owners are also the problem..... 🤦 About time they made a big bust. Too bad it won't be in the news cycle
[deleted]
Take notes Ottawa this is how you fight gun violence. Great job CBSA!
Sarnia Ontario for those who don't know where 'Blue Water Bridge" is located...
Great job CBSA!
Almost as if focusing on smuggled guns is a better option than going after legal guns 🤔
The money this government is spending on attacking legal guns would buy a lot of border security.
"This proves that taking away guns from responsible legal Canadian gun owners is working"
So how are we going to blame this on target shooters?
How could Canadian farmers and responsible gun owners do such a thing
 /s
Those god damn hunters back at it again!😡
I wonder why all these guns keep coming from our neighbouring country with much looser controls.
Good for the CBSA.  Legal gun owners despise gun smugglers and criminal possession of firearms.
Someone tell Trudeau that’s how you get illegal guns off the street’s of Toronto and Vancouver
Nice, now sell them to us legal gun owners up here lol
News flash: CBSA doing their job, more at 11.
What do they hope for, a cookie? If 56 guns being seized is worthy of a news release, I'm actually worried yet not surprised of their overall effectiveness.
Time to ditch the OIC
Quick! Someone ban more legally purchased firearms to stop this!!

What they should really be doing is getting rid of it completely. Enough of this bullshit. I’m so sick of hearing from Tam and De Villa.
>"If a Canadian wanted to go across for a quick shopping trip in the U.S., **maybe get some cheap gas** or whatever
The bolded part, lmaoooooooooooo
Why not tomorrow? Always with the freaking delays
I don't understand why this doesn't apply to international students. If a person was in Canada <72 hours previously why does it matter if they're a citizen or PR or whatever?
I want to do Cuba. Only place in the world my mind is clear (been 12 times)
Dealing with Pearson is enough, adding on all this stuff is just a deal breaker. More stress than Im going to alleviate.
Sucks. Wish we had an "all inclusive" meal plan thing somewhere in this country that wasn't $800 a day.
Our cases keep creeping back upward, the holidays are approaching. I'm trying to make policy judgements based on evidence here but this seems....counterintuitive. Can anyone provide further interrogation of this decision?
&#x200B;
EDIT: Being downvoted for simply asking for justification. WOW.
I'd even compromise and accept a $40 rapid test at the border at this point (for trips over 72 hours) But nope.
It’s a trial balloon. They throw it out there and wait to see if peolle have a bad reaction to it
Because their response is completely political - they aren’t making policy based on health at this point and clearly haven’t been for quite some time now.
Because every decision they've made on this pandemic has been political. It is not science driven, it's politically driven so JT and crew can look like they're doing something.
I think because citizens/PRs enter by right, international students don't.
Cuba? What's it like there? I heard most people do resort packages
If you got infected with COVID right this minute, you wouldn't test positive until the infection took hold, probably 1-3 days from now. Plus, a PCR test usually takes 24-48 hours to return a result.
So, if you travel from Windsor to Detroit on Monday morning, planning to come back on Tuesday night, the only way you'd have a test result in time is if you took the test before you left Canada, and all it would tell anyone is that you didn't have COVID before you left on your trip.
So, if the test is essentially 0% effective at identifying people who bring COVID home from short trips, and the cost of the test is harming cross-border trade and family visits, then there's really no point having the test requirement.
What exactly are we keeping out with the PCR test? COVID including all variants of concern are already widespread in Canada. Testing and border restrictions have made no sense since like mid-2020.
Downvoted for complaining about downvotes
> I'd even compromise and accept a $40 rapid test at the border at this point (for trips over 72 hours) But nope.
Yeah this I could get behind.
Finally people are getting it. It's all political and about pharma profits.
I went there back in 2018 and I loved it. People were nice, resort was good, beaches were amazing. I think a lot of people do resorts but there's also a decent number of travellers who stay in Casa Particulares, sort of an AirBnB type thing iirc.
It's a beautiful country too but there isn't a lot of wealth among regular folk there. When we were there we did a tour in Havana and while it's still a beautiful city, there's a lot of poor individuals and areas.
That's an absolutely reasonable assessment. Thank you.
